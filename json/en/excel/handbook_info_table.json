The new medical equipment she saw optimized Originium transmission efficiency based upon new results obtained from life analysis, making possible a whole new generation of dazzling treatment possibilities. \nAfter completing her studies, Silence's wish came true and she was allowed to join Rhine Lab to work. She had an extraordinary talent in the Originium Arts field, and soon god the opportunity to participate in several experimental projects related to important Originium technology and clinical treatment. \nHowever, even though her career was going well and the upper levels of the company recognized her achievements, Silence never forgot her original dream - to join the Originium Technology and Life Science Applications project. \n\n\"I never thought the opportunity would come so soon.\" \nLooking back on this time, Silence let slip a sly smile.",

It was not fitted with a weapon, instead its only designated function was to provide timely treatment for Operators on the battlefield. \nMedicine that has undergone several rounds of testing by the Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical Team can be assembled into the drone's kits in a variety of ways. The drone can use aerosolized medicine, it can spray medicine, it can deliver medicine, and it can simulate a medic's treatment wand. It can switch between these modes depending on the needs of the terrain and the environment, and the specific situation of the Operator in need of healing. \nHowever, this medical drone is still in its experimental stages. Because it needs to be lightweight and convenient, it needs to be a kind of throwaway and relatively fragile low-value target. Additionally, in areas with strong signal interference and complex terrain, its efficiency will be affected to a certain degree. \nEven so, it still provides Rhodes Island Operators with quality treatment. Better still, this is just the first gift that Silence has brought to Rhodes Island.",

Judging by Ifrit's current symptoms, we can at least tell that the treatment did not succeed.\nAs one of the Rhodes Island medical team's more critical patients, Ifrit primarily receives care from Silence. This is consistent with information currently available from their time at Rhine Lab. Even after coming to Rhodes Island, the two have maintained the close relationship they built when they were both at Rhine Lab. \nIn terms of personality, Ifrit is a bit... immature. She acts like a 6-10 year old and is rebellious, impetuous, overly confident most of the time, and it could even be said she is egotistical. She is the kind of person to do something the second the idea pops into her mind, regardless of how dangerous it might be.\nOn the other hand, her fearlessness is her most outstanding Originium Arts and should be supported. Rhine Lab even created a flame-casting wand device to complement this talent. This gift pushed Ifrit to show off her abilities with even more bombast. \nIn short, after daily observation, we can say that Ifrit is someone who easily gets caught up in emotions. For now, she doesn't have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and she's quite immature. In an extreme environment such as a battlefield, herinstinctsimpel her to fight against and even annihilate all those who get in her way.

However, the structure of her horns and her tail are quite different from normal Sarkaz. Even though current research on the Sarkaz and their traits is incomplete, at least compared to the other Sarkaz present at Rhodes Island, Ifrit's characteristics are quite unique. \nThe Sarkaz race maintains a certain amount of talent when it comes to OriginiumArts, and Ifrit's talent far exceeds that of most Sarkaz. \nAccording to these observations, it is probable that Ifrit's racial characteristics have undergone some superficial changes triggered by her Oripathy. It's also possible that the Originium presence in her circulatory system is interfering with test results. These changes are irreversible and have led to an unexpected obstacle for the medical department's investigation: they are unable to determine which type of Sarkaz Ifrit is. \nIn addition, Ifrit's medical records show that she suffers from chronic muscle pain and even occasional hallucinations. It's possible that her irascible attitude may stem from the anxiety caused by the onset of pain. \nIn summary, Ifrit is an Operator that needs close monitoring, even at Rhodes Island. Anyone who comes into contact with Ifrit should have a full understanding of all this Operator's basic information before their exchange takes place.\n[Privileged Record]\nThis record exists because Ifrit's physiological structure has already become quite strange. \nShe was a Sarkaz, but whether she is still indeed Sarkaz, I am unsure...

This has meant that the people of Kjerag have not needed to rely on moving cities to live and work. Of course, the steep terrain has also slowed Kjerag's development considerably. \nThe name of the Karlan Trade Company is probably derived from the name of the holy mountain the believers of Kjerag worship. \nThe trade company, run by SilverAsh, is the only window to the outside world for the insular and conservative nation of Kjerag. At the same time, this company has unavoidably changed the country. \nThis degree of vision and power to execute means that it's worthwhile for Rhodes Island to look into SilverAsh's experience.",

LTD, is a controversial figure at Rhodes Island. \nWhatever the case, the other  Operators have come to a consensus: SilverAsh is not an Operator who can be easily dispatched or controlled. \nSilverAsh and his employees work very closely with Rhodes Island, but there is no hierarchical relationship between them. \nWhether it is strategic planning or tactical command, many Operators find SilverAsh's prowess convincing. However, the more skeptical Operators familiar with conspiracy and political tricks are wary of SilverAsh's intentions. \nAlthough SilverAsh truly cares about his younger sister, Cliffheart, who is being treated at Rhodes Island, he trusts Rhodes Island no more than Rhodes Island trusts him. \nPerhaps as the rumor says, what is really of interest to SilverAsh is the value of Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals itself as well as the Doctor he regards as a competent rival... \nDr. Kal'tsit is opposed to trying to make any further contact with SilverAsh, though perhaps for reasons of her own.",

However, evidence at the scene pointed to political enemies of the Silverash clan. However, perhaps because the Silverash Family's decline was too rapid, this matter was left unsettled. \nNaturally, the incident had a huge effect on young SilverAsh's life. However, SilverAsh was the scion of a wealthy family and not a weakling to boot. He never sank into despair, and even kept raising his two younger sisters until they were old enough to take care of themselves. \nAfterward, SilverAsh left Kjerag and headed to Victoria to receive a modern education, and let the Silverash's political enemies divide up their political legacy amongst themselves. The Three House Parliament of Kjerag was three houses in name only. \nThis state of affairs lasted until SilverAsh returned back to Kjerag. After coming home, SilverAsh took upon himself the heavy responsibility of rebuilding his clan. \nOf course, according to Cliffheart's testimony, the SilverAsh who had returned was no longer the gentle and precocious youngster he used to be - he was now a patient and durable young man. \nThereafter, the Karlan Trade Company quickly rose to seize a monopoly in a large number of modern industries that had previously been banned in Kjerag. He exported goods and raw materials to other countries and imported modern industrial products. In doing so, he accumulated a vast amount of wealth in a very short time, and the success of his company restored the Silverash Family name to its position in the parliament. \nPerhaps due to political conspiracy, SilverAsh's two younger sisters both suffered an event that would have a huge impact on the Silverash family: Pramanix was christened a Karlan Saintess in a religious ritual, and Cliffheart was infected with Oripathy. \nRhodes Island tends to believe that these were acts of political rebellion, but Cliffheart thinks that these events merely once again catalyzed SilverAsh's resolve. \nNow, no one knows what SilverAsh will do, just as no one knows the purpose behind his collaboration with Rhodes Island.",

The conflict between the Kjerag conservative faction and the reformist party have gotten more and more intense.\nOn the surface, the Karlan Trade Company is only concerned with foreign trade. However, its true owner is none other than Enciodas Silverash, head of the Silverash Family and enemy of the two conservative houses in the country's parliament.\nYou may also know him as SilverAsh, brother of Rhodes Island Operator, Cliffheart.\nI am convinced that the Karlan Trade Company doesn't pay a cent to the government of Kjerag. It isn't a state-owned enterprise! Its operations and business are controlled entirely by SilverAsh himself!\nModern military equipment has passed from Thor Industrial's hands, through the Karlan Trade Company's channels, and into Kjerag. The conservative faction doesn't even have any means of tracing the whereabouts of the goods.\nThe trade route has already been moved to the foot of the holy mountain, Karlan. The Vine Court has already used SilverAsh's sister, Saint Pramanix, as leverage to try to get the Silverash family to leave the Three House Parliament and hand over control of the valley and mining sites.\nThe troops the Karlan Trade Company sent to the training camps have already returned from Askar County in Victoria.

Just the tiniest little push...\nThe avalanche will bury all of Kjerag, including all of its conspiracies and all of the matters of the past.\n\nI admit that perhaps the Karlan Trade Company isn't hiding anything dangerous.\nEven so, should we really put ourselves in danger just because Cliffheart received a secret letter?\nAt the very least, Rhodes Island as a whole should not assume this magnitude of risk.\n\n --Dobermann, at the meeting 12 days before the incident at the mountain",

The official contract is too long and complicated to go into here, though it could probably be summed up in three clauses: \nOne, Penguin Logistics is responsible for Sora's personal safety, and must not let her make any appearance that would damage her image as a pop idol. \nTwo, wherever Sora goes on a mission, Penguin Logistics is obligated to do their best to promote her and increase her popularity as they see fit, as well as absorbing all costs incurred. \nThree, including events or activities described in Clause 2, all revenue derived from Sora's performance as an entertainer must go to the management agency. \nViolation of any clause is ground for the agency to terminate the contract to revoke Sora as an Operator. \nFollowing PL's partnership with Rhodes Island, the latter also assumed all the obligations.

Fortunately, the impairment has slowed given treatment at Rhodes Island. \nEyjafjalla typically uses a hearing aid, or asks her conversant to repeat loudly themselves in order to communicate. \nIn addition, certain facial expressions and body language have also proven effective. For example: \nShaking head: Unsuccessful dialogue. \nShaking head with a surprised expression: Very likely some words have been misunderstood and should be clarified immediately. \nNodding: Successful dialogue. \nNoding with a positive expression: Idea successfully communicated, proceed with dialogue. Still, one must be mindful of the context, since the present dialogue might be built on the pretext of a previously unnoticed misunderstanding. \nRepeating a word or sentence multiple times: Eyjafjalla is confirming what's been communicated to her, respond positively and mind one's volume. \nGlassy-eyed or negative expression: Misunderstanding has possibly occurred. Review previous dialogue to avoid greater misunderstanding.",

Vigna herself has also stepped up her own personal combat training in order to improve her mastery over the unique tool. \nVigna has never felt she could or would ever quit.

The huge fire rescue operation last winter more than proved Shaw's competence: When the irresponsible use of a space heater eventually set a whole building ablaze, Shaw made numerous incursions inside to rescue trapped victims, orchestrating a successful operation with zero casualties. That earned her a personal invite from Wei Yenwu, Chief Executive of Lungmen, as well as headlines in all the newspapers. \nWith Wei's and the L.G.D's support, Shaw was accepted into Rhodes Island for her expertise in fire safety and prevention. It was an obvious boon to the island, since most Operators have little to no knowledge of or training in firefighting. Shaw handily filled the gap. \nWhen Shaw had the chance to inspect the intricate passageways and firefighting equipment on the island, and after meeting certain Operators who wield fire Arts at will, she realized she faced a daunting task.",

The first seminar commenced with the notable absence of Dr. Kal'tsit, where Shaw presented materials and slides (including various scenes of major fires and warning signs). The presentation was short, thanks to Shaw's famously fast rate of speech, and the raucous applause made it clear the audience had no clue what she had intended to communicate to them.
