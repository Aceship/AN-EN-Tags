[name="Hermann"]   In the past 15 years, you learned nothing from me.
[name="Hermann"]   All that you got is just some filthy moves. What an idiot.

[name="Cronin"]   It's too late to control the broadcast tower now! The people will only panic!
[name="Cronin"]   The volcano is about to become active, but do you really think you can figure out something with those simple statistics?
[name="Cronin"]   All the secret passages are under my control! None of you can run away!
[name="Cronin"]   You hypocrites can save no one!
[name="Cronin"]   Everything will be destroyed with the city!

[name="Eyjafjalla"]   Doctor, can you hear me! The analysis of the volcano is done!
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   We still have a chance to buy more time!
[name="Provence"]   Doctor, we already found the reason for the activity. There's a good chance to stop the eruption!
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   Now please calm down and listen carefully. This method can definitely delay the eruption!

[Character(name="char_188_helage_1")]
[name="Hellagur"]   We can help, if it really helps.
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#2")]
[name="Schwarz"]   ...Yeah.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   No, please leave it to us.
[name="Ceylon"]   Cronin has planned on this for long. His men must be all over the city.
[name="Ceylon"]   This is the critical moment. Schwarz, Mr. Hellagur, you've got your duty.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]

[name="Ceylon"]   But it's our mission.

[Character(name="avg_npc_024")]
[name="Hermann"]   Ceylon...
[Character]
[name="Provence"]   Agreed.
[name="Provence"]   We're Catastrophe Messenger, volcanologist and Originium researcher. None of us will just watch a predictable crisis pose a threat to the citizens.
[name="Provence"]   Besides, this guy actually used his knowledge to deceive the people and benefit himself. As a Catastrophe Messenger, I can't just stand by watching him do that.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1")]
[name="Hellagur"]   Didn't see you could be that serious. Got it. So, Mr. Mayor, please allow me to help you with the evacuation.
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#2",name2="avg_npc_024",focus=2)]
[name="Hermann"]   ... Okay. Schwarz, join me.

[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#3",name2="avg_npc_024",focus=2)]
[name="Hermann"]   Ceylon said she can do it.
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#2")]
[name="Schwarz"]   ... Please be careful, my lady.
[Character]
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   Got a conclusion? We don't have much time!

[name="Cronin"]   Hahahaha... They will die for nothing! You may buy an hour or two, so what!?
[name="Cronin"]   Over half of Siesta will be buried with your daughter, and you won't even find her body...

[name="Hellagur"]   Sorry. Can't control myself.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_024",focus=2)]
[name="Hermann"]   It's okay. Besides he's right. We can't keep the citizens in danger anymore.
[name="Hermann"]   Hope you can give me a hand.
