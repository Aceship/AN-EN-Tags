[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]   Your prestige has already fallen, Hermann!
[name="Cronin"]   These people are all trained by me these years and they only work for me! They know what it means to work hard for a better life!
[name="Cronin"]   Today is the climax of the festival. I'll take what I deserve and leave here.
[name="Cronin"]   You still have no idea, huh?
[name="Cronin"]   Let me tell you for mercy's sake. The data you got from the monitoring station is wrong! The volcano will soon become completely active.
[name="Cronin"]   The Originium will spread along with the eruption. At least half of the city will be destroyed!
[name="Cronin"]   But I won't lose anything, and I'll even come back after the eruption and mine the Originium here!
[name="Cronin"]   Siesta is my paradise! I knew it! I love it as much as you do, Hermann!

[Character(name="avg_npc_024")]
[name="Hermann"]  How dare you say that!
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]   Of course I can, as the Catastrophe Messenger of this city.
[name="Cronin"]   But you can only witness your defeat and the destruction of Siesta!
[name="Cronin"]   And, at long last, die with honor in the eruption. No one can bring these secrets out of this city, except me.

[name="Cronin"]   ... Rhodes, Island.

[name="Hermann"]   I'm so disappointed at you, Cronin.
[Character(name="avg_npc_024",name2="avg_npc_023_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Cronin"]   Disappointed? You are disappointed? I should be the disappointed one!
[name="Cronin"]   I will never forget those days, when I became homeless and had to sleep in a trash bin!
[name="Cronin"]   Money is the gate to a new life. I understood it at that time! And what did you do? We worked so hard to make money, but you used to help those infected craps!?
[name="Cronin"]   Are you gonna bury the value of Siesta with your hypocrisy!?
[Character(name="avg_npc_024",name2="avg_npc_023_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hermann"]   Take a good look at yourself, Cronin.
[name="Hermann"]   And think about what you saw in the jail!
