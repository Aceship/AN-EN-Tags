[name="Amiya"]   Doctor, I must blame you for this.
[name="Amiya"]   Everyone's a bit injured. You're responsible for that as the leader!
[name="Amiya"]   Gummy has treated them already, but it's still gonna hurt if they get into the water.
[name="Amiya"]   Oh please, don't go too far even if we're on vacation.

[name="Amiya"]   And I gotta asked Mr. Hellagur why he didn't stop you!
[name="Amiya"]   I told him to keep an eye on you. Turns out that was a blind eye...
[name="Amiya"]   Before we sign a contract, Rhodes Island should stay out of the business of any independent cities.
[name="Amiya"]   If we got dragged into the trouble here, Rhodes Island will be in a tight spot, and we may even get trapped.

[name="Hermann"]   Dr. {@nickname}, nice to see you.
[name="Hermann"]   Ceylon told me things about Rhodes Island. I would like to talk to you.

[name="Hermann"]   I trained Cronin myself. He's ambitious, but capable as well. That's why I turned a blind eye on him these years.
[name="Hermann"]   But he kinda went the wrong way lately. I can't completely trust him.
[name="Hermann"]   I left Schwarz here on purpose when I went to the new development zone this time, just to see if he's still trustworthy.
[name="Hermann"]   But the result is disappointing.

[name="Hermann"]   ... I like walking along this beach.
[name="Hermann"]   Because Barbara, my wife, sleeps deep down this ocean.
[name="Hermann"]   I still remember that day. It was a bit hot, and the setting sun was beautiful. She said to me "If only we could live here forever".
[name="Hermann"]   And now I've been alone for long.
[name="Hermann"]   Doctor, look back.
[name="Hermann"]   Do you understand? This city is a paradise I build for her.
[name="Hermann"]   As for why I say this to you...
[name="Hermann"]   Because I can tell you and I are the same kinda person.
[name="Hermann"]   In this world, not everything can be solved with those good things. Sometimes we have to use those bad things.
[Decision(options="我是。;我不是。;谁知道呢。",values="1;2;3")]

[name="Hermann"]   Good and bad means nothing to me since long ago. All I care about is results, and this city.

[name="Hermann"]   I'm not looking for someone who can understand me, Doctor.
[name="Hermann"]   If I needed her understanding, we wouldn't have been like this now.
[name="Hermann"]   Besides, do you really think she'll understand if I told her?
[name="Hermann"]   No. She still needs a long time to understand the world is not so organized as she thinks.
[name="Hermann"]   Schwarz hopes she doesn't understand it forever, while I... Pity but I lost the chance to make the choice.
[name="Hermann"]   Doctor, Ceylon would like to join you, so I asked Schwarz to go with her. I'm fine with it.
[name="Hermann"]   ‘Cause Siesta is not her paradise anymore.
[name="Hermann"]   I checked the new geologic report. Siesta will come to an end in lava one day.
[name="Hermann"]   We delayed its arrival. Thank you for your efforts.
[name="Hermann"]   All these years I've been looking for a way to solve this problem thoroughly. I found it, but the price will be huge.
[name="Hermann"]   The new development zone I've been working on will become a brand new mobile city. I think it will become a new Siesta.
[name="Hermann"]   I have deep love for this place, but that doesn't mean I'll just ignore the volcano that is taking a nap beside us.
[name="Hermann"]   After this festival, we'll abandon this Siesta and move into the mobile city. It will be buried by lava one day.

[name="Hermann"]   I heard this ocean has its boundary. Some said it's not a real ocean. It may be wide, but not boundless.
[name="Hermann"]   We'll go along its boundary then. Perhaps one day, we'll return to the starting point, for real.
[name="Hermann"]   It's just this beautiful beach, this great Obsidian Festival, and this coastal city with volcanic smell...
[name="Hermann"]   The Siesta that holds the memory of countless Siestan, will be gone forever.
[name="Hermann"]   Perhaps one day, you can tell these words to her.
[name="Hermann"]   Or not.
[name="Hermann"]   And if one day she needs help, come find me.
[name="Hermann"]   No matter where Siesta is or what it is like, this city will support her forever.
[name="Hermann"]   No, I should say... As long as Siestans exist, Siesta exists. Young people like them are where Siesta really is.

[name="Hermann"]   At least before we find another suitable stage, we can only suspend the cooperation with Monster Siren Records. I should go have a talk with them now.
[name="Hermann"]   Seems Schwarz has something to tell you. She's over there.
[name="Hermann"]   She will have nothing to say if I talk too much. Go talk to her.

[name="Schwarz"]   All these years I had tried to keep her away from these things as I wished, but perhaps you're right. She has her own idea and responsibility.
