[name="Ceylon"]   You know what, when I was a child, this beach was not this busy. I liked making castle alone there.
[name="Ceylon"]   ... This city is getting better every year, thanks to my father.
[name="Ceylon"]   My father and I, well, don't talk a lot.
[name="Ceylon"]   I've been thinking. Compared to talking to me, are money and this city more important to him?
[name="Ceylon"]   My mother died when she gave birth to me. Sometimes I may think if that's the reason why he doesn't like me.
[name="Ceylon"]   And it feels like he doesn't care if I like him. Ever since I have memory, he's often out on business. Rather than father and daughter, we're more like two strangers living in the same house.

[name="Ceylon"]   As I remember, he's the grandson of the owner of Mocking Bird Cafe in Second Avenue.
[name="Ceylon"]   I used to go there a lot. His grandpa was a kind man. Her wife already passed away at that time, so he decorated the cafe with her favorite flowers and bonsai, and played their favorite music.
[name="Ceylon"]   By the way, he did say he's too old to run the cafe, and he's gonna pass it to his grandson.
[name="Ceylon"]   Time flies.

[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Because I have Oripathy, my lady.
[name="Schwarz"]   It's bad for your health to come close to me. You can call me only when it's necessary.

[name="Schwarz"]   And...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Then I gotta find the cure!
[name="Ceylon"]   Hum, you'll see! One day I'll beat it and take Schwarz back to me.

[name="Ceylon"]   The reason I started the research on Originium is that she's infected. I want to find the cure for her.
[name="Ceylon"]   It has always inspired me. I even went to Victoria to study for this dream.
[name="Ceylon"]   The research was really hard. At the beginning, I couldn't even understand the basic concepts, and I felt like giving up several times, but I hanged in there at last.
[name="Ceylon"]   Victoria was so far from Siesta. I couldn't get used to it at the beginning.

[name="Ceylon"]   No wonder you're a doctor. Looks like I still got a lot to learn.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4")]
[name="Ceylon"]   It seems what I should do is to stop being emotional and find the proof.
[name="Ceylon"]   If they are really putting the citizens in danger, I'll stop them at all costs!
[name="Ceylon"]   Since I trust my own choice, even if no one's with me, I'll fight to save this city!

[name="Ceylon"]   Yes. Mr. Hellagur, Doctor, could you listen to me?
[name="Ceylon"]   No matte what, I don't want to see the citizens get into danger. That's the top priority for me.
[name="Ceylon"]   The largest broadcast tower here is located beside Garrison Amusement Park. It controls the whole broadcast system of the city.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Broadcast tower?
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   But it's controlled by Cronin's men. He often speaks to the citizens there.
[name="Ceylon"]   When the show begins, a great number of people will gather at the stage. By then his men will be busy keeping order.
[name="Ceylon"]   As long as we control the tower at that time, we can spread the news to the whole city.
[name="Ceylon"]   So please give me a hand.
