[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Welcome back, Doctor.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Please don't feel too bad about what happened in Chernobog... At least we rescued you. The mission was a success and our sacrifices were not in vain.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Together, we still have a long way to go.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] That's why I want to show you some strategies that can be applied in the future.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] On the battlefield, our Operators may not be able to defeat all enemies head-on. In many occasions, we need to use creative strategies to take them down.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] By doing so, we can minimize our losses and preserve our strength for future operations.
