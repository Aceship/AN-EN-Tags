[name="Dobermann"]  What in the world... is going on here?

[name="Reunion Member"]  Search all these houses! I want every single room turned inside out!
[name="Female"]  Let go of me...! No! You can't...
[name="Reunion Member"]  Trying to resist? Too late, you filthy Chernos!
[name="Male"]  Just run! Don't worry about me... Save... our child...
[name="Child"]  Mama... Mama...!
[name="Ursus Guard"]  Forget about the civilians! Hold the line first! There are too many masked goons coming!
[name="Reunion Member"]  Don't give the cops any time to rest! Keep attacking!
[name="Ursus Guard"]  Where are our reinforcements?! We're going to get overrun...
[name="Reunion Member"]  Attack, attack!!

[name="Amiya"]  What's going on...? ! Why... Why is Reunion doing this...?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  After all these years, the wolves in sheep's clothing finally bare their fangs.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic"]  The Infected... they, they're attacking the Ursus troops!
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Guard"]  But why?! Challenging the Ursus government like this is basically suicide!
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  No, look at how fierce this attack is. This must have been a planned operation.
[name="Dobermann"]  The place we rescued Doctor from was supposed to be top secret... but they somehow still managed to infiltrate it.
[name="Dobermann"]  It's possible that Reunion's attack has already spread through Chernobog in its entirety.
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Guard"]  No... How, how can that be...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  Shhhh!

[name="Reunion Member A"]  Have you found any of those fleeing Chernos yet?
[name="Reunion Member B"]  I'm still looking!
[name="Reunion Member A"]  Good, don't let a single one get away!
[name="Reunion Member A"]  Those cold-blooded beasts... I'll make them pay for what they did to my family!

[name="Dobermann"]  Amiya...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  I'm aware of the risk, Instructor Dobermann.
[name="Amiya"]  It's just that... we don't have the luxury of sitting around waiting for Reunion to disband.
[name="Amiya"]  Additionally, nobody knows how long this situation will last...
[name="Amiya"]  Therefore, the best course of action would be to take out the enemy and then get moving. Wouldn't you agree?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  ...
[name="Dobermann"]  Understood. I'll follow your command.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  All squads, listen up.
[name="Dobermann"]  We have the element of surprise - these Reunion members don't know that we're here yet.
[name="Dobermann"]  Remember, be decisive! Take them out, cleanly and swiftly.
[name="Dobermann"]  Dr {@nickname}, gather your team. It's time for you to prove yourself.
[name="Dobermann"]  We have no more time to second-guess ourselves.
