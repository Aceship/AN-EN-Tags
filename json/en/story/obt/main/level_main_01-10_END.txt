[name="Dobermann"]  Shh...
[name="Dobermann"]  ...Don't let Amiya hear you.

[name="Nearl"]  Amiya's kept a clear head through this! She's a lot more mature than we thought...!

[name="Dobermann"]  Even if that's the case, we can't let her hear this!
[name="Dobermann"]  We mustn't burden her any further. She's already... carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders.
[name="Dobermann"]  ...We can't... let their efforts go to waste!
[name="Dobermann"]  They made the ultimate choice to let us live, so we have to return the favor... by making sure Amiya and the Doctor return safely.

[name="Nearl"]  ...
[name="Nearl"]  That's right.
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_1#2", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  Now isn't the time to be dejected.
[name="Dobermann"]  As the Radiant Knight, shouldn't you always be our beacon of hope, no matter what happens?

[name="Nearl"]  ...
[name="Nearl"]  ... I'm not sure anymore. But, I will do my part.
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_1#3")]
[name="Nearl"]  Regroup! Don't let your guard down! We're almost there!

[name="Dobermann"]  ...
[name="Dobermann"]  *sigh*...
[name="Dobermann"]  Those who told me not to worry... None of them ended up coming back.

[name="Amiya"]  Mm, I'm fine. I can walk on my own...

[name="Amiya"]  What about Ace and the others…?

[name="Amiya"]  I see.

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2")]

[name="Amiya"]  It's okay. I'm sure Ace will be fine.
[name="Amiya"]  Everyone in Rhodes Island is very strong.
[name="Amiya"]  We're almost at the south exit. Once we leave Chernobog, we'll be...

[name="Mephisto"]  How did that guy... manage to do this...
[name="Mephisto"]  Half of the city was burnt to ashes, the entire plaza became a sea of flames... Steel was melting and reforming...
[name="Mephisto"]  But how was he... able to keep fighting?
[Character(name="char_1505_frstar_1")]
