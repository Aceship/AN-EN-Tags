[name="Liskarm"]   ...
[name="Liskarm"]   What the hell...
[name="Liskarm"]   All that, for only a single Reunion squad...
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1")]
[name="Franka"]   And a really big guy.
[name="Franka"]   Now that was the highlight. I'm totally exhausted just from dealing with him!

[Character(name="char_136_hsguma")]

[name="Hoshiguma"]   Impossible.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   How could so many Infected vanish so quickly?
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Was that giant guy just a diversion?

[name="Amiya"]   ...
[name="Amiya"]   Did Reunion manage to completely evacuate this area in such a short period of time?

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]

[name="Amiya"]   No... Madam Ch'en should have blocked off their escape route...

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1")]

[name="Franka"]   I'm not seeing the designated waypoint.
[name="Franka"]   Something... isn't right about this.
[name="Franka"]   Weeds, ruins, sand dunes...
[name="Franka"]   All of which are potential spots for an ambush...
[name="Franka"]   But, I'm not seeing anything.
[name="Franka"]   No footsteps, no sounds of clothing brushing against plants, no smell of explosives...
[name="Franka"]   I can't tell what's going on!
[name="Franka"]   Penguin Logistics, wake up and do your job!
[name="Franka"]   This isn't right at all!
