[name="???"]   Hurry, hide!
[name="???"]   I... I need to go.
[name="???"]   Take this... this is for you.
[name="???"]   This is a protective charm. My mother taught me how to these...
[name="???"]   And this is one that I made.
[name="???"]   When you make these dolls by hand, you can keep the ones you care about safe.

[name="Amiya"]   According to Exusiai's data, our mission target should have been staying somewhere around here...
[name="Amiya"]   Argh, the terrain around here is really complicated. If we were doing this alone, this assignment might have been quite troublesome...

[name="Franka"]   Okay.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   The deeper we head into the slums, the more volatile things are going to be...
[name="Amiya"]   There are ordinary civilians, criminals, and refugees - all mixed together.
[name="Amiya"]   We'll have to make thorough preparations.

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="char_107_liskam_1",focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]   Amiya, I've just received another message from several defenders.
