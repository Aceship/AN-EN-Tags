[name="Amiya"]   --? !
[name="Amiya"]   We have to go up to the rooftop?
[name="Amiya"]   ...This door is locked.

[name="Liskarm"]   Stand back, I'll blast it open--

[name="Texas"]   ...
[name="Texas"]   There's no need for that.

[name="Franka"]   Liskarm, you should learn from her.

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]

[name="Liskarm"]   I have my own way of doing things. Got a problem with that?!

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]

[name="Amiya"]   There's another rooftop in front of us...

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6")]

[name="Amiya"]   I think I'm beginning to understand...

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6")]

[name="Amiya"]   Where is "there"... Are you telling us to--
[name="Amiya"]   Jump from rooftop to rooftop?

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Exusiai"]   Bingo~!
[name="Exusiai"]   Who would ever expect this? See, this is foolproof!
[name="Exusiai"]   You know, Lungmen is a great place with many secret--

[name="Amiya"]   Exusiai, the enemy showed up unexpectedly...

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1")]

[name="Franka"]   I already sealed off the entrance, so how...

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]

[name="Amiya"]  Could they have come from the nearby buildings...
[name="Amiya"]  They seem to be wearing some rudimentary jetpack, but it's enough to get the job done.
[name="Amiya"]  We'd be at a disadvantage if they manage to sneak through places we aren't able to defend...

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Exusiai"]   Tch... Hold on, I'll be there to help you shortly.

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1")]

[name="Franka"]   Don't take too long, my little guardian angel.

[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1")]

[name="Liskarm"]   Defenders, get into formation! Pronto!

[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]

[name="Texas"]   ...I'm going in.

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]

[name="Amiya"]   Everyone, protect our vanguard!
