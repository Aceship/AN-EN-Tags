[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   S-sorry, I didn't mean to run into you...

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2")]

[name="Amiya"]   Don't worry about it. You're very polite.

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   Ehehe...
[name="Child"]   Um, ma'am, what are you doing here?
[name="Child"]   It's still raining. You're not going to go inside?


[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]

[name="Amiya"]   Ah, um... I'm just... taking a walk.
[name="Amiya"]   Are you looking for help?

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   Oh! How'd you know?!

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2")]

[name="Amiya"]   I can't tell you~ It's a secret.
[Character(fadetime=0)]
[name="Child"]   Aw... it's fine though!
[name="Child"]   Ma'am, do you think...
[name="Child"]   Hmm... that probably won't work. You're a bit too short...


[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]

[name="Amiya"]   Hey, you shouldn't say stuff like that! You're shorter than me!

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]  Whoa!
[name="Child"]  W-well, we could try... Um, could you help me move that board? Let's do it together!
[name="Child"]  There's a record player under that metal rack. I want to take it back home.


[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]

[name="Amiya"]   Sure.

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   1... 2... 3! Together!

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2")]

[name="Amiya"]   We did it!

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   Woah, you're really strong, ma'am! Thank you!

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]

[name="Amiya"]   But... this record player is broken.

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   It's okay! It's always been broken.
[name="Child"]   But one day, I'll be able to fix it. I collected a lot of records, but I've never listened to them before...
[name="Child"]   ...But one day, I'll play them for everyone!

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]

[name="Amiya"]   ...
[name="Amiya"]   ...Such a difficult thing, said so casually...
[name="Amiya"]   ...What am I doing this for... What can I even do...

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   Ma'am, you're not scared of me?

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]

[name="Amiya"]   ...Scared of what?

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   I'm an Infected!

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2")]

[name="Amiya"]   Haha... I am too.

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   What?! That's such a pity. You're so pretty, too...!

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6")]

[name="Amiya"]   ...

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3")]

[name="Amiya"]   There's nothing wrong with being an Infected. Whether you are healthy or infected...
[name="Amiya"]   If you're a good person, that will never change.

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   Huh...? I don't get it...
[name="Child"]   (Grrrrrr...)

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]

[name="Amiya"]   ...Are you hungry?

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   ...Mmhm...

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]

[name="Amiya"]   ...Here, take this. It's all I have.

[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Child"]   Wow! Thank you, ma'am!
[name="Child"]   But... why did you come here?

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]

[name="Amiya"]   I...
[Blocker(a=1, r=0, g=0, b=0, fadetime=1, block=true)]
[name="Amiya"]   It's because...

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#10")]

[name="Amiya"]   It's because I made a promise to someone.

[name="Amiya"]   Even a child like that... In the end, will just...

Those who were robbed of their identity. The Infected. You've long lost the right to call yourselves people.

[name="Amiya"]   What can I accomplish? What more... can I do...?
[name="Amiya"]   Why... can I not protect those around me...

You cannot.

[name="Amiya"]   No... I...

Famine... Persecution... Death...
These are the only things awaiting the Infected.

[name="Amiya"]   No, that's not true...
[name="Amiya"]   As long as Rhodes Island is fighting for the Infected...

You are but one of the few lucky ones.


[name="Amiya"]   No... We've all come together to fight towards a common goal.


This world has already become cold and callous.

[name="Amiya"]   No, not yet...
[name="Amiya"]   The Infected can't succumb to despair just yet...

You.

Allow the rage to consume you.

Only then...
