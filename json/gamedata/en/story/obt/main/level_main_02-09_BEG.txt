[name="Liskarm"]   Why are there so many Reunion members here?!

[name="Reunion Member"]   Aaargh!

[name="Franka"]   Am I the only one who thinks that there are more and more of them coming?

[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2")]
[name="Reunion Member"]   Ugh!!
[Character(fadetime=0.2)]

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]

[name="Liskarm"]   Nope. It's clear that they have more reinforcements coming.

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]

[name="Amiya"]   Curses... We still haven't had a chance to avenge them yet...!

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]

[name="Liskarm"]   They ended up finding us first.
[name="Liskarm"]   Franka, look.
[name="Liskarm"]   Over by the east exit, I think those are Reunion's casters hiding over there.



[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]

[name="Franka"]   A lot of them approaching from the central passage as well as from the high-rises to our sides...
[name="Franka"]   ...They're trying to sneak over while pretending like they haven't noticed us yet.
[name="Franka"]   But, we're on top of the roof...
[name="Franka"]   No matter how many they send at us, they'll be doomed if they get knocked over...
[name="Franka"]   I feel like they're insulting my intelligence by launching an attack as brazen as this...



[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=2)]

[name="Amiya"]   Is Reunion launching their offensive?

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#7", focus=2)]

[name="Amiya"]   All operators, regroup!

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#7", focus=1)]

[name="Franka"]   Wait, I think I just saw...
[name="Franka"]   Isn't that the Reunion commander we ran into earlier?

[name="Skullshatterer"]   Did you turn her over to Lungmen?

[name="Amiya"]   (We'll have to make our way down once they're too afraid to keep attacking us!)
[name="Amiya"]   (We'll have to spread out the battlefield for now!)
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_106_franka_1",focus=2)]
[name="Franka"]   (Understood. We'll be doing a hit and run then!)

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]

[name="Amiya"]   What does it have to do with you?

[Character(name="char_1500_skulsr")]
[name="Skullshatterer"]    ...How dare you!

[name="Skullshatterer"]    My comrades, attaaack!
