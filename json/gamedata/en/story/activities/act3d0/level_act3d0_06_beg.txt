[name="Cronin"]    It's about time. As long as Schwarz and Rhodes Island can hold each other, things will go smooth here.
[name="Cronin"]    I knew setting them against each other would work well. Hum.
[name="Cronin"]    Hurry up! Get them away! Move fast or you won't get paid!
[name="Cronin"]    Oh? What's that sound out there?

[name="Ceylon"]   Doctor, if we just rush into the broadcast tower, I'm sure we'll run into Cronin's ambush.
[name="Ceylon"]   If you go with me, Schwarz will definitely try to disarm you guys first. In that case I can't contain her at all.
[name="Ceylon"]   With support from the government, even if we capture the broadcast tower by force, my words will only confuse the people and even make them panic.
[name="Ceylon"]   If Schwarz is guarding Cronin, she will be a big obstacle in your way.
[name="Ceylon"]   More importantly, you may need to find out what Cronin is hiding.
[name="Ceylon"]   Perhaps Cronin is really as innocent as a lamp...
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]     In that case, we just make him announce the news by force?
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Exactly. If that's the case, I don't mind using force. After all that's actually what I'm thinking.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]     That's bold, Miss Ceylon, even a bit reckless.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Rhodes Island has already used my data to prove the conclusion for me. If I don't do that, everyone in Siesta will get burned.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]     I'm not trying to blame you, Miss Ceylon. It's just I don't get to decide if Rhodes Island will take part in it.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   You mean...
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]     Doctor. You're clear about the whole thing now. What should we do?

[name="Ceylon"]   Doctor...

[Decision(options="做你该做的事吧。",values="1")]

[name="Ceylon"]   Okay. I'll go contain Schwarz.
[name="Ceylon"]   Besides, I have to do something. I need to know the answer...

[name="Ceylon"]   Schwarz...
[name="Ceylon"]   Why did you keep away from me?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   …
[name="Schwarz"]   You have received higher education in Victoria, my lady. You deserve a better place. Please don't struggle with people like us in this city.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   ... No. That's not right at all.
[name="Ceylon"]   Schwarz, do you know what I think of you? And what do you think of me?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I am not the person you think I am, my lady.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Is it because you used to kill people?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   …
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Because you've killed a lot of them?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   No, my lady. Enough.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Maybe both of us have made a mistake, Schwarz.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I don't want you to know that, my lady!
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   I'm sorry.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   ... My lady?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   I already know. I already know your past... even if it's just a small part.
[name="Ceylon"]   If you don't want me to know that, I understand, but sorry I can't say "I know nothing about it".
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   No, my lady! You are not supposed to know that! You should have...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Should have what? Studied well and ascended to the upper class? Forget it!
[name="Ceylon"]   I'm not a spoiled child, or some ignorant little princess! I know there's something I must do!
[name="Ceylon"]   To protect Siesta is dad's responsibility, your responsibility, and my responsibility!
[name="Ceylon"]   You want me to stay out of this in order to protect me, right?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   No... I...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   You are just like dad. Arrange everything for me and think that's for my own good, but I don't think so!
[name="Ceylon"]   There may be danger in what I do, you may have a dark past, so what!? Perhaps I'll cry and feel sad or even terrified when I actually go through them...
[name="Ceylon"]   But, as long as you say "I need your help, Ceylon", I'll always be there! No matter what you say, I'll always listen to you!
[name="Ceylon"]   That's what friends really do! If one of us just keeps giving, giving and giving, what kind of friends are we!?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   So, Schwarz, could you help me now?
[name="Ceylon"]   You've asked me for the reason. And that's my answer...
[name="Ceylon"]   So, could you give me an answer in return, Schwarz? If the past is in the past, can we be friends again? Like we did when I was a kid?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#5",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   My lady... I'm sorry. I apologize for my words and deeds. What I did has caused misunderstanding between us. It shouldn't have happened.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#5",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Ah...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   My lady, you are my friend, and you'll always be.

[name="Cronin's Man"]   Hey, that's too long for a chit chat. You got a conclusion? What is it?

[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   My lady, now please tell me your next step.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Huh? I... Well... I would like to spread the news about the Catastrophe through official channels.
[name="Ceylon"]   Rhodes Island should be collecting evidence against Cronin now. Soon he'll be kicked out of the City Council...
[name="Ceylon"]   But after the news is sent, probably the festival will have to be cancelled, and Siesta will have to move. I'm afraid...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   It's okay, my lady.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Re-Really?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   If that's what you want, I'm with you.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   ... Schwarz...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   My lady, do you need me to protect you?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Well, yes.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Please take cover. It will be over in a minute.
[Character(name="avg_npc_020")]
[name="Cronin's Man"]   Schwarz, what are you doing? Are you gonna disobey Mr. Cronin's order?
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#2")]
[name="Schwarz"]   Order? Support Cronin? That's just a disguise. I only got two orders, since the very beginning.
[name="Schwarz"]   First, Mr. Jacobs asked me to collect evidence against Cronin, including those about his secret manipulation of V3 Industries and unauthorized exploit of obsidian.
[name="Schwarz"]   Now that everything is clear, just cut the crap.
[Character(name="avg_npc_020")]
[name="Cronin's Man"]   Get-Get them! Both of them! Now!
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#4")]
[name="Schwarz"]   Second, you heard her.
[name="Schwarz"]   ... My lady asked me to protect her.
