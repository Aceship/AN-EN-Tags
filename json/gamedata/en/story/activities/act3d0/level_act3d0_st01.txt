[name="???"]   The data recorded by the monitoring station is here. Please check it.
[name="Female Voice"]   Just tell me the result.
[Image(image="ac3_report",screenadapt="coverall",x=0, y=0, xScale=1, yScale=1, fadetime=4)]
[name="???"]   They say the sample's temperature has not exceeded the highest record this year.
[name="???"]   And it's a bit far from the peak values in the past three years. And the steam is also normal.
[name="???"]   So...
[name="Female Voice"]   So?
[name="???"]   So the station estimates that nothing abnormal will happen to the volcano and your request for announcement has been turned down again. The Mayor also...

[name="Female Voice"]   You're kidding me!!
[name="Female Voice"]   My method may be simple, but apparently there's something wrong with the sample I have.
[name="Female Voice"]   The volcano was already dangerous last year!
[name="Female Voice"]   But they didn't send a warning or even make a news report! Nothing!!
[name="???"]   Miss Ceylon, pl-please calm down.
[name="???"]   Since the station says so, no one will trust us no matter what we do.
[Image(fadetime=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   ...Sorry.
[name="Ceylon"]   Can we really count on the station's data?
[name="???"]   To be honest, the City Council of Siesta doesn't pay much attention to this. Perhaps something's really wrong with the detector.
[name="Ceylon"]   In that case, the situation of the volcano will be covered up.
[name="???"]   So, what are you going to do?
[name="Ceylon"]   I can't explain this phenomenon with what I learned. If we can't get a correct report from the station, we gotta turn to someone else.
[stopmusic(fadetime=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   The status is not that bad now. We still have time. Is there a chance we find professionals from these tourists?
[name="Ceylon"]   I don't think we can find anyone, not to mention they can give a correct conclusion, but this is literally our last chance...
[name="Ceylon"]   Many tourists have already arrived in Siesta.
[name="Ceylon"]   After all, the Obsidian Festival is about to be held. It'll be too late if we don't do something now.

[name="Cronin"]   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Siesta.
[name="Cronin"]   We have beautiful mountains, water, sunshine and passionate citizens in Siesta.
[name="Cronin"]   Thanks to this perfect environment, Siesta can focus on making itself a perfect scenic spot and bringing you the best vacation experience.
[name="Broadcast"]    Speaking of the environment, the Siesta Volcano must be a hot topic. Many tourists may know little about volcano. Could you introduce it to everyone?
[name="Cronin"]   Sure. First of all, we don't have to worry about the volcano. Unlike the volcano you may know, it is not that mysterious or dangerous. The Siesta Volcano is our friend.
[name="Cronin"]   I can guarantee that as the Catastrophe Messenger. Please rest assured.
[name="Cronin"]   I think you all know the development of Siesta gives the credit to this volcano.
[name="Cronin"]   Do you remember the Catastrophe that almost hit Siesta? Thanks to the volcano's protection, we get to gather here and enjoy the festival today.
[name="Broadcast"]    By the way, Siesta also has another special feature: the obsidian. 
[name="Broadcast"]    People think it can keep Oripathy at bay, so it's popular these years.
[name="Cronin"]   Yes, and the small number of the Infected in Siesta is the best proof.
[name="Cronin"]   You may hear rumors out there, or some so-called scientific theory, but no matter what they say, the fact in Siesta is the best proof.
[name="Cronin"]   But it's a pity that the exploit of obsidian has been banned by the government as it can cause destruction to the volcano's environment.
[name="Cronin"]   But still the trade of obsidian is legal, so if you're interested in obsidian products, you can take a look at the market.
