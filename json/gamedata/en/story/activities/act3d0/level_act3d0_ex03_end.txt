[name="Bodyguard"]   But Mr. Emperor, you got a show later. There may be an accident...
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Accident?
[name="Emperor"]   You mean shooting, assassination, kidnapping and threatening suicide?
[name="Emperor"]   What can they stop? Me?
[name="Emperor"]   No, they only become part of my show, like how rhythm breaks the meaning of words. Do you understand?

[Character]
[name="Tourist with Strange Face"]   Don't blame me. Yes, it's all your fault. How many singers do you think have been sacrificed for your so-called rap empire...
[name="Tourist with Strange Face"]   Emperor? Fxxk yourself, you nasty penguin!
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Aha, let's me think about it. Who's playing those stupid tricks? Media, public voice, personal abuse, and shooting, huh?
[name="Emperor"]   You think I have no idea who you are after you go on a trip in the sewer and garbage? Does shooting those young people satisfies you, "singer"?
[Character]
[name="Tourist with Strange Face"]   What the—!
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   If I didn't happen to feel disgusted, how many more stars you don't like will be "eliminated"?

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1")]
