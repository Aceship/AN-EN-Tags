[name="Grani"]   But we can't afford to rest yet, Carol. Sorry...

[name="Carol"]   I'm fine... But, Mister Bob... what about him...?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#4",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   He might need some time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#4",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Need some time...? Are you saying...

[name="Carol"]   Sorry, I just tripped over this root...
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   Here, take my hand.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   ...Thank you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   Can you walk?

[name="Carol"]   ...I'm fine, it's just a bruise. As you said, it's best that we keep moving...
[name="Carol"]   Once we cross this forest, we'll reach the foot of Mt. Mortica. We need to find the second cave halfway up the mountain.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   We can only get in through the cave entrance?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Yeah. Once inside, we'll still have to follow some paths in the darkness, but I know the way. The treasure is hidden in the deepest part of the cave.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   Mhm. Well, in that case...

[name="Grani"]   Listen closely, there's the sound of screaming as well.
[name="Grani"]   Someone's fighting. It's not over yet.
[name="Grani"]   ...Carol, are you scared?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   I'm...
[name="Carol"]   ...Yes, I am.
[name="Carol"]   But in order to protect my village and return peace to these lands... I have to do this.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#4",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   I see...
[name="Grani"]   You're really brave.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#4",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   Don't worry about it. Anyway, let's keep moving.
