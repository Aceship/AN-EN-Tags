[name="Pepe", avatarId="bavg_npc_001", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]We have both halves of the disc. You are about to witness a piece of history that has been buried for a thousand years.
[decision(option1="What is it about?", value1="1.1")]
[predicate(references="1.1")]
[name="Pepe", avatarId="bavg_npc_001", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]The Shah...
[decision(option1="Shahanshah, the King of Kings... Lugalszargus.", value1="2.1")]
[predicate(references="2.1")]
[name="Pepe", avatarId="bavg_npc_001", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Yes, the Overlord of Ages. Even though he's long, long gone, some continue to obsess over his shadows.
[name="Pepe", avatarId="bavg_npc_001", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]His words and deeds that were never recorded in the history books, the items he left behind on his conquests...
[name="Pepe", avatarId="bavg_npc_001", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Over the past several years, I've visited the site of every legend of the Shah.
[name="Pepe", avatarId="bavg_npc_001", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]I wanted to pull back the curtain of history, to learn who the Shah truly was, behind the veil of the once and future king.
[decision(option1="Why didn't you tell us until now?", value1="3.1")]
[predicate(references="3.1")]
[name="Pepe", avatarId="bavg_npc_001", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Because there are others following in the Shah's footsteps, but their motives are far from pure.
[name="Pepe", avatarId="bavg_npc_001", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]The lords ameer only understand what they find in terms of treasures that symbolize authority, and turning them into glittering coins.
[name="Pepe", avatarId="bavg_npc_001", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]In most cases, though, their true value can't be measured in monetary terms.
[decision(option1="So what is it measured in?", value1="4.1")]
[predicate(references="4.1")]
[name="Pepe", avatarId="bavg_npc_001", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Curiosity... the easiest desire to satisfy. You seek nothing but a simple truth.
