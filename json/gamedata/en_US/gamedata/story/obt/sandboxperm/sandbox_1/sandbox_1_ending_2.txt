[name="Village Elder"]A second victory. With all your new companions, we're filled with hope here like never before.

[name="Tuye"]That was a great victory. I only hope they'll learn from their defeat and stop harassing us.

[name="Village Elder"]They have no shortage of money, yet they continue to invade the area year after year. What they are seeking must be very special.

[name="Eunectes"]So Arsalan really does have ruins and treasure?
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_472_pasngr_n_1",focus="m")]
[name="Passenger"]This place isn't called the Szubat-Arsalan for no reason. This is one of the areas where the Aslans first took up arms.
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_472_pasngr_n_1",focus="m")]
[name="Passenger"]It is hardly surprising there are thousand year-old ruins here.
