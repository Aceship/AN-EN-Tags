Through the sandy haze, you see the vague outlines of several enraged needleflies attacking some wobbly person.

[name="Village Elder"]Thank you for back the lost man, young ones. Had it not been for you, he could've spent his entire life wandering out there.
[name="Village Elder"]But this isn't exactly the promised land. What brings you here?
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_416_zumama_1",focus="m")]
[name="Eunectes"]We're looking to establish a branch office in the Szubat-Arsalan region, as well as a site for observing the Foehn Hotlands.
[charslot]
[name="Village Elder"]Szubat-Arsalan? That's a long-defunct name. But yes, this would be the place you people call Arsalan.
[name="Village Elder"]However, very few people ever mention the glorious name of the 'Lionpride's Ancient Throne'.
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_416_zumama_1",focus="m")]
[name="Eunectes"]What about now?
[charslot]
[name="Village Elder"]Now? It's exactly as you see.
[charslot]
[name="Village Elder"]We once lived along the shores of the Narotabati River to the south, but the Foehn Hotlands gradually cut off the river's flow, turning the coast into salt flats.
[charslot]
[name="Village Elder"]Our homeland was buried in a sandstorm, my predecessor lost his ameeri title, and conquest continued to eat away at his territory.
[charslot]
[name="Village Elder"]Our autonomy was supposed to be the last thing we had left, but in recent years, rumors started going around that Arsalan still hid a treasure of some sort, prompting the nearby lords ameer to return with their troops.
[charslot]
[name="Village Elder"]They pillaged and looted everywhere they went, forcing our people into their mining camps to the south, where many of them contracted deadly diseases. *sigh*...
[name="Village Elder"]We were forced to move north, and here we are.
[charslot]
[name="Village Elder"]There is no such thing as the 'Lionpride's Ancient Throne'. It is nothing more than a place where a bunch of refugees have gathered.
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_416_zumama_1#4",focus="m")]
[name="Eunectes"]Figures... So that's why so many Oripathy patients have been showing up around here.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_402_tuye_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Tuye"]On top of the fact that it's hard enough to stay alive in this place, it seems that the lords ameer spell serious trouble for our operational objective.
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_416_zumama_1#4",focus="m")]
[name="Eunectes"]There has to be a solution.
[charslot]
[name="Village Elder"]Let's set that aside. The location you marked isn't too far from us. It's in the vicinity of this part of the jungle and the oasis.
[name="Village Elder"]We won't get in the way of your work. If there's anything you need, come and find me.
