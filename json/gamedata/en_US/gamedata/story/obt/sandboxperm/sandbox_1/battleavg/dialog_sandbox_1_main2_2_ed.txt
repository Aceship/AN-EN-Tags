[name="Passenger", avatarId="char_472_pasngr", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]What happened here? Why the hostility to outsiders?
[name="Temple Priest", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Our clan has lived here in peace for many years, until the ameeri army invaded the oasis and burned the trees. Now nothing grows from the earth.
[name="Temple Priest", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]We kept retreating towards the edge of the oasis, seeking to escape their harassment. We finally found refuge in our ancestral temple.
[name="Temple Priest", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Last month, however, the statue outside the temple vanished mysteriously.
[name="Temple Priest", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]The statue has guarded the doors of the temple for centuries. It is of great importance to us.
[name="Passenger", avatarId="char_472_pasngr", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]Judging by the marks on the door, the statue must have been massive. It couldn't have been moved without alerting anyone.
[name="Passenger", avatarId="char_472_pasngr", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]And what use would someone have for the statue?
[name="Temple Priest", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Who knows? Those treasure seekers go after anything ancient.
[name="Temple Guard", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Yeah, the ameeri soldiers took my family's pickle pot. I didn't know what they were looking for.
[name="Temple Guard", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Until that mysterious Feline told me that it dated back to the time of the Shah.
[name="Passenger", avatarId="char_472_pasngr", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]The Shah...?

[name="Passenger", avatarId="char_472_pasngr", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]Please excuse me, I have some personal matters to attend to.
[name="Passenger", avatarId="char_472_pasngr", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]We part for now. I'll return before the next time you need me.
[name="Tuye", avatarId="char_402_tuye", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]We would like to ask some questions.
[name="Temple Priest", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Go ahead.
[name="Tuye", avatarId="char_402_tuye", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]What is the treasure the ameeri soldiers are looking for?
[name="Temple Priest", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]I don't know for certain, but I vaguely remember that when I was a child, I heard the elders mention that it could be priceless or worthless.
[name="Tuye", avatarId="char_402_tuye", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]What kind of a description is that?
[name="Temple Priest", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Perhaps the archaeologist who came a few days ago can offer a better answer. To my knowledge, most rumors of the treasure come from further north in the jungle.
