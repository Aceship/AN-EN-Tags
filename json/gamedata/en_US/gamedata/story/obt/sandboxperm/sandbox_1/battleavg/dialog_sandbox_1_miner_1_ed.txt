[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]You're really strong. Thank you.
[name="Tuye", avatarId="char_402_tuye", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]Only doing the right thing.
[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]In Arsalan, you're a decent person if you keep your word. These days, the lords ameer have made us stop believing in promises.
[name="Tuye", avatarId="char_402_tuye", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]Where are your leaders?
[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]All killed in battle. We once lived by the water, but when the Narotabati River dried up, some of us went to join the clans in the northern jungles.
[name="Manticore", avatarId="char_215_mantic", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]Not an unusual story in Sargon.
[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]The lords ameer came when I was little. They promised much and delivered nothing.
[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]My siblings and I were taken and made to work here. We tried to resist... but we failed.
[name="Tuye", avatarId="char_402_tuye", isAvatarRight="TRUE"]That's all in the past now. We've arranged for your siblings to join up with the northern tribes.
[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]There isn't much I can offer in gratitude, except some notes on digging from those who came before.
