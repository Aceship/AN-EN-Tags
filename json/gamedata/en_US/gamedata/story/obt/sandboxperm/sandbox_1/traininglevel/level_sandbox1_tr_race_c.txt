You may have noticed your Originium slug has slowed down after running out of Stamina.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_wyvern", black="$f_tut_black", protectTime=2)] \
When they run out of Stamina, they'll <@tu.kw>rest</> and crawl forward slowly while <@tu.kw>gradually regaining their Stamina</>.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_wyvern", black="$f_tut_black", protectTime=2)] \
They'll start to sprint again once their Stamina recovers to full. Their <@tu.kw>Endurance</> affects <@tu.kw>how fast they consume Stamina</> and their <@tu.kw>Stamina recovery speed</> as well.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_wyvern", black="$f_tut_black", protectTime=2)] \
Slugs may crash into other slugs or the race course. They will consume <@tu.kw>Stamina</> if they crash into the <@tu.kw>course</>.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_wyvern", black="$f_tut_black")] \
That's all I have to say. Let's try it for real now.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_wyvern", black="$f_tut_black")] \
If you need me to <@tu.kw>give you a run-down of the rules again</>, just come <@tu.kw>here</> and find me.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_wyvern", black="$f_tut_black")] \
Now then, I hope everyone has fun!
