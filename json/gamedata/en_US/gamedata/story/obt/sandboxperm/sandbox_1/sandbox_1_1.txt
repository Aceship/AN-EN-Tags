The girl gingerly wedges the two halves of the thick, heavy disc into the altar in the middle of the ancient witnessing chamber, every protrusion on its surface corresponding to a depression in the chassis.
After completing this placement, the girl gently pushes the disc counterclockwise in an almost effortless manner.
Even this tiny amount of force is enough to make the disc spin rapidly, the shaking of the ground from the disc's rotations palpable beneath your feet.

After many years of silence, this witnessing chamber is re-energized once more. Clear water gradually fills the pool, rays of light flow through crystalline stone, and the tremors beneath your feet become ever more evident.
Finally, the shaking stops, and the countless rays of light converge into the middle of the pool to sculpt a tall figure.

The man's figure fades away, the light and shadow shifting into a small canyon in the pool.
In what feels like only a few dozen seconds, the land rises and reforms, rivers change course, trees in the canyon grow and then wither rapidly, and everything warps beyond recognition through the erosion of time's passage.
