[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]We've established preliminary reconnaissance. I have a good grasp of the basic information and the ameeri army's movement. If you have any questions, ask away.

[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Szubat-Arsalan is roughly divided into five regions. To the west is the Rabum-Arakeeshtu Jungle, otherwise known as the Yellow-green Forest. It's rich in basic resources and has suitable ecological environments. It's a great place to start an exploration.
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]To the south is the Barren Salt Riverbank. From what I've heard, it has an abundance of stones, and it is connected to the jungle.
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]There seems to be an oasis to the east, and supposedly there are large iron deposits, but getting there is a problem.
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]As for the northwest, rumors say that the place is full of danger. Further investigation is needed before we know anything more.
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]We haven't started surveying the Circle of Gitmalutu to the north yet. The moment we learn anything new about it, I will share it with you.
