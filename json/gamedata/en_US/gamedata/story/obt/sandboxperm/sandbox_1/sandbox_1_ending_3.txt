After a fierce overnight battle, you see the enemies recede like the tide, exposing the barren dunes in the distance. Discarded weapons and shields dot the landscape, shimmering beneath the sun.

You let out a sigh of relief and sit down cross-legged. The sand-laced morning breeze brushes your face, quickly drying the sweat on your body. You feel a sense of comfort overtake you, and your head starts to bobble along with the wind.
Soon, the wind is also carrying little segments of your snores.

Through the camera lens, you see the confused expressions on everyone's faces. Everyone, except Passenger, who is wearing a slight smile on the corners of his lips.
Upon seeing his smile, the others become even more confused until they quickly realize why he is smiling.
