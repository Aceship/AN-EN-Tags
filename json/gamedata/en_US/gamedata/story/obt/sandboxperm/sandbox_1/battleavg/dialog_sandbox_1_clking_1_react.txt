[name="Treasure Hunter", avatarId="bavg_npc_003", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Thank you so much. I thought this was it for sure.
[decision(option1="What are you doing here?", value1="1.1")]
[predicate(references="1.1")]
[name="Treasure Hunter", avatarId="bavg_npc_003", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]It's a long story. I got word that there was treasure here a few months ago, but I wasn't the only one.
[decision(option1="The acrobat troupe?", value1="2.1")]
[predicate(references="2.1")]
[name="Treasure Hunter", avatarId="bavg_npc_003", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Band of thieves is more like it. Their performances are just a cover; what they're really after is the valuables carried by their audience members.
[decision(option1="We've crossed paths.", value1="3.1")]
[predicate(references="3.1")]
[decision(option1="They weren't so scary.", value1="4.1")]
[predicate(references="4.1")]
[name="Treasure Hunter", avatarId="bavg_npc_003", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Don't underestimate them. They have the a lord ameer's backing, and a stranglehold over this cave. They won't allow anyone to take the treasure.
[decision(option1="So they're involved here?", value1="5.1")]
[predicate(references="5.1")]
[decision(option1="What is this treasure, anyway?", value1="6.1")]
[predicate(references="6.1")]
[name="Treasure Hunter", avatarId="bavg_npc_003", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]That's the strange thing. No one knows.
[name="Treasure Hunter", avatarId="bavg_npc_003", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Oh no... they're back...
[name="Acrobat", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Bold, aren't you? Trespassing on my land.
[name="Acrobat", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]And you even want to leave with the woman. Not so fast. Lock them up, boys!
[name="Acrobat", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]You can rot in this cell.
[name="Acrobat Assistant", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"](Whisper) Boss... perhaps...
[name="Acrobat Assistant", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"](Whisper) The boys can't... but maybe they can...
[name="Acrobat", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]You've got a point.
[name="Acrobat", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Alright, listen up. You want to live, you'll bring me the gems from a pair of Gemini Gembeasts.
[name="Acrobat", avatarId="bavg_enemy_common", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]It's that, or her head.
[name="Treasure Hunter", avatarId="bavg_npc_003", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Wait!
[decision(option1="We accept.", value1="7.1")]
[predicate(references="7.1")]
[name="Treasure Hunter", avatarId="bavg_npc_003", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]You... you don't know what you just got yourself into...
