[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]All I know is that there's a priestess there you shouldn't mess with. The terrain is treacherous with a lot of swamps.
[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]I suggest you go during dry seasons, when the swamps dry up.
[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]If you insist on going at other times, you should be prepared to fight in the water.

[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]I'm not too familiar with the area, but legends say it's a land of lava and fire.
[name="Kestrel", avatarId="char_4023_rfalcn", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]It would be easier to navigate the region during the rainy season.
