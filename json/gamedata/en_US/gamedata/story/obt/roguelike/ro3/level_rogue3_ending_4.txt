This is a land of yellow sand never mapped out by scholars before the King of Kings.
A land where creatures are blown aside, gold and iron alike melt, and even gravel is ground to nothingness.
Time returns to chaos, time shall no longer be measured through life and death, time is boundless.

There exists only the sound of horns and the roar of wild beasts. Two gargantuan armies that never stop charging towards one another, spanning as far as the blurry horizon and as near as beneath one's very nose.
This is a war that may have been started by the observation and thoughts of the expeditioners. A war that may have no end because it also has no beginning.
The expeditioners recognize this place.

Kharanduu Khagan tramples the land, denying that his Khaganquest would meet any obstacles or come to any end.
Lugalszargus decrees life and death as if there is neither dawn nor dusk in the dust of the battlefield, because he still holds time itself in the palm of his hand.
The dominion of these ancient heroes extends over all.
Those who enter by mistake forever become the vassals of their conquest, never to return.
––The foehn hotlands.
The war between the King of Kings and the Nightzmora Khagan left this land of death in the southernmost part of Terra.
The footsteps of the expeditioners are no different from the intruders who have been incinerated by the scorching winds for millennia – nothing more than puffs of smoke in this lifeless domain.
The expeditioners do everything they can to avoid being blown away.
Their temporary defensive basecamp is crumbling, the team members resorting to a variety of palliative measures to adjust their bodily functions, barely clinging on to life in the overwhelming heat.
In their fear, the people look up to the heroes who seek an endpoint for their great works.
Freed from the restraints of constancy, time itself dilates and stretches. Finally, the megastructure reactivates, stars emerge from the yellow sand, and the expeditioners dash towards the gate in a mad panic.
'The megastructure's running really unstably.'
'The spatial stabilization device is damaged... it won't stay open for long... If you can hear me, get out of there.'

The moment she steps back through the fractured gate, Magallan, the member at the tail end of the team, turns back to look at the battlefield one last time.
Her lungs breathe in the fear, her skin still senses the heat.
Then, she recalls the annihilation that they faced when they first arrived at the terminus of the endless icefields all those years ago, as well as the melting snow that fell on her.
She understands what the last great deed of these two great rulers was.
The terrible energy that had turned rainforest into desert did not result from a clash between them. Rather, they had driven enemies similar to Crazelyseon back through the ring.
The results from the initial activation of the megastructure were incredibly gratifying. For the first time, humanity gained information on the foehn hotlands, and were able to clearly glimpse into a period of history from thousands of years ago–
The heroes who waged war against eternity were also the same humans who set out into the barrenlands in pursuit of the unknown.
Now, the gate is wide open.
There are no longer limits to where people may reach.
The expeditioners' horizons have expanded into distant pasts once unimaginable.
And now, they will move towards a distant future with an equally unpredictable fate.
