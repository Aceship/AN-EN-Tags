Through trials and tribulations, through trial and error.
The survey team arrived here under the Cyclops's guidance, here at end of the endless icefields, in the north beyond the north.
The inscrutable object stands tall, its base covered in rootless flowers.
The explorers who made it this far are no strangers to fear, and fear is what now spreads through everyone's minds.
Somehow, they all know that if the door could be opened, that a dark fate awaits beyond.
But the Cyclops has already begun walking towards it.
She has been walking towards it ever since the day she emerged from her cave.
Her vision starts to warp. Perception and understanding are causing space to collapse rapidly.
Knowledge from the rift begins to encroach upon reality. Those who wish to stop the coming of the ill fate could not make a sound in the interfered fear.

Like all the others, Typhon gazes at the figure.
Unlike the others, Typhon has seen her embark on her date with fate many times.
The Cyclops never explains where she is going. Simply follow the guidance of the fate she speaks of, and they would meet again someday.
But this time, Typhon feels compelled to call out to her, to stop her.
Not because of a premonition of calamity, nor out of fear of the unknown. The hunter astutely grasps her concrete apprehension.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#1$1")]

The Cyclops hears the call and turns around.
The great ring begins to spin, reflecting darkness bright as the starry sky, brilliant colors meandering.
A collapse is occurring, one that far exceeds all recorded instances.
She has seen it all in her foresight.
One glance into the abyss will bring unprecedented disasters to Sami, and indeed to all of Terra.
The prophesized moment did not tell her how long she can hold it off, nor how much anger and hatred would be directed at her in the days to come.
She knows only one thing about her destiny.
In the great shadow of the demon, the Cyclops raises a black veil of Arts, separating the disaster she caused from the others.
[name="Arges"]Go.
Typhon knew what she was going to say. The Cyclops, who had always carried sorrow on her face, is smiling.
'This is my fate.'
[name="Arges"]My daughter, whose fate I do not know...
[name="Arges"]May you live in freedom.

No!

[PlayMusic(intro="$newhope01_intro", key="$newhope01_loop", volume=0.7)]
A single figure dashes forward in the endless darkness.
Breaking free of the quagmire of fear, casting away her heavy bow and arrows.
Typhon tries to grab the figure walking forward alone.
She stretches her hand out in desperation.
A hornbeast of pristine silvery white leaps past her lithely.
It is light as snow, too light to touch, even by a dreamcatcher made of spider silk.
It is the alabaster mercy of the Sami, that all Sami have seen in dream.

Like the aurora, its brilliance tears the darkness apart and soars into the sky.
Sami's Sovereign of Beasts charges into the demon before It.
A great flash explodes towards the warped visible space, its rays scattering in silence and disappearing into the unfathomable void.
The silver frost from the hornbeast fades away with the terrifying stars in the shockwave.
The energy annihilation causes the ice crystals to sublime.
Droplets of hot water fall on the end of the icefield.

The demonic shadow fades away, and the silvery white hornbeast is gone.
The eldritch colors from the ring are gone, leaving only ancient silver-white on the ice.
All present look up at all this in a daze. Finally, a researcher breaks the silence with their footsteps.
The researchers begin to survey the great ring, but never find a way to activate it, nor any gaps that they could traverse.
Typhon searches the ground nearby.
She is looking for a solid snowball with the mark of a beast's horn.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#4$1")]
[name="Typhon"]...I can't find it.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_969_1#1$1")]
She could not accept that the great hornbeast has departed, its return uncertain, but Arges shakes her head.
[charslot]
Its footprints disappear in the never-ending snowfall.
The two Sarkaz who do not belong to the Sami Elafia whisper their gratitude to the love of Sami.
The storm seems to have passed.
But the prophesized fate has yet to come to pass.
Much like her destined deathâ€”
The door will be truly opened, one day.
