[name="Magallan"]*ahem* Um. Scientific explorer Magallan, starting audio log.

[name="Magallan"]It has been twelve days since the joint expedition team entered Sami.

The tundra, the Myrkwood, the smell of wood and moss, the weight of fresh snow, the temperature of the wind, the cries of the hornbeasts.
The buzz of data recording, the heat emanating from the survival equipment, the marks left by trekking poles, the hum of drones taking flight.
The expedition team explores the strange land.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#9$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Our journey so far has been pretty smooth sailing, thanks to our two wonderful friends from Sami!

[name="Magallan"]Typhon, would you like to say a word or two?

[name="Typhon"]Simone's also busy setting up some exorcising stuff. And she's tracking down some Ursus thing anyway.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#8$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Ehehe. Okay.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#8$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Anyway, we would be lost in the forest right now if not for their assistance!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#8$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Also... We're about to meet someone who's said to be a pretty reliable prophet.

Magallan raises her head as she holds up the audio recorder.
A tall figure is barely visible in the fog in front of them.
The doom-seeing Sarkaz Cyclops is waiting to show them the way.
Careful consideration and calculation no longer hold meaning. The explorers step onto solid earth, casting their gazes towards the vast unknown.
They fumble around for the fate awaiting them right in front of their noses.
