The old castle stands amidst the forest.
The place is in just the perfect state of disrepair.
The Troupe sets up camp here.
They build a set for their performance.
Their years of operation are met with success.
Yet there remains unanswered questions.
Where is the lead performer?
Where is the main character?
Silence, silence. No one can give the answer.

Who the lead performer is is naturally obvious.
The main character need not identify themselves.
Step onto the stage.
The Troupe's new star. The Troupe's blood diamond.
