And so, the story has reached its conclusion.
The lights turn off, the actors leave the stage, and the red curtains are slowly drawn.
The crowd has dissipated, and everything has once again returned to silence.

Phantom has regained his self.
He yet remembers everything that he has done.
He understands that, as the lead actor, he is merely the troupe's bait.
One after another, he lured many earnest, upright men to this trap from which they can never escape.
A perilous journey where words are unnecessary.
Now, he is rescued, but what about before?
How many men have lost their way in this towering labyrinth?
Has he ever pushed his companions off the stage when they offered him a helping hand?
He dares not to imagine.
He feels nothing but shame.

[name="Shalem"]You gave Rhodes Island quite a bit of trouble this time. You'd do well to think ahead of time what to tell the Doctor.

[name="Shalem"]Come to think of it. This place feels familiar.
