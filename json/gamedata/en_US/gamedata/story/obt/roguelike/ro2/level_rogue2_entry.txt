Someone once posed this question to Mizuki:
'How do you become a better human?'
[dialog]
[delay(time=1)]

Now, he has grown up.

As he grew older, Mizuki gained new viewpoints and perspectives throughout his life, instilling him with the confidence to now answer this question.

heeding the guidance of the wind, the tides, and we many.
He arrives at the residence of the old bishop.
