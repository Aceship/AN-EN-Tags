Since the birth of the new world, this was the first conflict between the 'Firstborn.'
Mizuki became the consciousness the 'Creeping Branch' had lost, and used this new power to challenge the 'Corrupting Heart.'
We many awaited the outcome of this conflict.
[dialog]
[delay(time=1)]
Ishar'mla is defeated.
He loses his 'Firstborn' status, and becomes yet another nameless entity within we many.
Mizuki has emerged victorious, yet He feels no joy at this victory.
Right before His eyes, another 'Firstborn' teeters on the brink of madness.
The treacherous ruse of the Bishops of the Deep has been brought to light: they would drive the 'Primordial Lifespring,' the source of the Profound Silence, to madness, and thus induce the awakening of the 'Corrupting Heart' within Skadi.
Once the two 'Firstborn' fused, it would trigger a mass extinction-level Silence, ushering in the destruction of Ægir and the era of the Seaborn long-desired by the Bishops.
This 'Firstborn' is not like Ishar'mla. It is the symbol of the Seaborn's survival, the bioenrichment of microorganisms.
It is one with the ocean, and there is no way to defeat It unless the ocean dries up.
Unless...
[dialog]
[delay(time=1)]
The ocean turns blood red, and the Silence's arrival is imminent.
Even should the Lifespring's madness be quelled, even if we many is given a leader,
None of that would halt the drive to survive and evolve engrained into their genes.
Of course, Mizuki is able to keep we many from the land,
But with the awakening of the Seaborns' instincts and we many's consciousness,
His control will eventually collapse.
After a decade? Or perhaps a generation?
Even He cannot say for sure.
All He can do is uphold the agreement with the Doctor - until both His ego and humanity complete their retreat.
At least... the Doctor and friends must be protected from Seaborn encroachment for however much time remains.
The tide is about to rise, and Mizuki has no other choice.

He steps into the ocean.
His body undergoes a metamorphosis as He takes the same form as the Lifespring so that He may soothe the madness of His kin.
From bright crimson diffuses deep cerulean.
And Mizuki's human form gradually disappears.
At the final moment, He turns His head to gaze back towards the land, a person's figure reflected in His eyes.
In the next moment, the tide surges.
Thus recedes Mizuki's image, never to be seen again.
......
Cerulean blots out crimson, and the 'Firstborn's' madness is soothed.
The Seaborn and Sea Terrors swim towards the ocean's depths, leaving the land to its original inhabitants.
Humanity cheers, celebrating this historic change.
But what they do not know is––
Everything comes at a price.
A pharmaceutical company has forever lost a trusted companion.
