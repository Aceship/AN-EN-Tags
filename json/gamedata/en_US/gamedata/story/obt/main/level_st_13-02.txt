[name="Nowell"]Please, rest assured I hold no ill intent towards you all. I only wish to find... the 'hands of fate' that cursed me.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]She hides behind the country, treating her monarch as her glove, and the city-state her chessboard.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]She merely looks upon everything labeled 'Victoria' with a cold gaze. If needed, 'Victoria' can even be destroyed and rebuilt, and topped off with a new flag after.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]How can I believe she isn't involved in our current turmoil of absurdity?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]She's definitely hiding within the dukes. Watching the Sarkaz and Victorians engage in mutual slaughter. Bloodshed and sacrifice are merely heartless parameters and indicators to her.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]Perhaps you might have been manipulated by a similar pair of 'hands' before—you have royal blood running through your veins after all. She has no reason to let you nor Alistair's daughter go.
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_011_talula_1#3",focus="m")]
[name="Talulah"]Me? I do know another conspirator, but he doesn't deserve to be called a god, nor can he manipulate my fate.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]But that's exactly how they live on, Talulah.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]I want to know how to kill them.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]Or perhaps, how to kill myself.
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_011_talula_1#3",focus="m")]
[name="Talulah"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]It's getting late, I need to fix little Susanna's glasses.
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_011_talula_1#3",focus="m")]
[name="Talulah"]Mr. Nowell, you...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]Talulah. The reason why I willingly tell you all of this, and why I joined Reunion—do forgive my selfishness—it is due to the intuition I've honed by the extra century I've lived.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]You too, have resisted such a predetermined fate.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1066_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nowell"]All of you here have.
