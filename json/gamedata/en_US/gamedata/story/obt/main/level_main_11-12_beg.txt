[name="Theresis"]Time goes by fast for your race and your country, compared to the Sarkaz.
[name="Theresis"]Not long after the titan that was Gaul collapsed, Victoria and Leithanien feasted on its remnants as quickly and ferociously as they could. It has only been a few dozen years, and the Gallic Era has long since come and gone.
[name="Theresis"]You never witnessed Corsica I's battleships and cannons. You have never knew Lingones's prosperity and pride. The lands of your father's generation have been integrated into the territories of Victoria's most provincial nobles.
[name="Theresis"]The uniform you wear is that of a high-ranking Victorian officer. The medals you wear are all Victorian.
[name="Theresis"]You speak the most standard Victorian as the Londinier nobility do, without even the slightest hint of Gaulish accent.

[Character(name="avg_npc_649_1#1$1")]
[name="Lt. Colonel Lettou"]Victoria was in that war against Kazdel, too. And from what I heard, the reason you and the Military Commission were able to enter Londinium was precisely because of an invitation from Duke Cavendish.

[name="Lt. Colonel Lettou"]I'm sure you know this better than me. The other dukes are all paying keen attention to Londinium's situation right now. No matter what you are planning to do within the city, you will need a new helping hand.
