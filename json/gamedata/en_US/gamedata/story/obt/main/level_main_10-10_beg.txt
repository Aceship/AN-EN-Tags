[character(name="avg_npc_404_1#6$1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_419_1#1$1")]

[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]But he used to work for Babel!
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]It was the mercenaries under his watch that screwed up, and it was his old friend that incited them! Don't you think it's too risky to keep him in such a key position, General?

[name="Manfred"]We've had everything stolen from us, been forced to grow accustomed to fighting each other for the right to survive.
[name="Manfred"]And now, we've obtained a new opportunity.
[name="Manfred"]You tell me, do you want to go back to monitoring a possible Sarkaz spy, or will you accompany me in eliminating the remaining Victorian threats?
