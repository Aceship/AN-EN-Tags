This is an eternal journey. One that promises to never end.
The myriad souls have long since fallen into silence, their forms nearly worn away by the ravages of time.
Only their King still moves forward. For the sake of them all.
Theresa has no intention of stopping.
She had travelled to the depths of Civilight Eterna several times in the past. But this time, her wanderings are slightly different. She no longer stops to draw from the vast sea of knowledge within.
She is merely here to see.
To use her own eyes for one last time, to see the peoples and affairs of the lands.
To see what happens, or perhaps what has not yet happened.

A horn resounds across the icefield.
It is a signal from the expedition, and also a way to greet others across great distances.
Perhaps this Cyclops will not return to Kazdel, for this frozen land is already her home.

She looks at the wondrous pattern inscribed upon the wood given to her by the Snowpriest.
'Aexlun'.
Flora and fauna, flourish and fall...
