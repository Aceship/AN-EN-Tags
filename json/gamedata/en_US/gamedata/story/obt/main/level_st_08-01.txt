Law, original law, had behind it, in synonymous form with vengeance, the same original need—the need for violence.
City-states made pledges to their people, and used sumptuous lives and stable surroundings to appease them—
To let their lifespans serve one man-made purpose, to tame their innate will to subjugate, to teach them to be at ease, to lead them to be weak.
Our Majesty is sage, perceptive.
A great many city-states will treat strength as a crime, will take deficient courage as a virtue, will regard fear of death as progress. Our Majesty will tear their last semblances from them, make them reflect, make them search themselves.
We, as a human race, have always had a kind of thirst flowing through our blood vessels; a thirst to loose our own life force by our actions.

Fairness is not by nature. Fairness is dependent on having the wisdom, the force of will to create it.
Our Majesty intends to recover all they need, all this the cities took away, and give it back to them.
New purpose will be declared. Our Majesty will rebuild their thought worn flat by daily life and boredom, and rouse the sanguine courage within them bound by deadened ethics for too long.
Violence runs our bodies through and through. If we don't allow it to germinate within ourselves, we will become resentful, insignificant and numb, and thus will incur our own destruction.
Those who fear habitually are despicable.
If one wants to be alive, they ought to be immersed in the heart of violence, see clearly how so much of ethics is a sham, understand the barren of our present world.
Only violence is real, able to be felt.

Not punishment, not rule, not the weighing of values and the decorum of appeasement. We will use our fists and weapons to tell them that we are alive, and that we ought to be alive. The right to life is reserved for the living.
I do not blame Our Majesty the Emperor for the punishment handed down on me. I showed contempt, ignorant of the times, for how he spoke all on his benevolent mind to the masses, for he was loathe for his people to all too quickly suffer the pain of violent change.
Even so, I cannot cease to tell the candid truth. I must constantly, continually praise Our Majesty's most profound insight. I can only shout my honesty. I cannot be silent.
The reality is, we do not want whatever justice, nor do we expect peace.

Only the shortsighted, rushing about their own interests, can wallow in peace.
What we want is to put to use the violence that surges in our veins, the nature of us aroused by the dawn of our own civilization, the origin of our dauntless struggle and victory. We want to make use of violence.
Dress it up any way to make our needs seem sensible, but that is irrelevant.
Should we need, we should seek directly. Leave the dressing up to the historians and the champions of morals. They only need justification, while our survival is more justified than any theory.
We want to injure people, defeat people, destroy people, and if Ursus reckons this disaster, then we should bring disaster to others, to people beyond Ursus.
If they do not stand strong, they should be eliminated. Some are fitter to survive than others, and fitter to succeed.
Weakness is evil. Strength is sublime. Our laws should be founded on the needs of the city's soundest. Our country should not serve the maggots, let alone nurture the innumerous ill.
May those I despise, those narrow-minded leisure-seeking subjects, be tried and found forever in the lake of blood. May Our Majesty lead Ursus to eternal prosperity.
