[name="Harmonie"]Our forces have taken over every last part of County Hillock, save a few small pockets.
[name="Harmonie"]The barracks didn't realize our true strength until it was too late, just as planned.
[name="Harmonie"]Did you see the looks on their faces? A force they thought to have been wiped out, and suddenly it reappeared. Like they were seeing actual ghosts.
[name="Harmonie"]Their greatest failure coming right as they were celebrating their victories. Not many Victorians left with any fight in them.
[name="Harmonie"]Grr. I almost forgot. My dear classmates are still struggling about in the outskirts.
[name="Harmonie"]Pitiful, pitiful. Their last ditch effort isn't going to change anything, and even if we don't so much as lift a finger, they've long been on their last legs, exhausted by the corruption of the military.
[name="Harmonie"]Mandragora's off looking for them. She's plenty enough to deal with the issue.

[name="Harmonie"]If death is inevitable, and order will always collapse no matter how many times it is rebuilt, then how do those who walk this journey bear with these pointless decisions again and again?
[name="Harmonie"]And you... you reached your hand out to me.

[name="Harmonie"]To make the Tarans' voices heard? Do you really believe that? Neither you nor I have an ounce of anything to do with Tara.
[name="Harmonie"]To take over County Hillock? Only an arrogant clown would believe that. Victoria may stand on shaky, even precarious ground, but any of the dukes' armies could easily reduce a nomadic city to ashes.
[name="Harmonie"]All we need to do is make sure the fire burns, so that all of Victoria will turn their eyes to it.
[name="Harmonie"]And in the fire, some of them will have seen only profit, some will have made known their hatred, and yet some will have found faith. In a way, this is quite the happy ending, wouldn't you agree?
[name="Harmonie"]Let's go. We still have one last thing to take care of.
[name="Harmonie"]Once we finish with that, it'll be time for us to leave. The traitors who continue to about on the stage are far more despicable than any clown.
[name="Harmonie"]Before it's time for us to step into the limelight again, we should climb back into the graves that Victoria was kind enough to dig for us. Such is the spectre force—Wouldn't you agree, Hill?

[name="Mandragora"]Hmph. Got me wondering now if this is some suicide attempt.
[name="Mandragora"]Thanks to my men, I'm thinking you don't have much ammo left. If you keep shelling like that, you'll have nothing left to fight with. Then you'll just have to sit and wait as your death comes.
[name="Mandragora"]To think Harmonie kept telling me over and over how impressive you were.
[name="Mandragora"]'Oh, they're the true face of the Victorian Army...' Hah. Look at you. Helpless, nowhere to go. Is that all a Royal Guard Academy distinction has to give?

[name="Mandragora"]It's people like you I hate.
[name="Mandragora"]You have a decent family background, and you think that gives you the right to trample us lot under your feet—

[name="Mandragora"]Our forces have taken over County Hillock. Yours are dead or shackled.

[name="Mandragora"]You're pretty good, I'll give you that. Very precise control over your weapon. You're trying to adjust your firing angle to pick out any openings in my Arts.
