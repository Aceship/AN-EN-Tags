[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]But what was the reality?
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]What kind of people has the Black Crown chosen?
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]In the beginning, the King of Sarkaz was indeed magnificent, the Diαblos walked the path of punishment, the Goliaths roared the fearless calamity—
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]But they found themselves betrayed by the cowardly, sold out by the selfish.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]This is our curse.

[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]The vile always prevail.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]As such, the Crown was besmirched by shortsighted fools.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]The weak began to appear among the Kings.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]They were narrow-minded, focused on toying with the power the held in their hands—They became no better than the hypocritical lords among the Elders and Ancients.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]The power they stole from others clouded their vision. The focus of my people's faith turned from fearless warriors to vermin hiding in their palaces.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_410_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]They even forgot the shame borne by the name 'Sarkaz'!
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]But the Crown continued to make its laughable choices, right up to my brother.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]I thought surely he would be the hero we had waited for!
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]He, on the other hand, had the audacity to say to me that the Sarkaz could no longer afford to continue to war, that it would take generations to rebuild Kazdel...
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]Even the skeleton beneath our feet knows that the Kazdel we should rebuild was never meant to be a city. And that the 'King of Sarkaz' should be the one to stand before them all.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]How can a man like that deserve to hold a single drop of Teekaz blood within his body?!

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_410_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]I remember it like it was yesterday. My hand pierced his chest. The limpid Teekaz blood danced on my fingertip, finally entering my veins.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]He turned his head to look at me, grabbing my clothes... The 'King of Sarkaz' showed his illusory vision to his murderer before he died, the vision that should have been bestowed as an honor.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]In the vision, I saw... I witnessed, <i>peace.</i>
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]As you said, Cautus, blood is not synonymous with death. I stood in the valley, watching a quiet village, a doctor laughing as he spoke, stitching up wounds for the injured.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]An injured man tells the doctor that his quarry was particularly ferocious, but he eventually won out. In the courtyard hangs the freshly harvested beastmeat.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]...And the doctor is me.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]But this makes me uncontrollably angry.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_410_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]How tragic, how meaningless, how shameful! My brother actually believed that this false 'peace' could deceive me? He was horrifically wrong!
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]He thought I was blinded by hatred? No, I know what peace is. And that's exactly why I feel so restless!
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]We long to see the great and powerful, true Teekaz!
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]I absorbed my brother's blood into my body, and I watched as the Black Crown vanished before my eyes—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1072_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Logos"]But you did not ascend to the throne of the 'King of Sarkaz'.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_410_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]And I do not regret that. If it could choose a formidable leader, I would be genuinely delighted.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]But this Crown disappoints me time and time again. Each time I am more disappointed.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]My brother's successor was a wandering vagrant. The next was a lumberjack. If it weren't for the records kept by the Confessarii, these people would not be remembered at all.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]Later, a King who ruled Kazdel was killed by the monster called Kal'tsit in the sight of the coalition army.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]Then came Theresa and Theresis.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]They were impressive, but also frustrating. Theresa, immersed in her fantasies, wasted her strength, much like my... weak elder brother.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]And her successor... turned out to be a Cautus, an outblood.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_410_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]Things being what they are, the Crown's choices being so absurd, even as its existence brings such humiliating hope to my people—
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]I would rather bury it beyond the reach of civilization. I will let it be truly lost, forgotten to history.
