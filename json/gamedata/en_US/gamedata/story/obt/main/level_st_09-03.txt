[name="Kal'tsit"]There hasn't been an emergency transmission to Rhodes Island's deck for eleven months and twenty-seven days, since the end of the Chernobog incident.

[character(name="avg_npc_235")]

[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]......
[name="Kal'tsit"]Right. I see you holding her revolver's cylinder.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I don't want to admit it, but I already knew the answer. I figured it out on our way here.

[name="Kal'tsit"]And it looks like she won.

[character(name="avg_npc_235")]
[name="Misery"]You're telling me to forget about avenging Outcast?
[name="Misery"]Don't worry. I'm angry and hurt, but I know my job.
[name="Misery"]It's just... I need to see for myself what it was that killed Outcast—
[name="Misery"]It couldn't have been just one person, or even several of them.
[name="Misery"]Suppose we don't go looking for the truth. The darkness shrouding Londinium, and even all of Victoria, is only going to get worse.
[name="Misery"]And at that point, it won't just be Outcast...
[name="Misery"]I'll die. We all will. No one will be safe.
[name="Misery"]Just like you said, Rhodes Island isn't about avenging the dead...
[name="Misery"]But I am sure we all want to let the living live.

[name="Saileach"]I'm sorry about this, Amiya... You're so busy, I shouldn't have you cut into your work to come see me. When I did my physical the other day, I heard you only got about five hours off a day...
[name="Amiya"]Folinic's always so worried about my health. Don't worry, though. I'm in excellent shape, and I've actually wanted to see you again for some time.
[name="Saileach"]So this used to be Outcast's office...?
[name="Amiya"]Yes, but she didn't get a lot of use out of it. We only just convinced her to accept a title change two months before the incident.
[name="Saileach"]She told me she was essentially half-retired before she came to County Hillock...
[name="Amiya"]But she still insisted on taking the mission.
[name="Saileach"]I often think back to everything she told me in those few days... I think she had probably made up her mind, already, to take on everything.
[name="Amiya"]That's just like her.
[name="Amiya"]All our elite operators are pretty eccentric, but Outcast's particularly special—She makes the kinds of difficult decisions that others would have a hard time with.
[name="Saileach"]Right, she told me... she gave up a really high position in the church because she failed to mediate peace in a war.
[name="Amiya"]Hmm... I know she left the church, but a failed mediation?
[name="Amiya"]I don't remember seeing that in her file. Actually, that sounds more like something that happened to Misery.
[name="Saileach"]......
[name="Saileach"]Ha... haha... I don't know why, but taking someone else's story sounds like something she'd do.
[name="Amiya"]This may be why some people found Outcast a little insincere...
[name="Saileach"]No, even if you tell me not everything she said was the truth, she's still the most sincere person I've ever met.
[name="Amiya"]You really think so? Hmm... I'm not too surprised. Outcast's always had an eye for people.
[name="Saileach"]I know your time is precious... but would you mind telling me more about her?
[name="Amiya"]I don't mind at all.
[name="Amiya"]This is going to take some time, though—
[name="Saileach"]As long as you have time. I'll always be willing to listen.
[name="Amiya"]Okay. I think... we'll have lots of time on our way to Londinium.

[character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"]—The point is, you heard it yourself.
[name="Ch'en"]The County Hillock Incident's a military drill gone wrong. That's what they told the public.
[name="Ch'en"]Everyone who's hurt or sick will receive compensation and be resettled. According to government documents, anyway.
[name="Ch'en"]If Dublinn, or the spectre force, had taken over County Hillock when you left, then they've long since left the place without a trace.

[character(name="avg_222_bpipe_1#8")]
[name="Bagpipe"]I agree.
[character(name="avg_222_bpipe_1#7")]
[name="Bagpipe"]But I still remember everythin' I saw there. No matter how peaceful their things might seem, County Hillock... and the cities around it have gone through a great change.
[name="Bagpipe"]Besides... isn't it all the more scary, when you think about how those changes are so well hidden in plain sight?
[character(name="avg_222_bpipe_1#5")]

[name="Regent"]Have they arrived?
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]Soon, Your Majesty. The Nachzehrer King and the Vampires' Prince of Blood will arrive in Londinium in three days.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062")]
[name="Regent"]With the court reassembled, the Sarkaz have not been so close to reunification since before the civil war.
[name="Regent"]We mustn't let any other factions get in the way.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]Speaking of other factions, Your Majesty, the envoy from County Hillock is still in Londinium.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062")]
[name="Regent"]We've already reached a conclusion on that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]It's just as you said, Your Majesty. They don't truly wish to form an alliance.
[name="Confessarius"]Had they such a motive, they wouldn't send a lunatic of a servant in their place as they hide whole behind the curtain.
[name="Confessarius"]There is no chance she lays hands on what she wants, but that is not why she left. The force she brought with her has been involved in multiple skirmishes with noble remnants and local residents in Londinium's outskirts.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062")]
[name="Regent"]They're probing the situation in Londinium, as well as evaluating our strength.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]Yes, Your Majesty. If we appear weak, the powers behind her will step onto the stage sooner.
[name="Confessarius"]Yet if we take a strong approach, she will lose her value as a pawn, and face a hasty disposal.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062")]
[name="Regent"]All those who would wield the blade that is the Sarkaz will find themselves slain by that very blade.
[name="Regent"]She is not even in the same class as Talulah.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]They may come from similar bloodlines, but Dublinn's leader and Talulah are nothing alike.
[name="Confessarius"]Compared to Reunion, the troubles that Dublinn stirs in the south have more than proven their strength. And it proves they are either ready to or are preparing to rip Victoria apart.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062")]
[name="Regent"]If one seeks to kick a man when he's down, one will only appear at the climax of the chaos.
[name="Regent"]At this stage, so long as the objective before us has nothing to do with the Sarkaz, no matter what they are scheming outside, they are unworthy of my attention.
[name="Regent"]But I will not allow any more chaos in Londinium.
[name="Regent"]Have Manfred do something about this. Dealing with the nobles is far too simple a task for him. He needs growth, and he needs it fast.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]Manfred has always known how you feel. He's made the preparations.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062")]
[name="Regent"]Still not enough. Any movement from Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]For the past few months, their usual, so-called 'commercial activities' have proceeded apace.
[name="Confessarius"]Ever since their landship sailed off from Kazimierz late last year, they've come close to Victoria several times. Since then, they've scarcely left our watchful eyes, and never for long.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062")]
[name="Regent"]As soon as they near Londinium... No, as soon as the few of them enter Victoria, report to me at once.
[name="Regent"]Or perhaps you may report to her directly.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]Of course, Your Majesty—The King of Sarkaz knows how to reclaim her promised crown.
