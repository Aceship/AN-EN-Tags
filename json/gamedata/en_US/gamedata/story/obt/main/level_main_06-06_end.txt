[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  He stopped crying.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  His eyes... it's like he's braindead.
[name="Reunion Member"]  I don't care about him. I miss Faust. He saved my life. He was a good commander.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=2)]
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Faust gave Mephisto to us... It was his last order. We're going to carry it out.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  None of my business.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=2)]
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Get out of the city with us and you have a better shot at survival.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  ...Okay. Let's go.
[name="Reunion Member"]  Where are you taking him?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=2)]
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Faust said he doesn't want us to take him back to Chernobog.
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  ...So where can he go?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  How long were you with Faust?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=2)]
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Um... At first, I'd say he was with us.
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Four or five years ago, Faust couldn't use any tactics and he really couldn't shoot a crossbow. We taught him all that.
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  He studied hard, trained harder, compared notes with the Yetis, sparred with Patriot's boys, and got stronger and stronger...
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Patriot and FrostNova both taught him. He became our leader, even though we never much called him that, it's what he was.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  You lucked out.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=2)]
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  No matter how Mephisto got, Faust never made us do anything.
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Archers, don't save your high-explosive bolts.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  Won't those bolts be useful against the L. G. D.?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=2)]
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Faust insisted we honor the dead like this.
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  "It's not a waste to show respect."

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  If I recall correctly, he was the crossbowman with Mephisto, and one of Reunion's commanders.
[name="Amiya"]  ...You knew him?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4",name2="char_367_swllow_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I don't know. I'm not sure if you'd say we... knew each other.

[name="Amiya"]  Yeah.
[name="Amiya"]  This is how it is for Rhodes Island... most of the time.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  But even if there's only the tiniest bit we can do, we will do it.
[name="Amiya"]  We have to.

[name="Amiya"]  I can't guess. And I don't want to take it from your mind.
[name="Amiya"]  Because... I think one day you'll tell me yourself.
[Predicate(references="3")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]
[name="Amiya"]  The operators have put in the work.
[name="Amiya"]  But death makes a heavy impression, heavier than saving someone. Every time we witness such death, it hits hard.
[name="Amiya"]  Just remember that without the efforts of our operators, we'd be seeing a lot more death.
[name="Amiya"]  So much more death...
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I used to think Rhodes Island fought for the Infected.
[name="GreyThroat"]  But now I see all the dead at our feet, they're all Infected.
[name="GreyThroat"]  Amiya...
[name="GreyThroat"]  Why does Rhodes Island fight?

[name="Amiya"]  Blaze.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]  ...Answer her.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]
[name="Amiya"]  Honestly, I ask myself the same question all the time.
[name="Amiya"]  We see people, Infected and uninfected, die every day.
[name="Amiya"]  We don't, and we shouldn't fight to stop every death. That would be meaningless in the grand scheme of things.
[name="Amiya"]  Like now... like in this battle in front of us.
[name="Amiya"]  It wasn't one crossbow, one Art, one explosion, or one wound that causes all the death.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  What we fight to defeat is the source of all of this... the hatred the uninfected have for the Infected, and vice versa, is the reason they kill each other.
[name="Amiya"]  We must tear up the soil that nurtures the hate. Using our pharmaceuticals, and our operations.

[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_002_amiya_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]  That was an Originium-boosted crossbow bolt.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_002_amiya_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]  Pretty lousy fireworks.
[name="Blaze"]  Nearl said, back in Chernobog, the scaly kid was pretty strong.
[name="Blaze"]  She told me her arms nearly broke. And I'll tell you from experience, I wouldn't be able to break them.
[name="Blaze"]  But back there, I knew his bowstring was as good as snapped, and he didn't have much Arts left in his weapon.
[name="Blaze"]  What happened to you, you little shit?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]  Hey, Amiya, would it be possible that he used some sort of Arts and survived from the attack?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]  ...I'm sorry.

[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]  She never shared. We're not close.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]  Her parents were Oripathy researchers, doing work for the Infected. They died in a clash between the Infected and police.
[name="Amiya"]  She just thinks her suffering and ours are the same.
[name="Amiya"]  GreyThroat is more sensitive than you give her credit for. She just doesn't express herself.
