From Chernobog to Londinium, you've encountered all forms of foes, some of which defied your wildest imagination.
But the enemy before you looks like the most formidable of all.
It is the product of the Confessarii's manipulation of 'blood', combined with the ultimate embodiment of Sarkaz physical strength.
Salus said that Sarkaz are much stronger than Cautuses, but you know that even Amiya's body is vastly stronger than yours.
And yet, you still have an advantage. Something sets you aside from others, something that makes you one of a kind.

The same is also true for the Chimera closest to you – its massive body crashes to the ground, Originium dust kicked up in every direction, rubbing and colliding, exploding in a dazzling gold.
