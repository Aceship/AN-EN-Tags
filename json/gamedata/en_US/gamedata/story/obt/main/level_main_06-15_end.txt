[name="FrostNova"]  I guess that's been swirling around in your head, huh?
[name="FrostNova"]  Villains are what villains are. I have no complaints about the ending I deserve.
[name="FrostNova"]  I have hurt you. Reunion, and I, targeted innocent Lungmenites and single-handedly led the Ursus Infected into this nightmare. Such people have no business at Rhodes Island.
[name="FrostNova"]  My brothers and sisters.... Those fools must have tried to keep me alive, huh?
[name="FrostNova"]  I thought that even if I died here, those idiots would get a place where they could live in peace.
[name="FrostNova"]  Wrong and wrong. They died. To protect me, a woman who didn't have much time left to begin with.
[name="FrostNova"]  I'm not happy. We were used and abused. Our lives thrown away.
[name="FrostNova"]  I'm not happy.... This last moment of life, this does not belong to me. They bought this with their blood!
[name="FrostNova"]  This little bit of life..... I must give it to someone trustworthy.
[name="FrostNova"]  Thank you.
[name="FrostNova"]  ...Ah... Even if we survived, where is there to go?
[name="FrostNova"]  We had nowhere. The only thing we were ever knew was the snow.
[name="FrostNova"]  Lungmen is not Ursus. We came, desperate to save our people, and the Infected, looking for a warm place, with food, and shelter....
[name="FrostNova"]  That's not Lungmen. From the beginning, it should not have been Lungmen. The people of Lungmen are also struggling to eke out a living.
[name="FrostNova"]  We should have gone back to Ursus.... Our homeland.....
[name="FrostNova"]  Snow.... a peaceful river.... the pine forests gently swaying.... the turquoise moss....
[name="FrostNova"]  This world, it's beautiful....
