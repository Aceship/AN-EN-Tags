A legend is bestowed by the people.
The miracle' you hold already existed before Lugalszargus and I met.
In the depths of the golden sands, explorers who should've been devoured by Catastrophes found safe haven because of this relic.
The relic was forged into a treasured blade, and I carried it along with the young Shah into the endless sands.

I still remember what he said as he rested against my mane beneath the stars––
'It shall have a name, but that name is not mine to give.'
Then, as legends go, he took up the blade and slew the Poltergeist King.
He never returned. Nobody in the land was worthy of giving that sword a name, but a legend was nevertheless born.

The Hero's sword.
It passed through the hands of many kings, until at long last, the Lion with hair as bright as the sun used it to sever the Red Dragon's head.
That story, you're already familiar with, Vina.
Beneath the gleaming blade, the Lion and Dragon ultimately stood side by side and swore an oath to lift the crown together.
Alas, the Hero's sword would slay no more, but would instead be regarded as 'the highest authority'.

It has endured loss and betrayal, yet its brilliance as the symbol of authority has never dimmed.
As Lugalszargus said, you have all sung of it from generation to generation using the name it was given – the Sighs of Kings.
No matter how many times it is reforged, craftsmen will always be able to hear the sighs from within the sword.
They say that it is the kings sighing, lamenting that the glorious empire no longer has enemies worth conquering.
But, it was never the kings who were sighing, but rather the blade itself – a 'miracle' dug out from the golden sands more than a millennium ago. Still, they had the right to give meaning to this sword.
[dialog]
[Blocker(a=1, r=0, g=0, b=0, fadetime=2, block=true)]
Vina, legends are never told by the heroes themselves.
But, you continued its story. Perhaps in twenty years, the children will sing...
'Alexandrina, the Sword of Victoria, the king who banished the Sarkaz tyrant!'
But, is this the story you want to hear? And, by whose right do you wield this sword?
The king's? The hero's? The peoples'?

Nothing needs to be spoken, nothing needs to be written...
The concealed dead have nowhere to hide. the Sudaram's piercing shriek forms into a longsword that shuttles through the fog.
The words from the whistle quiver, and the Banshee's song resounds––
Within the ancient bloodlines of the Sarkaz, in a valley choked with Originium, amidst the lamentations of countless people who fell in battle...
Flaming shells and witchcraft-imbued rounds intertwine in the skies above the battlefield.
A high-speed battleship crashes into a witchcraft bastion.
A small number of Victorian soldiers charge head-first into an entire squad of Nachzehrers.
The song grows louder and clearer.
When that song reaches its climax, the Nachzehrer soldiers fall into silence and stop attacking one after another, like motionless flags.
They no longer hunt.
At last, death has returned to the land.

[name="???"]War has come to answer your song.
The withered branches retreat in unison. They coil, then lie down, returning once more to their long-deceased forms.
The most hideous and ancient among them still seem to be struggling unwillingly, finally twisting into a scepter.
The tip of the scepter strikes the ground, and a figure emerges from the depths of the dense fog.

The corners of his clothes flutter, as the fog disperses.
The Sudaram's white robes are scattered across the dense white hills of withered branches. Longswords lie fallen and shattered, like grass in a forest.
The young Banshee sits sideways atop the hill, his bloodstained fingers plucking at the bone whistle in front of his lips...
Gentle. Melodious.
