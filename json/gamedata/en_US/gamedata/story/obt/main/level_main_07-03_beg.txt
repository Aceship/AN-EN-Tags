[name="Amiya"]  Attention, our outstanding operators, I have some important information to report to everyone in Rhodes Island. This is Amiya.
[name="Amiya"]  As of last night, Rhodes Island has officially left Lungmen.
[name="Amiya"]  In light of recent developments, the trade agreement between us and Lungmen has been cancelled. We no longer have any reason or standing to remain inside the city.
[name="Amiya"]  Fortunately, we’ve already purchased a lot of supplies from Lungmen, which will sustain our operations for a while.
[name="Amiya"]  Unfortunately... Some of our operators will shortly be going deep into Chernobog’s core city.
[name="Amiya"]  An extremely tough battle awaits us there.
[name="Amiya"]  ...Many may think that war is a distant concern to us.
[name="Amiya"]  War, they may say, is a conflict between two countries, and has nothing to do with a pharmaceutical company.
[name="Amiya"]  But war... I think war has never left us. 
[name="Amiya"]  We have always been in a war. The long war of injustice against the Infected, the war that drives people to hate one another.
[name="Amiya"]  To develop an effective treatment for Oripathy and give the Infected a chance to use it, our medics have poured countless hours into their research.
[name="Amiya"]  Likewise, it has always been our goal to provide the most advanced medical treatment to those here who suffer from Oripathy, inhibiting and slowing the progression of Oripathy.
[name="Amiya"]  But that is far from enough. Before we can achieve these goals, we must face the ever-growing conflicts between the Infected and uninfected.
[name="Amiya"]  The enemies of the Infected will not see them treated. And each crime they commit against the Infected aggravates the tensions between the groups.
[name="Amiya"]  All while others exploit and enslave the Infected for their own profit.
[name="Amiya"]  There are those who oppose us and even attack us, solely because we seek a cure for Oripathy... We have suffered this in the past.
[name="Amiya"]  Imagine... Imagine if we develop a medicine to treat this disease, but never have a chance to administer it to the Infected. What then?
[name="Amiya"]  Our enemy is not only “Oripathy.” There is no safety for us standing back from this war anymore.
[name="Amiya"]  Two weeks ago, Reunion and Rhodes Island engaged in a violent confrontation. Many of our operators sacrificed themselves in Chernobog.
[name="Amiya"]  ...a story we have seen unfold far too many times.
[name="Amiya"]  But if every sacrifice demands vengeance from us, then we will be locked into an endless cycle of revenge. Countless lives... will be taken.
[name="Amiya"]  Taken by our enemies, and taken by our own hands.
[name="Amiya"]  Our struggle with Reunion cannot rest upon hatred. If we are able to negotiate with them, we will demand from them an explanation, and hold them accountable for their actions.
[name="Amiya"]  But Reunion is still gripped by their madness, even today. They have taken control of Chernobog’s core city, and are driving it into Lungmen.
[name="Amiya"]  Even stranger, Ursus has not surrendered its territorial control of the core city.
[name="Amiya"]  They retain a territorial claim on Chernobog, even with it under Reunion’s control, even when Ursus never...                                                      
[name="Amiya"]  Even when Ursus never took action as this entire incident unfolded. The Empire of Ursus ignored the atrocities committed in Chernobog, and made no effort to stop them whatsoever.
[name="Amiya"]  ...They abandoned their own citizens.
[name="Amiya"]  This has led me to conclude that Ursus has conspired to bring about these events. A collision with the core city will spark an international war. A war between Ursus and Yen——
[name="Amiya"]  By then, it will be too late.
[name="Amiya"]  No matter who stands behind Reunion, no matter how hard they’ve pushed, no matter who the real mastermind behind all this is: there will be only one truth laid grimly at our feet.
[name="Amiya"]  ——”The Infected caused this war.”
[name="Amiya"]  No matter the outcome of the war, the Infected will always be the scapegoat.
[name="Amiya"]  They will face even more brutal oppression, more miserable lives, and... an eternal, fiery hatred.
[name="Amiya"]  If that comes to pass, all Rhodes Island has done will come to nothing. There won’t be a single country in the world that will allow us to treat the Infected, or allow them a normal life.
[name="Amiya"]  Indeed... this is an unavoidable part of our protracted war on Oripathy.
[name="Amiya"]  Rhodes Island has always been fighting this war. And it’s a difficult war to win.
[name="Amiya"]  But despite that, we will never give up.
[name="Amiya"]  We will fight the fanatics with reason, and enmity with clever strategy. We will press on, because no one wants to see a bitter end to our efforts.
[name="Amiya"]  So we will stop Reunion. We will stop the Chernobog core city from colliding with Lungmen.
[name="Amiya"]  I hope those of you staying here on the landship will look after Rhodes Island. Whether or not we return, Rhodes Island will fight on.
[name="Amiya"]  Right. Situation normal.

[name="Pilot"]  You don’t need us to land for this op, do you, Instructor?
[name="Pilot"]  There isn’t a good spot on the core city, and Reunion isn’t exactly poorly equipped. They’ve got casters too. Landing would be trucky.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  No need. Just make it look like we’re going to land, but keep circling the city.
[name="Dobermann"]  We didn’t bring a tactical team. Not much we can do with just the two of us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Pilot"]  Yeah, didn’t think of that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  ...How would you not think of that...?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Pilot"]  J-Just kidding, Instructor. Put the whip down.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  Hah... We got the wuss who flies the “Bad Guy” and now this joker.
[name="Dobermann"]  You can keep us up for a half an hour, can’t you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Pilot"]  Not a problem!
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  Just keep their attention! The Reunion element in the ruins knows we have aircraft, but we can't be sure about what their people in the core city might know.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Pilot"]  Rest assured, you’re riding the “Good Boy,” and he’s a lot noisier than the “Bad Guy!” It’ll be all eyes on us for a solid half hour. Just watch me, Instructor!
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  Careful now. Don’t get us shot down.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Pilot"]  Just sit back and relax, Instructor. I chauffeured Blaze and Ascalon around a hundred times and we never got shot down on any of those low flights.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  ...Getting shot down is a one time thing...

[name="Reunion Member"]  What’s that...? Up in the sky?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="char_1002_nsabr_2", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  They’re flying?! The enemy brought a new weapon! What country is it from?! Just shoot it down already!
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="char_1002_nsabr_2", focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  We don’t know what it’s carrying. We can’t let it land!
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1", name2="char_1002_nsabr_2", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Don’t panic! If it drops low enough, we’ll light it up! Just don’t let it out of your sight!

[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Pilot"]  Are you afraid of heights, Instructor?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  ......
[name="Dobermann"]  A little.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Pilot"]  Don’t worry!
[name="Pilot"]  If something goes wrong, we won’t have time to react. The crash will pulverize us. Won’t even be able to identify our bodies. The great equalizer!
