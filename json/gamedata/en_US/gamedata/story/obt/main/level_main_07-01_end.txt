Wei Yenwu’s Office - 6:30 PM
[Dialog]
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",fadetime=1,block=true)]
[delay(time=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Correct, Mr. Wei. Thirty-two hours from now, the core city will collide with Lungmen.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Its urban identification code has not been changed, which means that the core of Chernobog, this nomadic city, is still Ursus territory.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_010_chen_1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch’en"]  So attacking it would be an act of war...?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1")]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Reunion holding Ursus hostage like this is the height of absurdity.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You're unreasonably calm, Mr. Wei. Did it maybe occur to you what a peace-loving country the Empire is?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Ursus expansionism is driven by a lust for wealth, territory, and growth.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  If it was profitable, the Empire would start a world war without a second thought. And they would’ve done it decades ago.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  But to provoke a war with Yen?
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  The fact that Yen has not waged war for centuries does not mean they lack the capacity to fight. But I’d say a militaristic state might struggle to understand what it is that’s led to Yen’s prosperity.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  A world war would leave both sides devastated. Yen would need a long time to recover, but Ursus, with its myriad internal conflicts, would take it even harder.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Ursus is no longer the world-devouring beast it once was. Only fools and madmen would wage a war that is costly, unprofitable, and doomed to fail.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Mr. Wei, as far as I know, fools and madmen are a dime a dozen in the nomadic cities of the world.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1")]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Weeding out such people is one of my most important duties. And it’s a function of the State Council of Ursus.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5")]
[name="Ch’en"]  ......
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1")]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Once the State Council responds, we’ll implement measures to put a stop to the Chernobog core.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  The diplomats will handle the rest.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Our only responsibility is to take control of this crisis before it gets out of hand.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You have that much faith in the Empire?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  No. I have faith in mutual interest.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Fighting war after war teaches bitter lessons. And even though Ursus has won a lot of riches from its wars, it has been unable to fight the internal rot those wars have bred...
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  It has not been able to integrate the peoples and lands it has conquered. And no nation can handle a rebellion while choking down the poison brewed by the mutual crisscrossing hate of its own populace.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  The Empire of Ursus is a rotting corpse posturing to look strong.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And that is why you believe Ursus will act in its own interests and abide by their deal with you?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1")]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I have no deal with the Chairman of the State Council, verbal or otherwise. But the two of us have about the same amount of sanity left.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Fumizuki, send the message for me. I have to make use of this time...
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_2006_weiywfmzuki_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fumizuki"]  Um.

[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ...Fumizuki?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_2006_weiywfmzuki_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fumizuki"]  There is another message here. For you.
[Character(name="char_2006_weiywfmzuki_1")]
[name="Fumizuki"]  Dr. Kal'tsit, Amiya, Ch’en... you should hear this too.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",name2="char_2006_weiywfmzuki_1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It sounds like the Chairman of the State Council plans to stand by and see how this plays out.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The State Council is at the heart of the Empire... But Chernobog is out on the periphery now.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The borderlands mostly belong to the Army, and some remnants of the ancient nobility.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Army hasn’t had a chance to engage in such operations since the Great Rebellion, but the Infected did.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The ancient nobility, closely watched as they were, couldn’t have planned the Chernobog incident, but the Infected could.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Indeed, most of Reunion’s Infected had no training, they didn’t stand a chance against the Ursus Guard and the Chernobog riot police—
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But a Catastrophe did. Chernobog failed to split the plates in time, and there was nothing they could do against a Catastrophe.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Reunion had to infiltrate the city early to stop the security forces from mobilizing, while the Army ignored their maneuvering.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Lungmen and Rhodes Island anticipated Reunion’s actions, and the L.G.D. made a plan to annihilate them, but Chernobog...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Even to this day, Chernobog, and the Ursus Court... haven’t said a word.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Now we know why.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Writing off the city and all its inhabitants, Ursus handed Chernobog over to Reunion.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And the Infected, who have lived so long on the threshold of death that they no longer fear it, would assume control of the city after the Catastrophe.
[Character(name="char_2006_weiywfmzuki_1")]
[name="Fumizuki"]  They didn’t have to do anything. They just... got out of the way.
[name="Fumizuki"]  They only had to let it happen.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  But after suffering a Catastrophe, Chernobog was just a dead city with nothing of value...
[Character(name="char_2006_weiywfmzuki_1")]
[name="Fumizuki"]  Which left the Infected heading for Lungmen! No matter who’s running Reunion, this... all the elements were perfectly aligned...!
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1#5")]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ——
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Give the order. The censors must stand down, use force if necessary. We will prepare for war. We must be absolutely certain we can disable that core before it’s too late.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  And no one is to know of this until the Chernobog core is stopped.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6")]
[name="Amiya"]  Mr. Wei?!
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",name2="char_2006_weiywfmzuki_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fumizuki"]  You’re going to start the war yourself?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",name2="char_2006_weiywfmzuki_1",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Fumizuki, you’ve seen all Lungmen has been through, you must know. My brother wouldn’t stand for me starting a war with Ursus.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ...I must take the initiative, we must take control of the situation, even if it costs all of Lungmen.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Starting a war means being seen as an aggressor. It makes it more difficult to forge alliances.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The first one to enter a state of war is likely to find itself isolated.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  But... the worst part is, no one can know the truth until after the war is over, whatever it might be...!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Some countries don’t even care about the truth. All they want is an excuse.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But, Mr. Wei, I believe we can achieve peace through diplomatic means.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Thank you for the suggestion, Madam Kal'tsit.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  But I’m afraid Witte and I are the last hope for peace between our two countries.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Whether our enemy is the Empire’s Third Army or the Emperor of Ursus, this war is going to happen eventually, even if we are certain to win it. Peace is no longer possible.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  If Witte is too meek to use official channels to put a stop to this, it means he’ll face too much resistance and criticism for it, even if it works. He’s a politician. He has to look out for himself.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Having pushed him this far, the Empire’s bureaucracy may be in some state of semi-paralysis.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  A couple of divisions can hold Ursus hostage, but not Lungmen. This is not Ursus, you’re entitled to an emergency response to another moving city.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]  Wouldn’t it then be too late to separate the city?!
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  If the core is not stopped, the collision will destroy Lungmen. And the conflict that follows will cause further, unfathomable disaster.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]  But to stop the core...
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Firing our guns or sending a spec ops team would indeed mean a declaration of war on Ursus.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Anything Witte might have been able to stop has been cut completely loose by the Chernobog core.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  An isolated city, cut off from all communication, left with nothing but identification codes, needs very little explanation.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  As you say, Doctor. It’s up to Lungmen now. Only we can stop the Chernobog core.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Think carefully, Mr. Wei. There are serious consequences to an act of war.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  War is serious business, but the other choice, as far as Lungmen is concerned, would be far worse.
