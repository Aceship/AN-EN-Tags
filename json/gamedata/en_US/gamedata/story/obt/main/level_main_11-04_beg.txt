[name="Londinium Merchant"]You need certain... 'goods' transported into Londinium, and this is nothing like what we usually carry. Both the quantity and the weight... are highly unusual.
[name="Londinium Merchant"]I shan't ask what it is you need transported and why you need them brought into the city, but you must know that the risk we will carry for transporting them is immense.
[name="Londinium Merchant"]And I'm certain you know there are not many men out there who can do this for you.
[name="Londinium Merchant"]The Sarkaz keep a close eye on all ports of entry. Should they learn of this under-the-table deal, not one of us will leave Londinium alive.
[name="Londinium Merchant"]Even if your background and the greed of your friends watching your back are enough to keep your lifestyle in Central Londinium as is, I'm afraid they won't help with this affair.
[name="Londinium Merchant"]If you want this deal to go through, you must put something worth the risk on the table.
