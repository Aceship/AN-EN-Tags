[name="Golding"]Thank you for accepting my plea, Damazti.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]It is not a difficult wish to grant.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Coincidentally, we just freed ourselves from some nastier things.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]A classroom. You ended up inviting us here in the end.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]A rational and reasonable decision, Golding. You always said you saw yourself as a teacher, after all.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]I think, I shall die here today.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]You're set on this.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Lettou will be sad.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]I have to do it.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Why are you so hung up on this?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]You're right, why am I?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]I can't let go of the children, I worry that they can't find a place to belong in our current world. I can't let go of Molly either, she's a good girl, but she doesn't know how to protect herself.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]And of course, there's Heidi... but I've let her down. I only hope she won't resent me.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]Probably a difficult thing to do, seeing as I've caused the deaths of so many.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]I deserve any resentment coming my way.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Golding, you know dying like this won't change anything.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Honestly, we're confused by your decision...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]In our long-lived experience, it isn't rare to see one embrace death, but we're still puzzled by it.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]We are well familiar with the words, 'sacrifice,' 'repellence,' 'guilt,' and perhaps even more.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]The final outcome always leads to death.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Sorry, but this is such a futile act to us. Death holds little meaning and isn't worth such obsession.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]Death is just death.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]I know what you mean, Damazti. I understand what you're saying.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]If I wished to make amends for the fallen Self-Salvation Corps fighters, perhaps the better choice would've been to live on, to care for the families left behind, to heal the suffering in their stead.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]But, I know... I can't do that, I can't possibly face all that...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]I'm so scared.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Is facing death easier than facing your fears?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]Perhaps.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]I've always run away from things... I thought I could keep living as long as I avoided getting caught by the tide.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]But when does one finally stop running and admit that one's life has fallen apart?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]When does one admit that one's old life never existed in the first place?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]I can't bring myself to face all of this, so I'd rather choose to die before I completely succumb to my despair.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_647_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Golding"]Let me lie to myself just this once, Damazti.

[name="'Golding'"]We just... want to better understand your feelings.
[name="'Golding'"]It's a difficult emotion to understand, so we can only try to feel it firsthand.
[name="Golding"]You asked me before how to live a life.
[name="Golding"]How am I even supposed to come up with an answer?
[name="Golding"]Then again, now that I've realized my own powerlessness, choosing to give up could also count as a choice, right?
[name="'Golding'"]'Give up,' Lettou also said this before.
[name="Golding"]No, it's not about giving up on yourself and letting life wash over you.
[name="Golding"]It's to give up on the act of living.
[name="'Golding'"]Give up on living, you say.
[name="Golding"]All these experiences...whether they hold joy or pain, there isn't really a need to hold onto them so tightly, right?
[name="Golding"]In fact, you feel as though you're in the middle of a labyrinth, you realize the walls are in fact made of said experiences.
[name="Golding"]I wouldn't even call this a struggle, it truly is the coward's choice.
[name="Golding"]But at least... I won't stand by their side again, right?
[name="Golding"]I'm... just so tired of it all.
[name="'Golding'"]......

Baird staggers to a wall, and slowly sits herself down, drawing a long bloodstain behind her.
Her hand is already going numb. She tries to make a fist, but to no avail.

[name="Baird"]Hah.

She turns her head and spots a corpse not far from her. Lean and emaciated, he seems to have died a few days ago.
It suddenly occurs to her how familiar the corpse's face is.

[name="Baird"]So this is where you ended up, Mr. 'Next Academician.'

A can of meat lay close to the timid citizen, its contents completely cleaned out without even a little bit remaining.
Baird blinks a few times at something strange by the poor man's side. From the wall to the floor is... a bunch of black curvy lines?
Words and diagrams.
Only now does Baird realize that he had picked up another pen to write with— a battered charcoal pencil, a tool far less respectable than his precious fountain pen.
She touches her own pocket. The fine fountain pen that had belonged to him is still with her. It's a shame McClaren never read the final words written by this gorgeous pen.
She manages to drag her body with some difficulty towards the writing on the wall, and carefully makes out the tiny handwriting.
She laughs, and also starts coughing.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_863_1#9$1",focus="m")]

Baird skips over the long, stupefying paragraphs of research and references.
The paper ends abruptly. After a blank page is an angry note from the man on how he had forgotten some important material he wanted to add.
His desperation shows through the broken writing that eventually fades off the page.
At some point, he seems to have begun writing his wishes instead.
