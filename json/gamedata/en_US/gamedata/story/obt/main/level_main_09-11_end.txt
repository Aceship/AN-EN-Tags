[name="Horn"]Colonel Hamilton, I hope you understand what you've done.
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]What I've done? I've succeeded in defeating Victoria's enemies, and brought us an all too rare victory.
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#7")]
[name="Horn"]You truly think you'll win?
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]We have eradicated the rabble occupying the city hall and our other important facilities. You can hear it, can't you? Our troops are taking back the city, bit by bit.
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]Suppose things do go as you intend, the spectre force never recovers from this, and you successfully defend County Hillock—
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#7")]
[name="Horn"]You will still have brought Victoria a terrible, irreconcilable defeat!
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1#6")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]What nonsense are you spouting? I see. You're still soft on those commoners.
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]Let me say this again, Skamandros. This is war, and victory comes hand in hand with bloodshed.
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#7")]
[name="Horn"]Enough rationalizing your actions. The locals here have always been part of your plan.
[name="Horn"]When you ordered the artillery battalion to make those dirty bombs in secret, the spectre force wasn't anywhere close to infiltrating County Hillock!
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]Not one to give up easily, are we?
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1#5")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]But fine. All has gone without a hitch, and there's no opportunity left for you to get in the way.
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#7")]
[name="Horn"]Without a hitch? Because you fanned the flames of war you saw before you?
[name="Horn"]War is not an end, but a means.
[name="Horn"]The wars we fought over the past decades were meant to safeguard Victoria's peace and prosperity. But you? In an afternoon, you laid waste to lifetimes of hard work.
[name="Horn"]How dare you blindly attack the common folk in the name of the Victorian Army? Regardless of ancestry, these people are still Victorian citizens!
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]They call themselves Tarans!
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]And how much of our country's population is Taran? One-tenth? One-fifth?
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#7")]
[name="Horn"]Right. You see them in the minority, but when the ire of so many is set alight, it could very well burn down the whole Empire!
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1#5")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]Hmph. They stand no chance against the might of the Victorian Army.
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#7")]
[name="Horn"]They should never have had a need for that chance!
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]Look at that book you're reading. You marvel at the achievements of the first Aslan king, but did you ever consider what it was that propelled a foreign Aslan to become ruler of Victoria?
[name="Horn"]If the Aslans hadn't signed an armistice with the Dracos, and if the Draco King Gaeil hadn't yielded to the royal family's decision, the Victoria we know today would never have existed in the first place!

[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=30, ystrength=30, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Horn"]What right do you have—to push Victoria to the brink of civil war once again, all for your own hatred and prejudice?!
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]Do you really believe everything you've just spouted, Skamandros?
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]Do you really believe that I, the commander of a single garrison in the countryside, could steer the Empire of Victoria with a wave of my hand?
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1#5")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]Have you ever wondered, why... why Londinium is so deafeningly silent?
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#2")]
[name="Horn"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1#2")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]I could have killed you. Even being the noble you are, Londinium would never hold me accountable for the death of a lieutenant to rebel cannon fire.
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]But I didn't. I respect your loyalty to Victoria, and I cannot bear to see so-called human nature blunt Her blades.
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]Open your eyes. The war began long ago! And until the last of our enemies lies dead, we will never have true victory!
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]Have you ever considered that all you do could be playing right into those enemies' hands?
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]What you fear is, in fact, my greatest hope—
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]I wish for the fate of the Tarans to be known across all of Victoria!
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]It is not the people I want to destroy. No, I look to destroy their courage.
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=30, ystrength=30, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]I want the whole world to know that, should they dare to turn against us, they must be prepared to withstand the fire of Victoria's rage!
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#2")]
[name="Horn"]......
[name="Horn"]How much innocent blood will it take to douse these flames you started today?
[name="Horn"]Grand dukes with sinister motives, all the surrounding countries with their hidden agendas, and the outsiders teeming with ambition—
[name="Horn"]—With all these ill-meaning sides gathered in one spot, Londinium, maybe even all of Victoria, endures far more pressure than one place should bear.
[name="Horn"]All those parties, biding their time, need just one little push, and, bang—
[name="Horn"]The fire will spread, and it won't stop at the Tarans, it will spread all across the once-prosperous lands, sparing no one in its path.
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]And how... is that worse than letting the parasites chew you hollow from the inside-out, not doing a thing to stop them?
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]It seems there's no going back for you.
[name="Horn"]In that case, we have nothing further to discuss.
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]Perfect, then. I have no need to keep you locked up here. Away with you, if you please.
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#7")]
[name="Horn"]Once you release me, I will make sure you answer for your crimes.
[name="Horn"]I swear this on Triangle's team—No matter what happens, as long as I live, I will see you court martialed!
[character(name="avg_npc_227_1#6")]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]Hah. You think that's enough to frighten me?
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]Listen, Skamandros. If Victoria wishes to lay down judgement, She knows where to find me.
[character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]And I can't wait to see it done.

[name="Janie"]After the conversation we had, I remembered some things from ages ago I'd forgotten.
[name="Janie"]My da's a lawyer, and he used to tell me stories about how my grandda's grandda came to Victoria with nothing. He went from rags to riches.
[name="Janie"]The Victoria he described was an advanced, open-minded, prosperous country.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]Here, technology and capital conquered savagery. The people's hard work and wealth wouldn't be destroyed just like that by Catastrophes or racial conflict.
[name="Janie"]In making it to such a magnificent land, we Vouivre were able to live a 'civilized' life, compared to one of barbarism and violence in the old country.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#5",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Outcast"]Victoria was the most advanced industrialized nation in the world, for a very long time..
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#5",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]But we had to give up a lot, in order to become Victorians...
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#5",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]When I was five, I climbed to the top of the tallest tree in our garden. My da caught me having a blast and gave me a good scolding.
[name="Janie"]Then he locked me in my room and gave me dozens of books to read. The next day, he hired a Leithanian piano teacher for me.
[name="Janie"]I missed the view from the top of the tree, but I didn't give it much thought. I knew my da was doing it for my own good.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#6$1",focus=1)]

[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]That's right. Books, piano, the garden... He understood that those were all things we'd need to know, in order to enjoy the life we had.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]And, I also remembered another thing...
[name="Janie"]This one time after school, I saw a few older kids bullying a young Feline girl behind my favorite bakery.
[name="Janie"]They laughed at her, saying her clothes were dirty and that she didn't know anything.
[name="Janie"]After they left, I went up to her and gave her a few novels I had in my school bag.
[name="Janie"]I thought she'd be able to talk to the kids her age once she finished reading them, and the others wouldn't pick on her anymore...
[name="Janie"]About a week later, I was all excited, went looking for her so we could talk about the books, but she just shook her head and handed them back to me.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]I could tell right away. She never even flipped them open. I was really mad. Here I was trying to befriend her, lending her my books, and she wouldn't even accept my kindness.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]It wasn't until much later, I realized...
[name="Janie"]She couldn't read.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#5",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#9$1",focus=1)]
[name="Outcast"]She was the child of a bakery worker, not even a baker. How was she supposed to get an education? Forget enjoying any of the same things you did.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#5",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]It turns out, even being able to read a novel is a luxury.

[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#5",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]I wasn't willing to accept that before... I'd let myself grow accustomed to the 'rules,' and that was how I became a proper Victorian. And those who live outside the rules, well, our country would never accept them.

[name="Outcast"]It takes courage to open your mind on your own like that.

[name="Operator Oliver"]Shredder?!
[character(name2="avg_npc_245_1#7",focus=-1)]
[name="Operator Shredder"]Oliver, feel free to add another note to the report, that you fired me here on the spot.
[character(name2="avg_npc_245_1#7",focus=-1)]
[name="Operator Oliver"]You've got to be out of your mind!
[name="Operator Oliver"]Okay, yeah... Fine. Go. You're saving an Infected, aren't you? That's Rhodes Island's bread and butter!
[name="Operator Oliver"]I'm not leaving without any one of you. Get to the rendezvous point on time!
[character(name2="avg_npc_245_1#7")]
[name="Outcast"]Thanks, Oliver. You're a great leader.
[name="Outcast"]Shredder, I appreciate the help, but I hope you'll take my advice.
[name="Outcast"]That is—Stay here.
[name="Outcast"]I'll go by myself. Whatever happens, do not come after me. Go straight to the rendezvous point.
[character(name2="avg_npc_245_1#7",focus=-1)]
[name="Operator Shredder"]Right... I'll be there.

[name="Outcast"]Jane, you aren't trying to stop me, are you?
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#1",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]Are you really going to save her? I heard she was one of the rioters' central figures...
[name="Janie"]She might even be the one who killed Saoirse!
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#5",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Outcast"]Honestly, I doubt a mysterious group with big plans would leave their true leader to die on the street.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#5",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]Phew... That's alright, then... I—I feel much better now.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Outcast"]——
[name="Outcast"]But what if she was the one who killed her? What would you do? Would you ask me to leave her to die?
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]To tell the truth... I don't know.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]But I agree with what you said. She's a poor Infected girl who desperately needs our help.
[name="Janie"]I guess I might ask her once she's out of danger...
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]Never mind, I'm probably overthinking it. I'll stop wasting your time.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#5$1",focus=1)]
[name="Outcast"]Off I go then.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]Hold on. One more thing...
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]Remember what you told me? Make sure you're safe yourself before you help anyone else!
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#1",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Outcast"]Well, lookie here. Our little Janie's trying to educate me.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#1",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#3$1",focus=2)]
[name="Janie"]No... I wouldn't presume to...
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#1",name2="avg_479_sleach_1#3$1",focus=1)]
[name="Outcast"]Don't worry.
[name="Outcast"]It's just as we said—I'm saving a regular old Infected.
