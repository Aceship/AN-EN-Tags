[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#1")]
[name="Outcast"]'The Accountant,' 'The Convict,' 'The Immolator,' 'The Toxicologist,' 'The Bandit'—And you, 'The Elocutionist.'
[name="Outcast"]Mighty familiar names.
[name="Outcast"]Far from the first time we've met—
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#2")]
[name="Outcast"]You, 'The Accountant.' You've meticulously worked out the profit this war'll reap you, and you're racking your brains to turn even more lives into bigger numbers, deeper black on your balance sheet.
[name="Outcast"]You, 'The Convict.' You escape from prison again and again only to commit greater crimes, get yourself sent back to prison to repeat the cycle again.
[name="Outcast"]You, 'The Immolator.' Burning single houses and families hasn't given you what you need for a long while. Soon, not even burning a whole city will fill the hole in your heart.
[name="Outcast"]You, 'The Toxicologist.' You call yourself a scholar, but fancy titles don't hide the truth, that you're all caught up in heartless slaughter and one nasty scheme after another—
[name="Outcast"]—And your next betrayal will take a few cities to hell with you.
[name="Outcast"]You, 'The Bandit.' Living up to that name, you're thirsty to snatch anything you can from the hands of others, and not just money, either.
[name="Outcast"]You steal their dignity, and your lust for it will bring whole countries to ruin.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#1")]
[name="Outcast"]And then there's you, 'The Elocutionist.' You're really into those five dollar words, trying your hardest to turn fancy talk into a political weapon, the kind to spark wars greater and uglier.

[name="Outcast"]If I let any of you through, that girl will die, and all that evil I just talked about gets to carry on, free and clear.

Six bullets shoot out of her revolver at once.
At the same time, six enemies are charging toward her—
One of them is trying to hack away at her with his axe. Another is trying to spray a toxic gas at her. A third is trying to deflect her bullets with his Arts, while a fourth is trying to take the chance to dash past her, toward the other end of the alleyway.
But their actions will forever be frozen at the very moment they began.
Before any of them can cry out in surprise or fall to the ground, they have turned to dust in a holy light.
The moment she fired her gun, their judgment was already complete.
