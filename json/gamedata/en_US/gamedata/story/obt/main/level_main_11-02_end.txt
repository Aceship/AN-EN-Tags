[name="Molly"]Also, they told me their teacher once saw something even greater.
[name="Molly"]It was the year Victoria had just defeated Gaul, and to celebrate the then-King's birthday, dozens of Steam Knights all returned to Londinium together.
[name="Molly"]Their suits were draped in flags of Victoria, and once they'd all marched down the steps on the Palace of Westhaleg, it was like one giant flag all at once—
[name="Molly"]And then, everyone heard a howl even clearer than thunder.

[name="Naughty Child"]A howl?
[Character(name="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_657_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Molly"]Yes, a howl. The people who were there say it was Victoria's emblem, the symbol on our flag, coming alive.

[Character(name="avg_npc_647_1#7$1")]
[name="Golding"]...Charles Lynch.
[name="Golding"]He used to live in Auchterigg. Tom the cobbler was an old friend of his, hence why he loves to tell tales of His Majesty and the Steam Knights so much.
[name="Golding"]In fact, Lynch was the last Steam Knight His Majesty ever titled in his life.
[Character(name="avg_npc_647_1#2$1")]
[name="Golding"]And the last Steam Knight titled up till now.

From not far away sound uniform footsteps.
They're unlike those the Londiniers have heard at parades. These are heavier, and more urgent.
The Palace of Westhaleg. The Shard. Parliament Square.
One flight after another in seamless succession, through Auchterigg's almost desolate streets, through the center of Londinium, Victoria's heart.
As the footsteps press towards this most ordinary of streets, some of those ducked to the side of the street finally catch clear sight of the advancing army—
Or better said, they see clearly the soldiers' appearances.
The horns, each shape their own, all condensed in ominous black, not even the rushing yawn of daylight casting a shine on them.
