If few are the heroes who can use it to conquer Catastrophe, then let humanity use its wisdom to raise a shield against the storm.
These structures, the entire building, was made for this.
The voices rise up again.
The calls are no longer urgent, no longer sharp, no longer attempting to persuade or incite.
She feels a tired sense of peace.
She has been here before. She has been guided to this place, long before her memories took shape.
Just like then, she knows where she must go, what she must take.
It is right there, in the middle of the room, unguarded, so unremarkable it might as well have been a tiny decoration in this grand building.

She is the source of all those visions and sounds.
They are her doubts, confusion, regrets, recollections.
Things she has forgotten, and things she intentionally forgot.
A great hand raises her. Londinium stands up from beneath her, taking her across the land of Victoria.
The land that she and her friends walked.
Countless voices superimpose upon one another.
Victoria, Victoria.
This is Victoria.
Her Victoria.

Allerdale's voice is calm, but filled with a terrible, resolute sorrow.
Siege recalls the 'memoirs' that Morgan wrote in jest.
A handful of pages, clumsily written, with less-than-elegant vocabulary.
The story starts with a fictional fight. Everyone returns to base after the fight. Allerdale makes a cream stew for them in the story.
She laughs in her heart. Allerdale made a stew, yes, but what the memoirs omitted is that...
It did not exactly taste great.

[name="Allerdale"]We'll bomb the Sarkaz camp together. You light a fire, and I'll kick their commander's arse once there's smoke.

[name="Allerdale"]So...

[name="Siege"]The answer is yes.

A sound breaks the stalemate.
Was it an illusion?
Siege looks around. The massive statues remain still in the shadows. None of the dead Sarkaz come back to life.

Again.
Nearby, right in front of her.
The sound of steam gushing, increasingly rapid.
Increasingly loud, increasingly clear, until it fills the entire space.
