[name="Theresa"]You came too late, and you missed the most beautiful moment.
[name="Theresa"]The first flower that budded died last night, but look at it now.
[name="Kal'tsit"]It's full of vigor still.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I see no difference compared to before.
[name="Theresa"]Exactly.

This garden, built on top of Originium, is the fruit of Theresa's painstaking labor.
Aside from war, the other path that Theresa found for the Sarkaz is close at hand.
But what kind of future does this path lead to?
[name="Kal'tsit"]Ever since you brought the Doctor here, you've been spending more time in the garden.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Babel still has a lot that needs you, our chairman, to handle, but on top of that, you were absent from today's general meeting.
[name="Theresa"]Not only do we have you, we also have the Doctor here now to help us. It's not much of a problem if I take it easy once in a while, isn't it?
[name="Kal'tsit"]I know you, Theresa. You were never one to joke around when it came to important business.
[name="Theresa"]Kal'tsit...
[name="Kal'tsit"]Hm?
[name="Theresa"]Do you know what the Doctor thinks?
[name="Kal'tsit"]...
[name="Kal'tsit"]No, I'm not sure what you've heard, but my guess is you do not have our mutual friend's full support.
[name="Theresa"]I won't give up, Kal'tsit.
[name="Theresa"]If this is how we're supposed to resolve the predicament that the Sarkaz is facing now, I'll go talk to Theresis.
[name="Theresa"]I will show this path to all the Sarkaz, so that they know we aren't fated to live a vicious cycle of hatred.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Theresa—
[name="Theresa"]Kal'tsit, please hear me out first.
[name="Theresa"]I know very well that this could be risky, but I trust you.
[name="Theresa"]If you find me walking toward an uncontrollable future while I'm on this path, please pull me back.
[name="Theresa"]I know you can do this, even though you always keep your opinions to yourself on many things.
[name="Kal'tsit"]If you want that future you're hoping for to actually come true, we'll still have to earn the Doctor's support.
[name="Kal'tsit"]When it comes to Originium utilization, the Doctor is... irreplaceable.
[name="Kal'tsit"]But regardless of what awaits us at the end...
[name="Kal'tsit"]...I promise you: when the time comes, I will be there by your side.
