The sharp black branches pierce through her abdomen.
Fresh blood gushes down, and converges with Qui'sartuštaj's blood.
The ancient tree long crystallized into Originium bursts a sudden pure white glow.
In just a moment, countless little moons rise to the top of the tree.
Every Confessarius begins to sing—

Shining shuts her eyes.
She strains to imagine... the time she spent together with Liz.
They run in the woods, hand in hand.
They cross the ice-cold creek together.
With Liz worn out on her back, she walks the road home.
Liz makes a small flower wreath and places it on Shining's head.
A small blue fowlbeast follows them the whole time, chirping a cheery tune over their heads.
It hovers, searches—and lands next to the sleeping white demon.
It does not know why Liz is sleeping, and anxiously pecks at her cheek with its little beak.
Until a black arrow pierces it.
The fowlbeast vanishes, leaving only a blue feather that lands on Shining's shoulder.
