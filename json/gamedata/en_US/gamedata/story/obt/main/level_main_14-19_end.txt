W hears voices innumerable, but it is not as she had imagined.
She thought she would hear angry roars like the revenant's, but the voices are far calmer than she expected.
They quietly tell of countless lives and deaths as Sarkaz.
The sigh of relief when drifting farmers finally find a land to settle on. The last pleas of Infected thrown alive to the furnaces.
The futile howl of dying soldiers forced to watch their city conquered. The helpless cries of hungry children lying weakly on their beds.
So many different upbringings and circumstances, all bestowed a tragic fate just because they were Sarkaz.
Their joy, their anger, the emotions amplified by the span of nine thousand years—
If this was what Theresa was always listening to... why?
Was it the myriad souls' will that the twin kings came to be again? Was it their will that sent the Sarkaz into this war?
The Sarkaz engrave their sorrows into the myriad souls, and the will of the myriad souls leads those who come after on a similar path. This is a tragic cycle.
Hate ignites hate. Sorrow reflects sorrow.
...Is that all?
W feels like she is being swept along by a rapid current.
Her life is also amongst the voices of the myriad souls.

Her voice is confident.
It is as though, here and now, or perhaps in the distant past... your emotions and memories had been tightly linked.
You are familiar with the symbol. Why a rhombus, though?
It exists everywhere in this 'universe', within Originium.
Most of the time, it hangs in the heavens, seemingly a harmless source of light. W and the others would not think much of an unusual 'star' in the sky.
But you know that this is not right.
If heaven and earth could be reversed... how could this 'star' be a planar figure?

Not an epic of heroic warriors protecting their home, nor a legend of a King of Sarkaz's reign.
Just a story of an ordinary Sarkaz girl, who lived a little longer than the ordinary person.
Born in Kazdel, she saw the few families and friends she had suffer in constant cold and hunger, trembling in fear in the darkness every night, waiting for the sun to rise again.
She wanted the people around her to live in happiness, to have a safe home. She would do anything for this.
She remained ever true to this wish.
