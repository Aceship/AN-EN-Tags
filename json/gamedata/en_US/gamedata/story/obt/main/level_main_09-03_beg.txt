[name="Horn"]I've already abided by strict process. I submitted description of my duty yesterday when entering County Hillock.
[name="Horn"]If the Colonel won't let us take part in suspect interrogations, and goes to lengths to execute them beforehand, and presently refuses my request to meet him—
[name="Horn"]To anyone else, don't you think this conduct might be taken as a deliberate hindrance to our fulfillment of orders?
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#7",name2="avg_npc_241",focus=2)]
[name="Victorian Soldier"]I have no authority to answer your question, Lieutenant.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_npc_241",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"]That's fine. I'll say my part, and it's enough if someone listens.
[name="Horn"]I've said before, the Originium products thieved are not small in number. It's sufficient arms to allow a detachment to attack a small town, or bomb a medium nomadic city's support tracks.
[name="Horn"]Who'd want to obtain these products?
[name="Horn"]Ordinary bandits wouldn't need them; it'd cost too much to smuggle them out. With Victorian military goods in this great a bulk, even a Sargon black market under Columbia's protection wouldn't dare provide a means for a deal.
[name="Horn"]Who else is left? A local private arms dealer, moneymaking off the costs of remodeling? They haven't got the appetite, let alone the guts.
[name="Horn"]Only a well-trained unit, well-versed in military methods would dare take it, and could evade our spies on top.
[name="Horn"]If this unit got hold of that large a quantity of Originium product, what would their goal be?
[name="Horn"]Conspiracy to overthrow? Taking the chance to embezzle far removed from Londinium, colluding with outside powers to fill their pockets, slowly and steadily?
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_npc_241",focus=2)]
[name="Victorian Soldier"]Lieutenant...
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_npc_241",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"]No need to panic, this is all just baseless reasoning, no thanks to whoever's keeping me waiting. I can't get anything done like this.
