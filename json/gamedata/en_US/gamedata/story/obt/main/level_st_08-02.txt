[Decision(options="...without crossing one of Talulah's elite squads?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] This is the problem with conspirators.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Take a warlord, or a tyrant of a devious king. Their strongholds are always easy to defend, hard to attack.
[name="Kal'tsit"] They know their own deeds will invite furious retribution without fail. They'll use superior strength and advanced armaments to deploy unyielding defense.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Yet, seeing as Talulah's despotic behavior is confirmed to be some kind of act, she would not do things this way.
[Decision(options="What makes you so confident?;......;I wanna hear your reasoning.", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Experience, theory, phenomena.
[name="Kal'tsit"] I have no confidence. I can only derive the facts.
[Predicate(references="2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] ...Truthfully, I'm hoping to see you ever offer your own opinion.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Or maybe you're already content with silence as a brand of opinion?
[name="Kal'tsit"] Then I thank you for your understanding.
[Predicate(references="3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] If my thought process was one that won your approval...
[name="Kal'tsit"] Did you think that I would thus feel some kind of happy?
[name="Kal'tsit"] Respect is a two-way street. If you value my point of view, and arrive at any useful conclusions, then I in turn will give your point of view serious consideration.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Talulah is maintaining her own image. She needs to have the normal Infected respect her, have the Sarkaz mercenaries obey her, have the guerrillas trust her, have the zealots worship her...
[name="Kal'tsit"] She needs to have the distance between her and them clearly visible, and have these people able to examine each other.
[name="Kal'tsit"] According to a series of behavior exhibited by Reunion so far, we can very clearly realize that Reunion's other leaders do not particularly recognize Talulah's conduct at all.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Even Patriot, seeing through to her scheme, had no power to reverse the tide in the middle of its change. If he could have killed Talulah, all the same, he still would have been unable to alter Reunion tending towards collapse.
[name="Kal'tsit"] To say nothing of the plot to exploit the Infected that Talulah has drawn up inside her own head... The time she would need likely far exceed the time Reunion has existed so far.
[name="Kal'tsit"] I conjecture that all of Reunion's actions up to now have been premised on a plan. Namely...
[name="Kal'tsit"] "Reunion will perish after all this is over.” 
[name="Kal'tsit"] Talulah will scatter keen, hidden forces across every part of her territory. When she needs them, she'll assemble them, and have them make their appearance at the right moment.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Doctor, I believe the Empire of Ursus's Third Army would not permit any Infected to act freely whatsoever.
[name="Kal'tsit"] However, Reunion's current conduct is all within the bounds of their tolerance. Superficial violence, lacking discipline and organization. The Third Army must be happy to see it.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Think about it carefully. Would they limit themselves to being onlookers? Thus, would they risk truly, willingly letting Talulah control a whole city—even a whole country's state of affairs?
[name="Kal'tsit"] Or perhaps, even this is one of the weights on Talulah's scales, used to swindle the Ursus military out of their power... having them hibernate somewhere, waiting until the situation is just about to move on from her control.
[name="Kal'tsit"] And then, in the truest sense, she'll be able to use... the power she could never even touch. Just as she wishes.
[name="Kal'tsit"] But that needs time.
[Decision(options="Now that you say all that, how is she not a tyrant?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Because while current Reunion wants that in a leader, it doesn't truly need that in a leader.
[name="Kal'tsit"] A tyrant treasures one's own enablers, even if a tyrant more often than not recklessly destroys them for lack of foresight or composure, and weeps truest, deepest tears for it.
[name="Kal'tsit"] A conspirator does not. The tyrant has chess pieces, and the conspirator does too; but the tyrant is with them on the chessboard, while the conspirator sits outside of it.
[name="Kal'tsit"] We can suppose she has humanity, and thus might make mistakes. But if we're talking about a qualified conspirator with a scheme on the tracks, then even if she herself died, her scheme would continue as a matter of course.
[Decision(options="Is our operation useless, then?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] If they were, we'd hardly be taking Rhodes Island's operators to hell and back.
[name="Kal'tsit"] The only thing naturally useless is killing her. So, in every part and every place, we must break down her plot, antagonize her instructions, and lead her scheme to failure.
[name="Kal'tsit"] If we cannot halt a landship's forward march, then we will tear it to pieces, and make it arrive at its destination no more than an empty carapace.
[name="Kal'tsit"] ...Ah, maybe I shouldn't have put it to you like that. Don't get me wrong, we still need to stop this Chernobog core city.

[name="Herdified Sarkaz Warrior"] Too much, pain.

[Character(name="avg_npc_091")]
[name="Herdified Sarkaz Warrior"] Will you, share our pain?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] No luck. Even if they weren't born in Kazdel, they should still have some kind of reaction to a hint of their native language. Their ability to actively think has been damaged.
[Decision(options="Could those words you were saying have any effect on them?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] They were meant to in the first place.
[name="Kal'tsit"] No, wait... this wasn't a common-sense idea. Don't get excited.
[name="Kal'tsit"] But if not even this lets me rouse their conscious, then they've already lost all capacity for thought, beyond simply their ability to express.
[name="Kal'tsit"] It means their brain's activity has been sealed off, or that their nervous system has been perturbed by the infected organs... either way, we don't have enough time left to ascertain the true answer.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Just based on what facts we have, it's not looking good.
[Decision(options="They don't seem like they'll attack us.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] They're preventing us from entering. Deeply infected Sarkaz mercenaries in this area number around six, and seem to spend most of their time set to an unconscious roam.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Their range of movement doesn't extend outside this passage. These severely Infected collected here only after they picked up on our activity.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Moreover, as long as we don't cross some boundary, they don't do anything further.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Reconnaissance operator. Can you detect our straight-line distance to the Sarcophagus? Determine position via the waveform I provided.
[name="Kal'tsit"] ...1.4km. Precise figure?
[name="Kal'tsit"] 1453m.
[name="Kal'tsit"] ...If my calculations aren't wrong, then the breakout of conflict between Reunion and Sarkaz special Infected happened to be roughly at distance 1.4km from the City Hall too.
[name="Kal'tsit"] We initially planned to enter the Sarcophagus holding from the City Hall basement shelter passage, but as things are, that exit's likely been occupied by Sarkaz special Infected of the same kind.
[name="Kal'tsit"] I have an unconfirmed conjecture, Doctor...
[Decision(options="What kind of conjecture?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] We don't know what their goal is, but these Sarkaz special Infected are likely preventing anyone else from entering the sarcophagus holding, and by happy coincidence, this district they've controlled measures 1.4km out.
[Decision(options="You might be right, but what about their goal, then?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] (Shakes her head)
[name="Kal'tsit"] At the very least, it's not the same goal these Sarkaz originally had.
[name="Kal'tsit"] ......
[name="Kal'tsit"] Poor Sarkaz, hailing from Kazdel. No matter where, they still become tools.
[name="Kal'tsit"] I believe there are similarities between the Infected and the Sarkaz's current situations. These Sarkaz here with us could only choose to well with hate, or to lose it all.
[name="Kal'tsit"] ...Things were meant to have changed. We have that power.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Those Teekaz who lost their homeland—have become Sarkaz, rootless as people.
[name="Kal'tsit"] And now, the Sarkaz before us can barely even be called people.
[Decision(options="How do you want to do things?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] All operators, inspect your hazmat equipment.
[name="Kal'tsit"] What we're facing may be a Class II Emergency Infective situation.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Doctor, in minimizing wear and tear to the utmost, we must halt the special Infected's activity to the utmost.
[name="Kal'tsit"] ...We haven't stepped in to resolve an Emergency Infective state for a while. This outfit looks entirely like Ursus's Infected Patrol Unit.
