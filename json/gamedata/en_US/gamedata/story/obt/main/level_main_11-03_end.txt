[name="Lt. Colonel Lettou"]Some unpleasantness always comes part and parcel, but this handover, out of this final set of factories, has been the smoothest.

Feist makes his way to a pipeline entrance.
He's done his survey. Somewhere along this passage is a connection to Sudean.
But now on the verge of setting foot inside it, he has doubts after all.
He wasn't kidding Patto. He's thought over every difficulty he might potentially face.
Critically, though, and what he never said, was that he didn't have a plan for every problem.
Granny wasn't wrong, after all. He's just a smith. He has a head that passes for smart, and relatively hardworking.
These two things ensured he could muddle through life fine in Londinium's peaceful years, but there's no telling if they'll save his life right under the Sarkaz's noses.
Tommy was right. If only those massive, hulking metal lads were still around.
He's all grown up, and still he's never seen a Steam Knight before.
