[name="Outcast"]And they're not stupid enough to point their cannons at a city block they finally managed to bring under their control. As if they'd blow up all the locals, their own men included.

[name="Outcast"]They know they can't win a war with the Tarans on the other side. With no way to tell friend from foe, they'll take them all down in one shot, even the common folks.
[name="Outcast"]And they used a dirty bomb precisely because it saves them the trouble later on. The Infected get rounded up, and that gives them the most righteous excuse to dispose of the Tarans.
[character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#4$1")]
