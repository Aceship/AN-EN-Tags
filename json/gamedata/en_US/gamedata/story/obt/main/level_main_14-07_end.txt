[name="Kal'tsit"]I do believe that to be true.
[charslot(slot="m",name="npc_10003_1",bstart=0,bend=0.8,focus="m")]
[name="Mon3tr?"]Why?
[name="Mon3tr?"]Is it the inheritance of memory that makes you so persistent? Memory can be easily tampered with and implanted. This, we know, for many long-lived beings have tried such methods.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_003_kalts_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Such 'immortality' is nothing but an empty lie.
[charslot(slot="m",name="npc_10003_1",bstart=0,bend=0.8,focus="m")]
[name="Mon3tr?"]Then, is it some kind of duty...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_003_kalts_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]I won't deny that my life has been duty-bound from the moment I was born.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_003_kalts_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Looking back, I don't think... I've ever truly been 'alive'.

[name="Mon3tr?"]The substances that make up your body have all been replaced. The memories inherited from your previous self are unreliable. The mission imposed upon you may not even be your own.
[name="Mon3tr?"]Kal'tsit, what is it that has kept the continuity of <i>you</i> across these thousands of years?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_003_kalts_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]A name.
[charslot(slot="m",name="npc_10003_1",bstart=0,bend=0.8,focus="m")]
[name="Mon3tr?"]A unique name, or a title? It is a question that so many emotionally deprived Sarkaz would be keenly interested in.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_003_kalts_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]This name, has many meanings.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_003_kalts_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]The person who gave me this name, and the people I care about, are now in danger. This isn't the time for us to be having this chat.
