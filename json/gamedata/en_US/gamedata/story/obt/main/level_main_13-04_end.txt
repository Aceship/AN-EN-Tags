[name="Delphine"]It's an old military tradition. And not a strictly Victorian one; it's the same in Kazimierz, Ursus, Gaul.
[name="Delphine"]The Infected are not allowed in camps. More conscientious commanders might put the Infected in their own unit, and send them on the most dangerous missions.
[name="Delphine"]But for the military, there's far too much uncertainty in the Infected and their uncontrolled Arts.

[name="Delphine"]No one ever succeeded. Looking back on history, the Infected make up a relatively small portion of armies in times of war. Acceptable losses in exchange for stability on the front lines.

[name="'Trilby Asher'"]First, let me make clear that the death of Her Grace Duke Windermere has nothing to do with the part of Victoria that I serve.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]In fact, I bring my sincerest condolences, Lady Delphine. My own position aside, I believe she glowed brighter than any hero in the Battle of the Four Emperors.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]But now, who will fill the gap that her death leaves behind? Who can step up to take her place in the grand strategic theater?
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]Duke Wellington is an accomplished soldier, but we all know he has no intention of giving his all.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]Duke Caster has her hands full coordinating everything. Frankly, the death of Duke Windermere is a big, big problem.

[name="Siege"]If it is a shelter for all, whether the son of a blacksmith or the daughter of a teacher, whether they take pay in the name of Victoria or carry weapons of their own making...
[name="Siege"]Then, by all means, you can have this piece of metal.
[name="Siege"]Come to me with the Stone of the Sword, Trilby Asher. I promise that I will never fall behind you on the front lines, not by a single step.

[name="'Trilby Asher'"]Can't do it for too long. Colleagues start getting suspicious, you know.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]...My grandmother was executed after getting Infected in the War of the Four Nations.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]When she left, she told me with a laugh that there was less than a three percent chance of getting Oripathy in battle. It was only when I inherited the title and looked through the records in the archives that I learned...
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]The three percent figure has been in use for centuries.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]It has never changed, even though we're using more Originium machines and more complex Originium Arts in modern warfare.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]Perhaps you haven't noticed because all you can see is a small corner of the battlefield. Certainly the dukes haven't noticed, because they have their sights set way too far away. But I have.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]The Infection problem in the Victorian Army is serious. Serious on an unprecedented scale.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]Everyone exercises restraint in a conflict between 'civilized' nations.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]No one wants their camp to be filled with ticking, living time bombs, or seize a dirty city covered in Originium dust.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]But now... our enemy is the Sarkaz.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]If you really mean to do this, Siege, then it has the potential to be a good thing for your reputation, for my career... perhaps, even for our country.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_112_siege_1#10$1",focus="m")]
