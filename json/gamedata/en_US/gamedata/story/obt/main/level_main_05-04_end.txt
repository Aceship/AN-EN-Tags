[name="Hoshiguma"]  All the Reunion members have been captured. None of them knew anything about the specific instructions...
[name="Hoshiguma"]  ...
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Ch'en? What are you looking at that has you so absorbed?

[name="Ch'en"]  Didn't this used to be University Road?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Hmm? Seems so. Its name was changed later.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I think this is where my home used to be...

[name="Hoshiguma"]  Wasn't your apartment in Tai Bo?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  This was the estate that belonged to my biological father's clan. Looks like it's been renovated. So much time has passed that I barely recognize it anymore.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Did you live here before studying abroad in Victoria?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Even though I've heard that both you and Mister Wei were born to Yen aristocrats, it's really quite astonishing to see a mansion this big.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Aristocrats? They were, but I'm not.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  But, your mansion here... How should I call it?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Hmm, the Ch'en Estate will do...

[name="Hoshiguma"]  Woah woah, isn't this your own house? Why'd you slice the door open?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  I forgot to bring the key. Besides, Reunion also just opened a hole along the side wall. They might have caused some unexpected damage.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  That doesn't mean you should— Ah, forget it. If you say so.

[name="Ch'en"]  He doesn't deserve to be my father.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Okay.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  If I remember correctly, you joined the L.G.D. right after you graduated from Victoria and returned to Lungmen.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I was living in the dorms at the time.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  So, you never returned here after that.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I have no lingering attachments to this place.

You shall receive no love from me, not in the slightest.

Sorry. I'm sorry, but I can't stand you. Just seeing you makes me want to peel my skin off my arms.

I cannot tolerate any of you. I am too selfish, but I can't live like this anymore.

One day, all of you will understand. If you hate me, so be it. Because I hate you too. And that's how it should be.

[name="Ch'en"]  What's going on? Why would they be after this? Have you lost your marbles as well?

[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  It's as you said. Maybe I did have a bit too much on my mind.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  That's right, according to the reports, Reunion is scattered throughout this entire area, and the forces we deployed earlier are driving them out.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  That's good. That makes our job easier, and we're getting closer to our goal.
[name="Ch'en"]  L.G.D., get into formation and move out! We're going to take back Lungmen!
