...One hundred and eighty-sixth day since making it back to Londinium.
Three more men joined us today. Two of them are seriously hurt. Only Robben is still able to fight.
In just this area, there are still at least seventy men in the enemy's hands.
With all of Londinium fallen, there is no telling how many soldiers have been captured.
I don't know whether they are still alive.
And I certainly don't know whether I should hope they are still alive.
Every day, someone who fought so hard to live leaves us forever. I try to remember the names of each and every one of them, but the truth is that by the time I meet these men, most of them can no longer speak.
I wish even just one more pair of ears could've heard their voices, and I wish... there could be someone here to hear my voice...
I hope you will one day see these records.
I hope your mission outside is successful.
I hope you won't be back in Londinium so soon...

[name="Mandragora"]My men had a little misunderstanding with your people down at the port.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1")]
[name="Manfred"]Misunderstanding?
[character(name="avg_npc_233_1#5")]
[name="Mandragora"]I... I'm here because I wanted to make sure... the cooperation between us still stands.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1")]
[name="Manfred"]Madam, let me remind you again. There are no concrete terms that we must follow for our cooperation to continue.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1")]
[name="Manfred"]Dublinn will not interfere with Sarkaz operations in Londinium. In exchange, we will allow you to remain in a demarcated area here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1")]
[multiline(name="Manfred")]You can take that as a..
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#6$1")]
[multiline(name="Manfred")]Tacit understanding, between the two of us.
[character(name="avg_npc_233_1#1")]
[name="Mandragora"]You told me, yes... and I haven't forgotten.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#9$1")]
[name="Manfred"]Right, and it doesn't matter if you have. We will consider the ruckus earlier a reminder.
[character(name="avg_npc_233_1#5")]
[name="Mandragora"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_233_1#1")]
[name="Mandragora"]Thank... you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1")]
[name="Manfred"]Don't be so quick to thank me. The Sarkaz are not as forgetful as you.
[character(name="avg_npc_233_1#5")]
[name="Mandragora"]What do you want me to do, then? Do you want my life? If that's what you really want...
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1")]
[name="Manfred"]If that's what I actually wanted, you would not have made it here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1")]
[name="Manfred"]Hmm... and you wouldn't have taken to the steps of Westhaleg those months ago, either.
[character(name="avg_npc_233_1#4")]
[name="Mandragora"]Er...
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#4$1")]
[name="Manfred"]What we want to see is a bit of sincerity from Dublinn.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#4$1")]
[name="Manfred"]And not the kind of 'sincerity' where you snatch a few Victorian soldiers from us or kidnap a couple Londinium citizens who escaped.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#5$1")]
[name="Manfred"]It's about time that... we actually cooperate.

[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] What's wrong?
[Character(name="avg_npc_422_1#1$1")]
[name="Victorian Soldier"] I didn't want to bother you, but Salley... he's not going to last much longer! His leg is so swollen that you can't even squeeze any more pus out...
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#2$1")]
[name="Horn"] ......
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] Is the 3rd back yet?
[Character(name="avg_npc_422_1#1$1")]
[name="Victorian Soldier"] No, things were a mess outside this morning. It might have delayed things for them.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] How many men do we have?
[Character(name="avg_npc_422_1#1$1")]
[name="Victorian Soldier"] Including the new blood, we have a total of seventeen who can fight.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] The 2nd will stay. High alert.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] I'll bring five men with me and pay the Dublinn's borrowed home a little visit.
[Character(name="avg_npc_422_1#1$1")]
[name="Victorian Soldier"] But... if you go back, what will you do if you run into Mandragora again?
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] Salley can't wait much longer.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] He needs medicine. Without painkillers and anti-inflammatories, he won't even make it through the afternoon.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] Do any of you have anything that's worth money? Hm? Old Ayton's been racking his brains just to figure out how to trade for enough food each day.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] If we don't take it from Dublinn, who are we supposed to turn to? The Sarkaz?
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] Or do you mean to ask the civilians for help? Have you given it any thought what the enemy will do to them if they offer us anything?
[Character(name="avg_npc_422_1#1$1")]
[name="Victorian Soldier"] *Sigh*...
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#7$1")]
[name="Horn"] Dejection won't buy us our friend's life.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#7$1")]
[name="Horn"] Pack it up. Bring any weapons we can use. We'll leave immediately.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1")]
[name="Horn"] Robben, you said you haven't killed enough of them, right? Lucky you. Your chance is here.
