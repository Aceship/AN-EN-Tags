[name="Shieldguard"]  The Ursus assholes are hiding amongst the Infected and the mercenaries! They are disguised as Reunion! Keep an eye out! 
[name="Shieldguard"]  Unless you see paint somewhere on their body, don't let a single one of them get away! If they even dare to take a step inside, kill them on the spot! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_059")]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  The Reunion folks are only here because they were talked into this mess! Do we really have to kill them?

[Character(name="avg_npc_090")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_059")]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Then what kind of firepower are they supposed to have?!! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"]  If we were able to give all of our mortar gunners the newest weapons, we probably could've taken the city down directly without the Catastrophe.
[name="Shieldguard"]  They don't care about covering their tracks anymore! They're trying to rush inside at all costs!
[Character(name="avg_npc_016")]
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  If that's the case, why didn't Talulah keep them close to her?
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"]  Because she's afraid! She's afraid we'd see through their identities and their plans! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_090")]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  Not even she would be able to cover everything up if there were too many people. Besides, those aren't the kind of weapons you can just pick up and take around. 
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  They probably had all those weapons stashed across the core city long ago just for times like these when everything falls apart!
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"]  They were designed to deal with us from the start! They want to kill all of us. But they're wrong! We will be the ones doing the killing today, not them!

[Character(name="avg_npc_016")]

[name="Rosmontis"]  Okay, in five seconds?
[name="Rosmontis"]  Four seconds, Phantom Crossbowmen. Get ready.

[name="Rosmontis"]  One.

[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]

[Dialog]
[Character]
There is a question that Guard has asked himself many, many times. He finds himself wondering this once again.
There are many operators in Rhodes Island with astounding powers, and, with those powers, they can easily influence the outcome of the battle. How should he look upon these formidable allies?
Once, he got an answer from Ace. He got another answer from Scout. And now he found yet another answer in Rosmontis.
As her massive swords begin to bear down on the enemy's artillery, and as the Sarkaz mercenaries begin to raise the crossbows in their hands, Guard can't help but yell out of his lungs:
[Character(name="avg_npc_059")]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Shieldguards! Shields up! Protect Rosmontis!

Together, they are a squad. They need to be protected, they need cooperation, and they need understanding.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  On the contrary, Ursus's wounds will become the wounds of others.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We cannot leave a struggle of pain simply be.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  There are some diseases that normal medical personnel cannot cure.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  All the things that the world imposed on them will only rain down on others several times over every now and then.
