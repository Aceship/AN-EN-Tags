This intelligence must be delivered.

She can foresee what will happen next.
The Shard's Catastrophe will severely damage the dukes' forces, and furthermore, said damage will be credited to not just the Sarkaz, but also to their respective rivals.
And once Victoria's storm-bringing prowess is drawn out into the open, any country across the lands will feel fear, and also fury.
Every seat of power will want to destroy this one, or possess it for themselves.
What if, at this timeâ€”the dukes guarding the borders slack on their duties because of their infighting?
Leithanien, Ursus, Kazimierz, and even the old Gaulish regions would never let this opportunity slip.
This is only the first flame.
Soon, an unstoppable blaze will sweep across the entire land.
Ines knows, there is still time, it's not too late.
As long as she can get the information outâ€”
A shadow approaches at the end of the corridor. It is not her own shadow, but the owner of this vessel.
Ines, who has heard rumors from her old partner about the revenant, is for the first time in her life glad that she isn't a real Sarkaz.
