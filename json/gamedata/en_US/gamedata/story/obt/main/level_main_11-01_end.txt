...Allerdale, it's no good habit to eavesdrop. Listen to your father, now.
Only lowly scoundrels would hide away in the dark to plot the demise of another.
Maybe they do it for their own benefit, but such stolen victories never last for long.

She doesn't want to be caught barefaced, especially not by these awful people. It'd disappoint her father, and bring shame on the Cumberland name.

She carefully, gingerly cowers inside the shadow. Her most loyal ally—the tremendous suit of steam armor—becomes her shield.
Her fingers feel to the edge of the window, and if she can just climb over and out, she can avoid this duo's line of sight, and climb down the gutter pipe.
Her skirt's filthy by now. Ailshie won't be happy about this.
But as long as she's not caught...

The sky and ground seem to spin before her eyes, the inside of Allerdale's head whirling with. Her hands and legs lose all purchase, her grasp and footing touch nothing but thin air. She plummets straight from the second story.
The garden scenery screams like mad towards her head, but before she hits the stiff soil, a soft yet ample cushion catches her.

They must have leapt out of a fairy tale just a moment ago, stood there imposingly in the garden. They really do exist.
Their golden fur gleams scintillant as the sun. The one at the head has pupils of deep brown, and they are now calmly staring at Allerdale.
Allerdale, brought by her father, has had several audiences with His Majesty, and seen generations of portraits of the Aslan kings hung on the palace walls.
But this is the first time she cannot help the urge to bow her head before such a gaze—for the ones before her seem more awe-inspiring than any monarch.

Yet a Cumberland does not bow so lightly. Allerdale makes a conscious effort to keep her head held high, as high as it can go, and only then does she notice that the one in the center carries a human astride him.
A girl who must be even younger than her, dressed in sumptuous ceremony, languidly sat atop his back akin to plated gold.
In his mouth is held a sword... a sword that outsizes the girl by far.
A deep, resonant voice arises in Allerdale's head.
