[name="Swire"]  Lin Yühsia, I think I misheard something. I misheard you, didn't I?
[Character]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  The L. G. D. has its business, and we have ours.
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  Wei Yenwu has you to keep order in Lungmen, and we are here to remove that which Lungmen does not need.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5")]
[name="Swire"]  You know what this team did in the slums?
[Character]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  They helped you deal with Reunion quite efficiently.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6")]
[name="Swire"]  That buffer zone was your father's blood, sweat, and tears!
[name="Swire"]  It's all thanks to him and his work in the slums that Lungmen is what it is today!
[Character]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  Do you know their objective?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6")]
[name="Swire"]  You've made it very clear. The slums are full of places for Reunion to hide, not to mention their invasion route. You'd level them!
[name="Swire"]  Isn't that right?
[name="Swire"]  We're working with Rhodes Island now. Reunion is no match for us! You don't have to do this!
[Character]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  Jumping to conclusions before I even have a chance to explain...
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  While Reunion is certainly no match for us, they're still not a problem for civilian forces to solve.
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  We must use the true power of our city to eradicate this threat. This is how I face the invaders.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5")]
[name="Swire"]  Why can't you put your faith in Rhodes Island and our own L. G. D.?
[Character]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  Why should we trust Rhodes Island? And why dirty the hands of the L. G. D.?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5")]
[name="Swire"]  What do you mean dirty...?
[name="Swire"]  Don't tell me you had no other choice. That's your father's land.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6")]
[name="Swire"]  It takes so much more to build than to destroy!
[name="Swire"]  Breaking a pane of glass takes one person one second... Do you know how long it takes to make one? How many people are involved?
[Character]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  Swire.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5")]
[name="Swire"]  Hm?
[Character]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  Do you know what it is the people fear? Do you know what it is that scares the chambers of commerce?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5")]
[name="Swire"]  What's wrong with you? Aren't we facing off against Reunion?
[Character]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  You really don't understand at all.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5")]
[name="Swire"]  Fine. Filthy rat... I don't understand. Might I humble myself and request that you grace me with an explanation?
[Character]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  The Infected... are growing in number. The people fear the Infected, and they don't care if they're Reunion or not.
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  In short, don't go looking in the sewers.

[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Your herd is shrinking.
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  The initial attack was ferocious and terrifying, but... We're not really sure why, but our scouts report their numbers aren't growing.
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Unfortunately, the group that suffered the most from this tactic was the Reunion squad that sustained the initial attack.
[Character(name="char_1507_Mephisto_1#3",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=1)]
[name="Mephisto"]  Who? Who did this? The L. G. D.? The L. G. D. could never suppress my herd!

[Character(name="char_1507_Mephisto_1#1",name2="char_1508_Faust_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Mephisto"]  And I'm glad to see how many of our people you've brought back with you. You'll put them to good use against the L. G. D. I'm sure?
[name="Mephisto"]  They won't attack us, but I can't control them. I've been wracking my brain over it.
[name="Mephisto"]  There aren't many left though.
[name="Mephisto"]  We will need more of our people to protect us. We must defeat those L. G. D.s if we're going to escape.
[name="Mephisto"]  Hm...
