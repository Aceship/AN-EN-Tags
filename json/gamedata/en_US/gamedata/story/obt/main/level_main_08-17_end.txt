Amiya, to me, dreams are something far out of reach. Ahh, it’s so tiring dealing with so many matters each and every day.
However, I do have a dream like that. This dream makes me think that no matter how much effort I put in here, it’s all worth it.
If your mom and dad were at your side when you slept at night, would you be a lot happier?
Yes, yes. Ehh, I know we may have conflict.
You might still throw tantrums knocking over furniture or being picky over dinner. Don’t give Kal'tsit a hard time, she doesn’t mean it. I know, child.
Yes, no matter what, we will always feel safer when our parents are by our side.
They are like a lamp shining bright in the darkness. They will chase away the monsters hidden in dark corners, the drooling beasts prowling outside the windows.
Do you miss them more? Ah, I...
It’s fine, it’s fine. It’s fine, Amiya. I’m here.
It will all be okay, Amiya. Your mom and dad must have thought so. No matter how many worries fill their minds, parents always think of more when looking at their children.
Sometimes, it’s the only reason for us to continue living. Because... life continues after we die, for no reason other than that others live on. That is the reason that helps us to move forward.
I do not wish for children to lose their parents, nor for parents to grieve over their children.
In this world of ours, people are always having their lives taken. Inevitably, something will take away the people we love, the people that give us strength to move forward...
Sometimes, these things even happen between parent and child. Just because of a few words, a few thoughts... Their relationship fills with hate.
The blood that flows from our wounds cannot irrigate the fields. The pain that builds up year after year will never bear fruit.
Amiya, we are weak. Even if our tears fall into the earth, seeds will not sprout there.
That’s why, I have a very distant dream.
I wish for the people of this world to never again cry tears of separation and loss. I don’t want our night skies to be filled with broken hearts and emptiness.
Perhaps, one day... We’ll be able to let everyone on this vast land fall into peaceful slumber.
Yes, everyone. Including us.
Even if that future will never come, even if this world should sink into darkness. Amiya, we live not just for a singular answer.
Right now, Rhodes Island is still trundling along its path. Everything is running as usual, even if we never reach our destination.
Good night and sweet dreams.

[name="Ch’en"]  Where did you get that key from?
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah"]  Heh... It was hanging on the wall in the brake control room. Anyone can use it as long as you know the command. It’s just nobody thought of it...
[name="Talulah"]  ...No one thought of such a ludicrous development and cruel deception.
[name="Talulah"]  To divert the guerrillas, to fool the L.G.D.... These keys were just a lie to trick them.
[name="Talulah"]  I made use of their unfamiliarity with the larger nomadic cities. I exploited the trust Skullshatterer and Patriot had for me, even though... that was the last time they trusted me.

[name="Ch’en"]  Or maybe she never considered it. Even if she thought to destroy everyone in a fit of rage, I don’t think she would’ve ever gone through with it.

[name="Ch’en"]  What is this? Didn’t you say it yourself? That you understood best whether you were being genuine or not, whether your words were coming from your heart or if you were just borrowing someone else’s mouth.
[name="Ch’en"]  You said this corrupt world was your enemy. Do you understand what that means, Talulah?
[name="Ch’en"]  No, you should know better than me!
[name="Ch’en"]  For the Infected——No, to break down the high wall that separates the Infected and non-Infected, to put an end to the ugly murders and wicked slavery.
[name="Ch’en"]  You who have fought alongside the Infected for so many years would have to know better than me!
[name="Ch’en"]  You know we can’t win against the world.
[name="Ch’en"]  You don’t have a ghost of a chance... They will oppress you, slander you, drown you, abandon you, deceive you!
[name="Ch’en"]  As long as you dare to stand out, they will drag you into the filthiest places and use the foulest methods to deal with you! 
[name="Ch’en"]  You will be knocked down if you make even a single mistake, yet your enemies are endless. You choose to move forward, to oppose them, to devote your life, but your enemies are immortal.
[name="Ch’en"]  There’s only one possible ending. You will be knocked down, you will be destroyed, even if you took just a single misstep!
[name="Ch’en"]  A single misstep would become an excuse for them to hurt you... a perfectly justifiable one.
[name="Ch’en"]  They would pounce onto you like beasts on the scent of blood, tearing at your flesh, ripping at your tongue and eyes as they howl insults at your dignity!
[name="Ch’en"]  But no one is perfect. You will be knocked down. You will fall to the ground.
[name="Ch’en"]  ...Even so, you cannot. You understand better than me that you cannot fall, Talulah...!
[name="Ch’en"]  Even if they are all staring at you! Even if they are all aiming at your weak points, even if they are planning to tear away your facade.
[name="Ch’en"]  Even if they want to drag you out to laugh and mock at, to insult you and call you an overambitious, immature fool...
[name="Ch’en"]  You cannot fall.
[name="Ch’en"]  ...We’ve grown completely unrecognizable to each other in the time we spent living in different cities. The past will not return.
[name="Ch’en"]  We both have our own undertakings.
[name="Ch’en"]  Right now, mine is still incomplete... so is yours.
[name="Ch’en"]  The road is still long.
[name="Ch’en"]  Because we still have things we need to do. It will be so, until the day we are done.
[name="Ch’en"]  You should understand better than me.

[name="Talulah"]  Who will be judging me?

[name="Talulah"]  I am not yet so pitiful that I would need my sister’s protection as I struggle in shame.

[name="Talulah"]  I don’t dare to die yet.
[name="Ch’en"]  You can... make amends.
[name="Talulah"]  Nothing I can do will make up for it. In the course of a single winter, I’ve destroyed countless people. I am in no position to make amends.
[name="Talulah"]  It’s just... I can’t die yet.
[name="Talulah"]  I can’t do that. It’s all over if I die. If I die, that means they’ve won. That means the names that only I remember will die along with me.
[name="Ch’en"]  You will continue living?
[name="Talulah"]  ——
[name="Talulah"]  Perhaps I don’t deserve to. However, I don’t deserve to die here either. I don’t deserve such an easy death.

[name="Talulah"]  It’s because I was bullied by the other kids in school.
[name="Ch’en"]  You were protecting Beatrix. So you got beaten up badly.
[name="Talulah"]  You weren’t the one who did it.

[name="Talulah"]  ...Just try it. You’ve become very competitive.
[name="Ch’en"]  Put the sword down. You look silly holding it.
[name="Talulah"]  Let’s all do that, then. By the way, are you using that Chi Xiao to fulfil your dream of being an adventurer?
[name="Talulah"]  “Good food, great wine and amazing scenery; Pretty women, good manners and great company”. Isn’t it like those weird novels you used to read?
[name="Ch’en"]  Hey! Shut up...!

[name="Talulah"]  Anyway, thank you.
[name="Ch’en"]  Thank her, not me.
[name="Ch’en"]  You should be thanking that brave little rabbit and all the Infected who fought alongside her.
[name="Ch’en"]  She was the one who braved your fire and flames to get all the way here. Amiya is the one who really saved you.

[name="W"]  His father told him about it before he died. He wasn’t a dumb man. He knew pretty much what Reunion was planning to do.
[name="W"]  But he couldn’t do anything about it. Just like how he couldn’t stop Ursus from killing his friends, and how he couldn’t keep his kids alive. Hah.
[name="W"]  At the time, none of us got it. I really only figured it out just now... That liar Kashchey really had us all fooled.
[name="W"]  Me, old man Patriot, FrostNova, Faust, Mephisto, Skullshatterer, Crownslayer, all of us were fooled.
[name="W"]  Misha didn’t need to die. I got her killed back there to keep Chernobog in place. Then when I couldn’t stop Chernobog, I really regretted that one.
[name="W"]  I thought my dumb bullshit was gonna get everyone killed. Thankfully that dragon lady still had a little bit of conscience left in her.
[name="W"]  I screwed up. Right, I won’t ask for forgiveness or anything. At the time, I didn’t think I was doing anything wrong. If everyone used common sense, the world would’ve died a long time ago.
