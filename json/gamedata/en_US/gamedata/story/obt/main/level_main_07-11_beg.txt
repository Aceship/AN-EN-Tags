[name="Kal'tsit"]  “Unimpeded?”
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The situation on the ground seems to be in line with our expectations.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Reunion has deployed the guerrilla fighters at hubs throughout the core city, and stationed Reunion regulars or Sarkaz mercenaries elsewhere.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It would be unwise to spread their defenses thinly across the entire map. They will gather their elites in a few key locations. That’s what I would do if I were leading Reunion.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Continued use of Originium Arts will cause you discomfort, and if the nausea becomes unbearable, you are to immediately take the supplement I formulated for you.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  ......
[name="Kal'tsit"]  A pharmaceutical company investigates the root cause of a problem, adapts to the environment, allocates functions appropriately, and looks for a breakthrough.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Our target is smaller and more precise than in a conventional battle. A small tactical assault team’s work is closer to a surgery than it is to a firefight.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  What the warmongers can’t do falls within our area of expertise. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Rhodes Island is going to take out the enemy command in the core city. All our objectives center on rooting out the cause of this disease.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But even if we excise the cancer, if the cause of the problem remains unknown to us, it will not be fundamentally solved.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Dr. {@nickname}, I do hope you will give this due consideration.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  —Who are our patients?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The normal Infected? The Ursus who were Infected? Reunion? Or this city?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And where is the cause of this disease?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We’ve discussed how Reunion is not maintaining the city’s communication networks.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It has become clear that Talulah deliberately kept Originium clusters from the Catastrophe in the city to maintain a state of chaos.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That will massively disrupt our communications.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Even our most advanced equipment will not function under these conditions.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But now, thanks to elite operator Raidian, we can make use of the otherwise chaotic airwaves.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That leaves us with a direct, reliable method of communication, and a tactical advantage.
[Decision(options="One advantage isn’t enough.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  True.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You saw the runners carrying megaphones. The guerrillas use these antiquated methods to carry intelligence and orders in encrypted messages.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We have yet to properly map the movements of these runners, but Rosmontis is working on it.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Their transmissions may not be instantaneous, and are limited in range, but it is the most stable and disciplined method in a hostile environment.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Correct.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Now we’ve focused our thinking. This is another tactical advantage. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ......
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Doctor, the Arts Rosmontis is releasing will show us the location of every runner and their patrol routes.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  She will expand her consciousness and capture every physical structure within range. At the same time, her mental state will grow increasingly chaotic.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Amiya is working to flatten those emotions.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Raidian is the core of our communications. With her Arts, we can communicate unimpeded for a short period of time.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We just need to wait for Rosmontis to finish her part, then we go.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  For now, the guerrillas know nothing about us.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  They are completely unaware that we are targeting their communications, or that we are able to work against the ancient Sarkaz witchcraft..
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We do have our methods, limited as they may be.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  After striking the runners, the guerrillas will respond. Within a half hour, they will have new runners working, and they will be hardened against further attacks.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  They will be on high alert, and may not have weaknesses to exploit.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  What’s more, we will have exposed our positioning and tactics, putting us in a difficult situation.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  However, we only need to execute a single surgical strike. With that one blow, we will force out their command unit.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The guerrillas won’t be expecting another Infected spec ops team.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...Rosmontis was born in a lab.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  She did not suffer the same tragedy as most experimental Infected. She did not die from the increasingly cruel experiments. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  As the project moved forward, she gradually crushed the entire facility.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The lab did not destroy her, she destroyed it. Her Arts are tied to her mental state.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The group that found her and smuggled her to Rhodes Island has made it clear that “Rosmontis does not exist.”
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I know what you’re thinking. And no, through force or coercion, I would never allow an individual who has been through that to become an operator.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But Rosmontis herself chose responsibility, training, and companionship.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  With her subconscious Arts usage causing constant damage, the caster operators decided to train her. She had to mature faster than the others, which she fortunately wanted to do.

[Decision(options="Don’t keep me in suspense.;...Elaborate.;I don’t quite understand.", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Then let me finish, please.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  They are alike in that they will both fight to the end for other people.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  As for how they’re different—
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You know Amiya has never wanted to make enemies. Even when forced to do so, she fights back her tears, reluctantly destroying her enemies.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But Rosmontis, I could say, Doctor, that Rosmontis...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  She’s never given up on a mission. Faced with any situation, she handles it appropriate, and wins.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That is our simultaneously reasonable and incomprehensible Annihilation Specialist, Rosmontis.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  She is an elite operator for no other reason than she met the standards across the entire battery of tests.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The operators who feared her came to know what she was really like and ultimately put their lives in her hands...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Because she protects them, with all her power.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If Blaze won the respect of our people through leadership of her team, Rosmontis fought for their respect.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  She heard their expectations, and exceeded them.
[Decision(options="But there are practical considerations to her participation here.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  There are other operators with detection Arts similar to Rosmontis’s, with different casting conditions.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Rosmontis can do more than just locate, you’ve seen the way she fights.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Dr. {@nickname}, we allowed Rosmontis to join this op because she is the best operator for the job, and because she believes as much herself.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Her Arts are also enough to help Amiya and I face the leader of the guerrillas...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  “Patriot, of Reunion.”

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Then we’ll go to #4 Secondary School, Doctor. Move.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  ......
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Precisely.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Rosmontis, Amiya, and I will deal with the runners. And you...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Dr. {@nickname}, you will command our free units and slow the guerrilla fighters.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Remember, we target only the enemies we can target.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Once the guerrillas regroup, we fall back. We are here to complete our objective, not to entertain some fantastical idea of a direct fight.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  This will be a protracted battle. We could suffer casualties, or even total defeat.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If that happens, we could be facing a new dark age for the Infected.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The best possible outcome for us could be that the command squad does not appear.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We head straight for the command tower and the generator area, leaving the Reunion Infected to handle their own problems with the Infected.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But he won’t, not this guerrilla commander.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  He won’t lose control of the battle and watch his team fall apart. It is not faith alone that keeps his people together, he has the strength to live up to his name.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  After this battle, if all goes well... we will commit everything to a conflict with their command squad.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We will face down Buldrokkas'tee.
