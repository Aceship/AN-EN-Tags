Londinium's wall is falling down.
And so she endlessly falls too.
[name="Horn"]I... I did it.
[name="Horn"]Until... you all left...
[name="Horn"]...I did not fall.
Her blood flows out, and she almost loses the last speck of awareness she has.
But her body is as if a part of her sword and shield at this point, harder than steel, unbending unless shattered.
The weapon forged by Victoria still stands upon Londinium's wall.
So the soldier She tempered to fruition keeps her watch upon it too.
Until a corner of it crashes to its city's ground—
And she returns to the land that raised her.
