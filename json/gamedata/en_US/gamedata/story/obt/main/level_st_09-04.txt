The silent warrior stops in her tracks.
Amid the vast white blanket brought forth by the Ursus winter, the abandoned stronghold is almost entirely covered in snow, leaving not a trace of its former appearance.
Even Talulah finds this strange. It is as though she can see those scenes unfolding before her. She can immediately tell where the campfire used to be.
The walk was difficult, but the team was as hardened as they could have been. The soldiers once gathered here to sing together and warm their ever-starving stomachs with a soup that had only a hint of salt for taste.

The Draco begins to walk in silence. Her footsteps alone remain on the white snowfields. With each step on the thick snow, the mud below is imprinted with her weight.
Talulah walks tall with her back perfectly straight.
Aside from that one winter, when the slowly fading warmth behind her drained her of breath, she has never once slouched her back.
The names etched on the crude cenotaph appear to have been scrubbed often; they are starting to fade.

It feels as though only a brief moment has passed. At the same time, it also feels like an eternity, to the point that the world itself falls still, and that the weight of emotions falling on the mud amidst the snow can only be borne by the land.
From afar, the warrior appears as both a solemn statue and a tree growing in the snowstorm.
Her roots must dig deep into the earth. Her figure can only expose itself above the snow ever so slightly. Beneath the hidden soil, the massive roots trickling out of the Draco continue to expand and steadily take hold.
At this moment, even the silence itself is engulfed by the snowstorm.
The warrior raises her head. A snowflake flutters downward onto her cheek, dried up before it can dissolve.
The snow ended long ago, in actuality. It's hard to believe that the northern wind granted her this bit of kindness, with the clouds dispersed and the sun shining down brightly.
The weather is fine today. A rare occurrence here in the tundra.
