Darkness. Tranquility.
Amidst the pitch-black dark, a singularity emits its first ray of light.
The light of thought. The light of emotion. The light of rebirth.
The ray of weak, reddish light begins to grow and expand.
Illuminating the hand that wrought it.
Illuminating—

She walks forth from the darkness... No, she has been there all along.
It is just that for a moment, she chose to let her gaze fall upon you. For only a moment.
Within her embrace, the revenant's scattered consciousness coalesces once more.
All his sorrow. All his misery. All his rage.
They dissipate as she consoles him, and at last, the revenant returns to serenity.
She carries her compatriot, abandoned by death as he is. She brings rebirth. She rewrites fate.

There is no response, but you manage to glean some curious information from her expression.
You dare not say for sure.
Everyone holds their breath because of her presence. Everyone awaits the first words out of her mouth.
Silence.
She says nothing, retreating back into the gloom.

It all happens in a flash of lightning.
Theresa does not reappear, having gathered up the shadows and taken them with her.
As you approach the Cunabula of Suffering, the crystallization advances ever more rapidly.
Now that the tides of shadow have retreated, you finally notice that the crystals have covered the entirety of the airship.

The instant that the ship is about to touch Amnannam, the colossal vessel, once hurtling at full speed, is slowed to a crawl.
Time itself stagnates.
The great Originium tree rapidly grows new limbs, firmly grasping the airship.
The lush branches quickly extend and envelop the ship.
You see everyone trapped in that moment.
You see the Originium grow wildly.
You see Amiya anxiously stretch her hand out towards you.

This was the moment that time stopped for her. You can even see her shouting your name.
But pure Originium covers her body at a terrifying speed, and the words never manage to leave her mouth.
It spreads.
You rush towards her, but you are nowhere near fast enough.
It engulfs.
You see the Originium about to swallow up the final dregs of her body.
Amiya!
You muster all your strength to extend your hand, trying to grab hold of hers... but you are too late.
You are no longer able to take hold of her hand.
A torrent of jumbled information rushes into your mind.
It is like you are seeing a tranquil world, one completely turned into Originium.
