Vina could never forget that voice, even if she can on longer make out all the information it contains.
But, her intuition tells her... that it is a name. A name that is associated with her entire life.

Slash. Pierce. Charge.
The suit of armor fights valiantly, and ferociously.
The path behind him is soon littered with Sarkaz corpses and the fragments of shattered altars.
Witchcraft missiles fall at his feet, crossbow bolts fly towards him, blades slash at his body.
But, he never stops. He cleaves apart the next enemy, sweeping them away, along with any traces they left on him.

The longsword left her hand, cutting through the air as countless eyes followed its path.
Vina never looks back. She simply continues running, carefully listening to every last sound.
Swoosh.
The sound of metal vibrating through the air. The sound of air being cut apart by a sharp object.
She forcefully throws down the hammer in her hands. Its massive head lodges into the cliffside, creating a tiny foothold for her.
She steps on it, and leaps. And when she extends her hand, the Sighs of Kings has already found its way into her palm.
[name="Siege"]Indra, Morgan, remember how we used to chuck Molotov cocktails down the chimneys of the nobles?

The Originium beneath her feet feel like alive, unlike any wall or mountain she's ever traversed before.
How much farther?
How much longer will it be until the dark clouds disperse, and the war draws its last breath?
She fled Londinium to the land beyond its walls; then from there, she returned. How much farther must she go... before she returns to her peaceful homeland, and to the people she loves?
Vina does not know. But at least, the Stone of the Sword is right before her eyes. She extricates her hammer with all her might.
She knows what she must do.
She leaps up, hammer and sword held high in her hands, glimmering in the sunlight.
