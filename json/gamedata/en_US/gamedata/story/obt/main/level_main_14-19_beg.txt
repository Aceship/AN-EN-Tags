The sound of electrical static, then the same voice is heard over all communications channels on the Victorian side.
[name="Static-Filled Radio"]Attention all soldiers of the alliance. This is the Duke of Caster, in command of the Glorious.
[name="Static-Filled Radio"]You see as I do how the Sarkaz tyrant has torn our motherland apart.
[name="Static-Filled Radio"]The malice and barbarism of our foe merely serves to strengthen our resolve to defend our country.
[name="Static-Filled Radio"]As long as our ships and soldiers... *Bzzt*... as long as we all do our duty...
[name="Static-Filled Radio"]This is the resolve of Parliament—and every citizen, duke or commoner, general or soldier... *Bzzt*...
[name="Static-Filled Radio"]Our foe climbs the broken bow of the Glorious once more. Originium threatens to devour our fortress.
[name="Static-Filled Radio"]But you have not yielded, brave soldiers! Neither will Caster!
[name="Static-Filled Radio"]...*Bzzt* I shall step up to the frontlines and stand with you... *Bzzt* ...
[name="Static-Filled Radio"]We stand upon Mother Victoria—

Even the frightened soldiers in the rear heard the unusual sound from the Glorious.
The armor patrols the Stone of the Sword, trampling every Sarkaz who attempts to approach it.
But he could contain the spread of Originium.
'Victoria!!'
He roars, he smashes the ground, but there is nothing he could do to stop the Originium from swallowing the Realmblade—
And so he charged at its foe, towards the Glorious devoured by Originium.

But she could not say anything, ask anything.
Theresa would not permit it.
