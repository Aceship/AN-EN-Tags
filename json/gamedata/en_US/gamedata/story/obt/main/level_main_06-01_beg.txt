The Year 937
Duke Erik and Professor Lierland D. of Piesberg Parliamentary University published this co-authored paper in The Journal of Urban History ("Where Did We Come From?" Issue 44).
The paper discussed the results of a detailed analysis of a collection of weathered remains.
The investigation into Sargon Excavation Site 4 revealed a common origin for Infected quarantines and executions with the law itself.
......
That is to say, the suffering of the Infected predates even the emergence of the law.
