[name="Damazti Cluster"]Not as long as you think. Can we skip the boring work talk, though?
[name="Damazti Cluster"]It's break time right now. We want to do something that we are truly interested in.
[name="Damazti Cluster"]For exampleâ€”
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_426_1#10$1",focus="r")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]We want to know what you think about this era, and your conclusions around all this.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_647_1#10$1",focus="l")]
[name="Golding"]I don't understand.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_647_1#3$1",focus="l")]
[name="Golding"]You... You used me to destroy the Self-Salvation Corps. I should have no more value to you anymore.
[name="Golding"]I... Damn it! I handed all this out myself...
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Don't blame yourself. This is no big deal at all. We had all kinds of ways to locate the Self-Salvation Corps' stronghold. You are not the only lead we have.
[name="Damazti Cluster"]This may sound a little hurtful, but you aren't even the most important one.
[name="Damazti Cluster"]But we do indeed have a little bit of interest on you. We enjoyed your work and chatting with you.
[name="Damazti Cluster"]So, let's have a chat together. There is nothing more to this. It's just a conversation.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_426_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]We've had conversations like this many times. With countless of identities. With countless others.
[name="Damazti Cluster"]But we are still confused. We still don't want to give up any chances that could lead to an answer.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_426_1#10$1",focus="r")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Lady Golding, how do you thinkâ€”
[name="Damazti Cluster"]â€”we should live?
