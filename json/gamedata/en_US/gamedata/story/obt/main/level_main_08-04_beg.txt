Hui-chieh:
If memory serves me correctly, and I don't trust it to, the old man's name was Ivan Iziaslav.
A very common name. And he was the sort of peasant farmer you could find anywhere. 
But he sacrificed himself. For a whole mess of reasons, he gave his own life... 
I think about it every now and then. Am I truly worth people sacrificing their lives?
Alina went with me. She was gentle most other times, but would suddenly just come out with venomous tongue-lashings. That made me uncomfortable, to say the least. 
The plan was proceeding smoothly.
In accordance with my own ideas, rapidly, the Infected of this place would surely unite as one.
I hoped it would be effective.
And I hoped it would be enough for the old man to rest peacefully. Aside from the old lady, no-one else had been closer family to me.

[name="Talulah"] Sir, I'm...
[Character(name="avg_npc_094",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected"] Whatcha here for? Don't like the look of your clothes. Some old vet, are you? 
[name="Infected"] Get lost! There's nothing even left here. You lot stole it, all of it! And what you couldn't steal, you burned!   
[name="Infected"] Bastards! You came to kill me? Kill me, then! Goddamned demons!
[Character(name="avg_npc_094",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] No, sir, I'm here to tell you that the Infected Patrol Unit is sweeping this area today.
[Character(name="avg_npc_094",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected"] Then let 'em sweep! Let 'em kill us all, why don't you!
[name="Infected"] We built our pathetic, unlivable village all the way out here, and they still come for us! What else can we do but let 'em!? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_078")]
[name="Talulah"] Sir. You can hide yourselves, and I'll talk to them. Or I can conceal myself... 
[Character(name="avg_npc_094")]
[name="Infected"] And who're you? I always said, you military noble bunch, no matter what you pretend! You're all just out for our lives—  
[name="Infected"] Hah, you're not quite their sort. You actually talk with us! And they think we're barely even worth whipping! 
[name="Infected"] Huh? Hello?
[name="Infected"] Gone...?
[name="Infected"] What kind of stunt is this? Oh... damn us all...
[name="Infected"] Damn us all. What a pathetic ending.

[Character(name="avg_npc_078")]
[name="Talulah"] I am.
[name="Talulah"] I can think. I can speak.
[name="Talulah"] We Infected live and die. Why should you decide when and how?

[name="Infected Patrol Unit"]  What is this bullshit?!

[name="Talulah"] They want to decide our fates. Control us. Perhaps our lives aren't worth much, but do you think you'd be worth a single gold coin?
[Character(name="avg_npc_082")]
[name="Infected Patrol Unit"]  You!
[Character(name="avg_npc_078#4")]
[name="Talulah"] You're not worried that the Infected will hurt anything. No. You've hardly met more than a few remotely threatening Infected in your whole life.
[name="Talulah"] All you want to do is exploit us to our last days, make playthings of our lives!
[Character(name="avg_npc_094")]
[name="Infected"] Ah...!
[Character(name="avg_npc_078#4")]
[name="Talulah"] My brother, in all their past outrageous acts, have they ever spared someone for their conduct? Have they ever let another live for following instructions?
[Character(name="avg_npc_078#5")]
[name="Talulah"] They have not! Each time they let you live, it was only because they still saw worth they could squeeze from you!
[name="Talulah"] With no money and no land left, they'd kick you to the floor. After all, the cities don't even give Infected the chance to live!
[name="Talulah"] How should we Infected live? How should we die? That is for us to decide!

[Character(name="avg_npc_082")]
[name="Infected Patrol Unit"]  You good-for-nothing! Tell me your name at once!
[name="Infected Patrol Unit"]  In the name of the Emperor! For daring to lead his citizenry astray with these ludicrous ideals, we sentence you to death!
[Character(name="avg_npc_078")]
[name="Talulah"] To my brothers, I have no name. Refer to me how you wish. If you must call me something, you may call me Talulah.
[name="Talulah"] To my enemies, you have no need for my name.
[name="Talulah"] But my fires will set you alight.
