[name="'Shopkeep'"]Your Highness, please, I beg of you, help her! A-And, Lord Banshee, sire, I humbly return this coin to you. It is the only thing of worth I have.

[name="'Shopkeep'"]Then what are you going to do? Don't tell me you're going to kill her like you killed those red worms?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1338_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="'Driver'"]Stand aside, Shopkeep. This was my decision.
[name="'Driver'"]Your Highness, I heard that... in the past, the greatest warriors of the Sarkaz, right before they died, could request that the King grant them a vision.
[name="'Driver'"]I don't know if *cough* if I count or not.

Amiya raises her hand.
Black Arts coalesce at her fingertips.
A desperate smile emerges on the Driver's face as she unconsciously looks at the top of the Cautus's head, searching for the legendary Black Crown.

[name="'Driver'"]My... King...
[name="'Driver'"]What will I see? I just hope... it won't be me driving that piece of junk around Kazdel, haha.

[name="Amiya"]Driver, can you tell me your name? Your real one.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1338_1#1$2",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#17$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]Well... If I knew your name, it would be a lot easier.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1338_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="'Driver'"]...Maryla. A common name.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#17$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"](Kazimierzian) Maryla.
[name="Amiya"]Sorry, I never stayed in Kazimierz for long, so my pronunciation might be off.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1338_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="'Driver'"]No, it's good. It's been so long since anyone called my name so gently, ever since my mother died.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#17$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]Maryla, I refuse your request.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1338_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="'Driver'"]You won't grant me a vision? I suppose... I was never a warrior to begin with.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#17$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]No, that's not it. I refuse to let you die here, by my hand, Maryla.
[name="Amiya"]You have not become the Vampire's creation.
[name="Amiya"]Your looks have changed, but I don't sense you becoming any more evil or bloodthirsty.
[name="Amiya"]And even if you are showing a bit more of your ancient bloodline, you're still you.
[name="Amiya"]You do not deserve punishment, nor should I be the one to give you your honor.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1338_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="'Driver'"]But you are the King of Sarkaz...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#21$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]Please, call me Amiya.
[name="Amiya"]Miss Maryla, I've had my share of worries because your team, er, isn't comprised of Rhodes Island operators.
[name="Amiya"]I was thinking earlier about how we could get along with you three. But in truth, it wasn't a problem at all.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#16$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]If you wish to fight alongside us for our common goal, then I welcome you with open arms.

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_003_kalts_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]It is deepening the Sarkaz bloodlines' bond with Originium... with Amnannam.

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_003_kalts_1#3$1",focus="l")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]The strength of the Sarkaz bloodlines acts as a direct catalyst to the Originium’s spread. In turn, the information within Originium empowers the bloodlines, changing their powers and other traits.
