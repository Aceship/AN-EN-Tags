[name="Amiya"]  I have to cleanse it... the poison of Mephisto's hate.

[name="Ch'en"]  I've finished mopping up the Reunion stragglers and reached the waypoint. But we've found the situation in the slums is not what we expected.
[name="Ch'en"]  The L. G. D. unit guarding the area found no traces of Reunion. I'm going to have to investigate myself.
[name="Ch'en"]  There's been a reduction in the Infected mutants? Is that your doing?
[name="Ch'en"]  No?
[name="Ch'en"]  Stay frosty... You never know what danger might be hiding in the shadows.
[name="Ch'en"]  Don't let your guard down. These Infected are a lot more to handle than your run-of-the-mill Reunion.
[name="Ch'en"]  Once I finish my work here, I'll send a team to assist you. Keep the channel open. Over and out.

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  It's me! Reporting in!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Not you...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  Huh...?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Nothing. Report in.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  Yes, Sir! As ordered, we swept the area!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  What did you find?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  Nothing! Not a single Reunion footprint to be found!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I told you to be on the lookout for anything unusual!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  Oh... Oops. We really don't know this area at all.
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  I mean, according to procedure, we don't come in here until there's a problem so serious we have to tear down a block or something.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I know... The slums don't exist to you, as long as they're quiet.

[name="Ch'en"]  When we cut off Reunion, there was a deafening sound coming from this place, and half the residents here vanished.
[name="Ch'en"]  Look at the toys scattered around our feet... Look at this and tell me there's nothing out of the ordinary.
[name="Ch'en"]  Was there anything in the plan about evacuating all the residents of the slums?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  ...There are a few things out of the ordinary. Most of the buildings in the district have been abandoned or otherwise ruined.
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  The streets that are still here are completely empty. Presumably a result of crossfire between Reunion and the locals.
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  And there have been a few fires. We have extinguished them. They seem to have been caused by household functions such as heating and cooking.
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  All buildings show signs of forced entry, but there is no trace of any resistance from the residents.
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  As for Reunion, there's really no sign of them at all. Just... some cleaning residue.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Do you care nothing for the civilians here?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  ...Sorry, Sir!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  What are you apologizing for?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  I don't know, Sir!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Whatever... Why should you care about anyone in a place like this?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Hurry up and send out some teams to lock down the area!
[name="Ch'en"]  No one gets in or out. No vehicles either. Reunion or otherwise!
[name="Ch'en"]  As for you... You come with me. We're going north.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  Yes, Sir!

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Officer"]  But, Sir...

[name="Ch'en"]  Go!

[name="Ch'en"]  Who sent you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="???"]  I do not answer to you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  You think you can run? Try and I'll arrest you on the spot.
[name="Ch'en"]  You're an unidentified armed element of unknown origin. How do you think the L. G. D. is going to treat you? We might just shoot you dead.
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="???"]  Training a new L. G. D. unit would be a waste of Lungmen's time, treasure, and talent.
[name="???"]  And eradicating the entire L. G. D. would be a crushing blow to the heart of the Lungmen community. You should not take the risk.
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Hah! Is that threat supposed to scare me? Or should I be thanking you for your concern over Lungmen's future?
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="???"]  Ch'en, the L. G. D. is the face of Lungmen, as well as a pillar of her community, and an exemplary show of her strength.
[name="???"]  And the L. G. D. should stay in its lane.
[name="???"]  Don't let it stick its nose where it doesn't belong.
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Your threats are really not impressing me. Hurry up and answer the question: where did all the locals go?

[name="???"]  ——
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  You're one tap of this "alert all units" button away from making an enemy out of the entire L. G. D. 
[name="Ch'en"]  Or I guess you could take a split second to knock away my sword, slice off my arm, and snatch away this transceiver. 
[name="Ch'en"]  Where did all the slum dwellers go?
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="???"]  We will withdraw from this place. Ch'en, you and I both withdraw. For now, let us not interfere with one another.
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  And where is it you think you're going?
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="???"]  These new-type Infected Reunion is controlling may well interfere with our carefully laid plans.
[name="???"]  We will swiftly remove them for the L. G. D., please do your part to exterminate Reunion's main force.
[name="???"]  If the L. G. D. seeks to actualize its strategic goals, it should focus on its own duties. You must do that which you must do.
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Wait! You think you can just leave?
[name="Ch'en"]  Come and go as you please?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="???"]  Superintendent Ch'en, let me give you a suggestion.
[name="???"]  Do not seek to investigate what has happened here. I look to Lord Wei, and will banter with you no longer.
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  ——!
[Character(name="avg_npc_038",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="???"]  By the way, cutting off your arm is quite simple. When you stand resolute, you are a hundred times stronger than now.

[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6",name2="char_010_chen_1#2",focus=2)]
