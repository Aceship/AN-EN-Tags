Ines often says death is also a tool.
She would sometimes joke to Hoederer that she might be getting a little too used to playing dead.
But now, as she stands on death's door, Ines realizes that she feels calmer than she expected.
She closes her eyes.
A blaze abruptly bakes her face, along with an intense shockwave.
The unique smell of the explosives is well familiar to Ines.
Her lips curl up.
Dust and smoke from the explosion engulfs her with embers still retaining the heat of the flames.
These embers gather, dance, and weave together.
Sarkaz history is woven of embers, but occasionally, other things are knitted from the smoldering remains.
For example...
Ines falls head first into a cushiony cloud of smoke and dust.
A giant web of embers holds her aloft.

[name="Damazti Cluster"]We're thirsty.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]And to offer a greeting to the little King of Sarkaz here.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]That banshee speaks pretty highly of you.

[name="Amiya"]It's alright, Doctor. I've never seen our guest here in their current form, but... I know them very well, they've appeared frequently in those histories.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]But they're always wandering outside the Royal Court, and they're not interested in anything... except themselves.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]Damazti fragment, why have you appeared before us?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]So you really are a genuine King of Sarkaz, little bunny.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]That thing seems to have also tormented you quite a bit. Good job holding all that in your little head while not being a Sarkaz.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Memory is the most precious thing to us, but it can sometimes also be our poison.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]So you see, we do appear to have something to talk about.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]Are you... also of the opinion that I'm not worthy of bearing the crown of 'The King of Sarkaz'?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]I see that talkative revenant really put you through the wringer.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Don't mind it, he's never been the kindly type.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]You're an ancient Sarkaz, so how do you think... a King should act?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Oh, good question. We've never been one, and we don't care to bother...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]But we're thinking, you should at the very least be strong enough?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Strong enough to... overcome any hesitation or doubt, yes?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Oh, we're certain of something else though. You definitely shouldn't be asking us this question, little King.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]You have a long path ahead of you, regardless of whether you're leading the organization you call Rhodes Island or following the guidance of the Sarkaz souls.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Oh, sorry. We forgot that the souls won't accept you, just like how they won't accept us.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]We're all different from each other.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]However—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]You'll understand at some point in the future, that the passage of time is unbeatable. The Kings of Sarkaz in our memories, all walked the very same path in the end.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]Not me.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_394_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]I—refuse to walk that path.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Don't be too quick to refute us, Cautus. We did think it was a nice change having a young King of Sarkaz, but it seems like you're still chained to your fate.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Though we're nonetheless full of expectations for you, a non-Sarkaz King...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]A young King of Sarkaz who is still growing and questioning her own blood...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]A never before seen King of Sarkaz...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_395_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Ascalon"]What are you up to?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]We... have no ill intentions.
[name="Damazti Cluster"]King of Sarkaz, we don't dare to claim that we're wiser than you are, and we have nothing to teach you either.
[name="Damazti Cluster"]We only wish to extend an invitation, we seek an opportunity to thoroughly understand a 'unique' individual.
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Ascalon, you will understand when you've lived as long as we have.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_426_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Damazti Cluster"]When something you've never seen before appears right before your eyes, how could you resist reaching out to it?
[name="Damazti Cluster"]O King of Sarkaz, please grant our perennial lives a pleasant surprise.
