[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  That’s right. We mostly brought defense equipment, but I never expected that they’d shred through our steel cables and polyfiber nets like paper. We might have to bring in some military-grade weapons.
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  We’re at our limits here, so we had no choice but to ask for backup from the landship. Thankfully, now that you’re here, we might be able to turn the tides.
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  The Originium structure inside makes their bodies incredibly tough. We use suppressing fire to keep them under control. Also... our scans aren’t picking up any signs of brain activity at all.

[name="Hoshiguma"]  I can’t. No way. It moves too fast. That chase has crushed so much of what I cared about.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  This is all I have left. A yellowed splotch, a tear, a dog-eared page. I've got names for 'em all.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  And it sucks. I hate how time took all these people from me.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  They died horrible, miserable deaths, sacrificing themselves to try to find a place in this world. But me?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I simply watched them all vanish into dust. Some of them? I smashed their dreams to pieces with these very two hands.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  They didn’t love Lungmen. They simply had nowhere else to go. And in the end, that was my fault.

[name="Hoshiguma"]  They were with me a lot longer than you. I knew them much better than you.
[name="Ch’en"]  It’s my duty to protect Lungmen. No matter who stands in my way, it’s my duty. That hasn’t changed.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  So you’re still Superintendent Ch'en? And who gave you this duty?
[name="Ch’en"]  I did.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  ...Is that just something you wanted to hear yourself say?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Look at you. You’re gonna save Lungmen all by yourself? One woman against all of Reunion? Your temper tantrum won’t get you that far.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  It’s funny. You’re the one who always carried out Mr. Wei’s orders, because you could relate with him. Now I’m the one who relates with him a bit better, and I’m the one carrying out his orders. How the tables have turned.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I’ve seen the gist of Mr. Wei’s plans. If someone has to die, Mr. Wei thinks it ought to be him. You’re carrying the Ch’en family’s blood. Once all this blows over, no one’s coming after you.
[name="Ch’en"]  You mean, he—
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Mr. Wei would rather he die than you.
[name="Ch’en"]  You give him too much credit.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Maybe you don’t give him enough, Ch'en.
[name="Ch’en"]  If he wants to die, he’s welcome to it. But what will that get us? What’s the point? Will it prevent a war? Will it get Lungmen out of this mess?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  If he dies, it’ll get some of the blame off Lungmen. I think all the blame will pretty much vanish into thin air, actually.
[name="Ch’en"]  You really think it’ll be that easy?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Nothing’s ever that easy. That’s why he wants you running the L.G.D.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  You’ll get his job and be Chief of the L.G.D. sooner or later. After that, you’ll become the boss of the entire city.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  There’s been a lot of rot left behind, and you should be the one to clean it out.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I get what Mr. Wei wants from you. Though he’s been waiting for a long time, I can tell that his beliefs and methods haven’t changed from the day I met him.

[name="Hoshiguma"]  Don’t mess with me, Ch'en. No one’s more Lungmen than you.

[name="Hoshiguma"]  ...What?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  ...
[name="Hoshiguma"]  ...Since when...?
[name="Ch’en"]  Three years ago.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  You’ve been hiding it from me?
[name="Ch’en"]  I didn’t mean to...
[name="Hoshiguma"]  How come you didn’t even tell me...?
[name="Ch’en"]  Wei Yenwu didn’t want anyone to know. We couldn’t have an Infected in the L.G.D. So I couldn’t be Infected.
[name="Ch’en"]  Hoshiguma, there is no place for the Infected here. Or anywhere else in the world.
[name="Ch’en"]  I’ve had enough of Wei Yenwu controlling us. I’m not going to be his tool anymore.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  No. I get it.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I finally... actually, really get it, Ch'en. I know exactly why you can’t leave Lungmen.
[name="Ch’en"]  ...What?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  If you leave and go to that core city, Mr. Wei would have to brand you an enemy. Not just an enemy, but a dangerous Infected enemy working against Lungmen...
[name="Hoshiguma"]  The whole city would know you’re Infected. They might even think you’re working with Reunion.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  And that’ll be the end of it. You’ll never be able to come back.
[name="Ch’en"]  I don’t care.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  That’s my line.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  “You’re Infected? I don’t care.”
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I don’t care. Missy doesn’t care. Nine doesn’t care. The L.G.D. doesn’t care.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Not even Mr. Wei cares. He wants you to change this place. He doesn’t want you gone.
[name="Ch’en"]  You didn’t see how ruthlessly he treated the Infected. I did.
[name="Ch’en"]  And Nine? She’s already gone. She quit the L.G.D. because she was Infected too.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  ...Nine too...?
[name="Ch’en"]  You know, Nine and I might’ve contracted Oripathy on the same mission.
[name="Ch’en"]  She went undercover for me in Reunion... And then, because of Reunion, she abandoned Lungmen.
[name="Ch’en"]  Because she saw the truth of this city.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  But you didn’t betray Lungmen. I’m not letting you take the fall for a crime you didn’t commit. 
[name="Ch’en"]  Hoshiguma, why do you think... I’m going to the core city?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I’ve never been good at guessing games. Just get to the point.
[name="Ch’en"]  Heh...
[name="Ch’en"]  Do you know who’s leading Reunion?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I forgot her name.
[name="Ch’en"]  Talulah.
[name="Ch’en"]  Missy didn’t tell you?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Tell me what?
[name="Ch’en"]  Talulah is my sister.
