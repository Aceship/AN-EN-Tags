It seemed as if I heard the residents' shrieks, and seemed too as if I'd heard nothing at all.
I only thought of bringing Saoirse away, but no matter how I tried to put the strength in my fingers, the ash would still slip and fall through the cracks.

[name="Janie"]You don't seem a thing like those Laterano clerics.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#6")]
[name="Outcast"]Years and experience are pretty good at changing a person.
[name="Outcast"]They had me arbitrating a war. Who the sides were, or why they were fighting, that's not important anymore. The parties responsible for getting the ball rolling are probably all dust anyway.
[name="Outcast"]I just remember, there was a city asking for my help. I told them to lay their weapons down, I was ready to be their go-between, and off I went for peace talks with a general from the side sieging the place.
[name="Outcast"]The people in the city really weren't up for it, with the whole 'surrendering to tyranny' thing, so I took some drastic measures to get them talking, but we still never came to an agreement, in the end.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#2")]
[name="Outcast"]I gave up hope and left, bringing with me just a few who were willing to quit fighting, but the second day after I left, the city was breached.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#5")]
[name="Outcast"]Pretty much everyone who stayed ended up dead.
[name="Outcast"]I believe... a good chunk of them all thought, nearing death's door, I'd still come and protect them in the end. But I didn't.
[character(name="avg_npc_245_1#7")]
[name="Outcast"]Looking back, I guess I was on the other side. I was the sinister pretender who'd given them hope, gotten them massacred.
[character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_245_1#7",focus=1)]

[character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#5$1",name2="avg_npc_245_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]Really? What if I kept at it, tried harder to stop the massacre that was coming?
[character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_245_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Janie"]Then you probably couldn't save a single one.
[character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_245_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]Or maybe I shouldn't have gone there with unrealistic hopes in the first place. Maybe I should've walked up and put a bullet in the head of the brute about to butcher an entire city.
[character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_245_1#5",focus=1)]

[character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_245_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]But still, are you telling me you'd stand by and watch—just let evil happen over and over, and over again?
[character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_245_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Janie"]...I wouldn't.
