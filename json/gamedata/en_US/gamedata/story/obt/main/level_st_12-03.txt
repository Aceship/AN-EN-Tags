The Catastrophe cloud in the sky has not yet dissipated.
Should you take off your gloves, you would be able to feel the Originium dust in the air scratching the palm of your hand.
The Nachzehrer King sits atop his throne, casting his eyes across his army.
The Nachzehrer's army will not be shaken. The Nachzehrer's army will not show weakness.
They pass through the storm, beyond injuries, and over the carcasses of compatriots and enemies alike.
The Sarkaz continue to march. Until the enemies of the Nachzehrer King are completely crushed, they have no right to stop.
'They are War itself.'
