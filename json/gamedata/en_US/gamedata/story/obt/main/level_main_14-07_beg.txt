Wellington is well-acquainted with his most loyal subject – the oldest gun aboard the ship, that which assisted him in blowing open the gates of Lingones.
He killed the mightiest nomadic city on Terra. He pulled the spine from its corpse and made it a part of his warship.
Afterwards, he took the Gastrell to many lands, and conquered many foes.
The Arts orbs of Leithanian casters, the shields of Ursine vanguards, the golden blades of Sargonian assassins – he collected and modified the most valuable components of his enemies, and placed them upon his flagship.
But not for the sake of commemoration. Only those who have become weak and frail through the passage of time need to rely on these vestiges to remember the past.
The Gastrell must step over the bones of its enemies, assimilating their power so that it may become stronger.
Only this way can the two of them defeat even stronger enemies together.

A salvo of artillery fire.
Only a few tiny twigs fall from the smoke and dust.
The force that was enough to shatter those crystalline waves cannot even shake the figure floating in the air.
The Nachzehrer King casts his gaze down upon the commander at the center of the army. Not far behind the old Feline, the bloodthirsty warship is waiting, eager to tear at his rotting flesh.

[name="Nezzsalem"]We have devoured many Victorians. General, Duke. Whatever the title, they all tasted the same.

[name="Nezzsalem"]Conspirators. Merchants. But none of their warriors.

[name="Nezzsalem"]They saw the battlefield as little more than a sandbox atop a table. The soldiers, mere chess pieces; war itself, only a tool for power and profit. How frivolous war was to them.

[name="Nezzsalem"]But, you are different. Your ship has also feasted on many enemies.

Wellington draws his sword and points it at the Sarkaz in midair.
Behind him, all the guns on his ship are pointed in the same direction.
