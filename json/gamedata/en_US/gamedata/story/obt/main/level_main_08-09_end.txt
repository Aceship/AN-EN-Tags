[name="Shieldguard"] *Pant* *pant*...
[name="Shieldguard"] Rhodes Island's medical technology is streets ahead of ours... I'll give you that...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"] Part of our plan is to send medical personnel to all the Infected settlements, but it’s way too dangerous to send our normal medical operators into warzones.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=2)]
[name="Shieldguard"] I’m good... Thanks. I’m much better now that I’ve been bandaged. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] The enemies have retreated. The battlefield has grown in size. I can’t use my Arts anymore. I can’t track them down.  
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"] You can count on the devils on the team to get that done for you. They’re very good at that.
[name="Shieldguard"] Thank you, Rhodes Island soldiers. Without your bravery, the number of casualties would have been much higher. 
[name="Shieldguard"] I also heard you saying just now, Cautus, you’re trying to make it to the control tower by yourself? 
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"] ...Uh, yeah, but also probably not.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=2)]
[name="Shieldguard"] What does that even mean?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"] I will probably be the only one there when I face Talulah.
[name="Amiya"] A warrior from Lungmen might also be there... but I am just going to assume there won’t be anyone else right now.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=2)]
[name="Shieldguard"] How do you plan on killing her all by yourself? You are nothing like the captain. 
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"] Sure, but neither is anyone else here. The more people we have there, the bigger of a mess things are going to be if a fight does break out. Besides, Talulah is much better than Patriot at quickly bringing the battlefield under control with her Arts. 
[name="Amiya"] I’ll bring a squad inside with me. There are bound to be other threats in the control tower.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=2)]
[name="Shieldguard"] Are you sure you’re bringing enough?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"] I trust the people on my team. Each and every one of them can be counted on, and they know how to adjust to all kinds of situations. If we end up somewhere we can’t handle ourselves, we will ask for your help.  
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=2)]
[name="Shieldguard"] Are you trying to keep us out of the final showdown?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"] No, It’s not that I’m trying to take charge of the battle. It’s just that, sir, there are other battles that only you, the guerrillas, can handle.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=2)]
[name="Shieldguard"] You want us to stop anyone from getting inside?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"] Exactly.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] ...Amiya, you don’t want me to go with you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"] It’s safer for you to stay outside the control tower.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] You don’t want me to fight with you? We’ll take on Talulah... together...! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"] Rosmontis, Talulah’s Arts are filled with energy. You’re really good at dealing with all kinds of physical attacks that come your way, but... I’m worried about her flames...
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] But... but she... she killed Ace... she killed so many people who mattered so much to me!
[name="Rosmontis"] Why can’t I go?
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"] ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] If I’m not good at dealing with that... What should I do? What can I do? There were lots of other things I wasn’t good at too!  
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"] You hate Talulah.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] What else am I supposed to do?! Is it bad if I hate her? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"] Rosmontis...
[name="Amiya"] I don’t have the answers to those questions. I’m not saying you can’t hate someone you’ve never met. I don’t have that right. 
[name="Amiya"] But, Rosmontis... before I go, I’ll leave you with an order.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] An order?
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"] That’s right.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] Orders have to be followed... Kal'tsit told me... elite operators follow orders. I... 
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"] Yeah.
[name="Amiya"] —Logos told me before we left. Patriot rarely sees anyone as his nemesis...
[name="Amiya"] He prefers calling people by symbols or any characteristics or equipment they have, and doesn’t usually call by name or race.
[name="Amiya"] But he called you a Feline just now.
[name="Amiya"] That might mean he approves of you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] But he calls you that too. He called you a Cautus. And what is it about me he liked? Is it how scary I look to others? I don’t want people to see me like that.   
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"] ...But, you know how often we’re called monsters? People have been calling Patriot a monster for many, many years.
[name="Amiya"] It’s true that the Arts we possess are really scary.
[name="Amiya"] But he thinks of us as people. He thinks of us... as humans. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] Not equals? We’re both... scary... and things that other people hate. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"] No, that’s not right. Just look at all the guerrilla fighters here. Then there’s the Reunion fighters following the other leaders, and, of course, our own people. 
[name="Amiya"] Your good deeds earn their respect. On the other hand, bad deeds earn their hate and mistrust. 
[name="Amiya"] We are judged by our actions. Just like how our teammates look out for you, just like how the Shieldguards defend Patriot, and just like how we trust Dr. Kal'tsit’s word without question. 
[name="Amiya"] Rosmontis, here’s my order for you: Live, and make sure as many survive this as possible.
[name="Amiya"] And, in order to do that, don’t come after me even if I don’t make it myself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] Amiya! But... you’re my friend! I couldn’t let you... let you go in there all by yourself! 
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] No means no! Rosmontis, I promise you this.  
[name="Amiya"] I promise I will come back alive.
[name="Amiya"] So that’s why, no matter what anybody says, no matter what they say happened to me, we both need to do whatever it takes to fulfill our mission.
[name="Amiya"] We have to survive this. Both of us.
[name="Amiya"] And this order goes for everyone who’s here right now.
[name="Amiya"] You must live.
[name="Amiya"] The whole point of the Chernobog rescue mission was to save lives.
[name="Amiya"] The whole point of the Core City infiltration was to save lives too.
[name="Amiya"] Don’t ever say things like, “There are causes worth giving your life for.” Never say that.
[name="Amiya"] Life is precious, and more importantly, your life belongs to yourself.
[name="Amiya"] No one... absolutely no one can let their life go to waste for us.
[name="Amiya"] ...There’s no such thing as necessary sacrifices.
[name="Amiya"] To say otherwise is just wrong.
[name="Amiya"] Guard!
[Character(name="avg_npc_059")]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"] ...Yeah, I’m listening, Amiya... Leader of Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] This goes for Reunion too.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=2)]
[name="Shieldguard"] ——
[name="Shieldguard"] Cautus!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"] Go ahead. 
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="avg_npc_058",focus=2)]
[name="Shieldguard"] Just leave this place to us. Feline, let’s go! Let’s give the little rabbit the battlefield she wants.  
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] Amiya...
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"] You have to do this.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Rosmontis"] ......
[name="Rosmontis"] Okay. I will see this through. 
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"] Yeah, thanks.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] Amiya Squad, follow me!
[name="Amiya"] Everyone, we’ll meet again! Alive!
[Character(name="avg_npc_059")]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"] Goodbye...
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"] We’ll see you later!

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] No, you’re clear as day. So perfectly clear that I thought I misheard. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Superintendent Ch’en, you should know this is outside your purview.

[name="Wei Yenwu"] What did the Royal Guard Academy teach you anyway? Did they ever tell you to keep your feet on the ground and not bite off more than you can chew? 
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Ch’en"] I graduated long ago. Now, I’m a police officer serving Lungmen. 
[name="Ch’en"] I’ll repeat again, so listen up. “My wish is to join the L.G.D., and from there, I’ll join the Special Inspection Unit.”
[name="Ch’en"] I will protect this city, and I’ll clean this place up. There won’t be another incident like that. 
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] What incident?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",focus=1)]

[name="Ch’en"] My apologies, Chief Wei.
[name="Ch’en"] Sir, I am referring to the incident that took place roughly ten years ago when the city was infiltrated by foreign forces. Several Lungmen citizens were kidnapped, and they are yet to be found.
[name="Ch’en"] I will continue to push the city to investigate and locate the kidnapped citizens after my admission to the department.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Ch'en... You have no idea what you are talking about.

[name="Ch’en"] Sir, I am perfectly aware of what I am talking about.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] I won’t argue. How about this, then? As soon as you don’t think you can keep it up, just let me know. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Tell me, Superintendent Ch'en. How long do you want to be in the department?

I didn’t give him an answer.
For all these years, I’ve always wondered... just how much longer can I do this? How much longer do I want to do this?
And it wasn’t until now that I finally realized the answer isn’t for me to decide.
The Chi Xiao has gotten pretty rusty in my hand lately. I wonder just when will I finally understand? Shadowless doesn’t mean to chase after shadows or let go. Instead, it’s to never look back.
