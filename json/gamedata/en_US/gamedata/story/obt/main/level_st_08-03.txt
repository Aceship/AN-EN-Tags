[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] Any passage through the... sealing... layer?
[Character]
[name="Rosmontis Squadmember"] Yeah, this part leads to an engineering passage. Should be able to directly enter the structural control area, hack their remote panels. They can't do a thing about that.
[name="Rosmontis Squadmember"] Otherwise, for the open passages, recon ops have sighted at least four battlegrounds, all of them guerrillas against other Reunion...
