The statues do not look the same. Some of them look solemn, others look kind.
She finds no image of them in her memory, but feels some kind of connection with them, deep down.
The only ones who may style themselves Victoria are the monarchs of Victoria, and the heir to the throne.
Therefore, she is Victoria, just like them.
She looks away.
Compared to vast and glorious Victoria, she is more familiar with the tiny taverns of Norport Borough, the scalding bitterness of cheap ale, and licking a sour lollipop after a fight.
She turns away.
In that moment, she spots a shadow behind the statues.

The war is not over. It is not yet time to reminisce.
But as she gazes upon the broken armor of the Steam Knights, all the memories of the last battle of the Knights of the Tower gush to the surface.
She does not understand. Why is the end always like this, when there are so many people who love this land?
Why must heroes fade away quietly in the dark? Why are they never triumphant?
She can't take it anymore.

[name="Siege"]But someone by the name of Gawain told me that there were no Steam Knights in Londinium at the time.

[name="Allerdale"]Revere? I don't know if I can say that.
[name="Allerdale"]I'm just thinking... Sir Charles Lynch was the last Steam Knight to be knighted during His Majesty's reign.
[name="Allerdale"]There were no new Steam Knights in the two decades following.

[name="Allerdale"]Was it a warning? Or the price of a struggle that no one knows about? Did the dukes have their blades pointed at each other's throats?
[name="Allerdale"]Perhaps the betrayal had already started by then.
