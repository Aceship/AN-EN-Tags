[name="Mephisto"]  It's your turn to move.
[name="Mephisto"]  If you can kill me here, all of my forces will collapse.
[name="Mephisto"]  It would be such a pity if you refused to even have a chat with me. Please, come kill me - if you can, that is.

[Character(name="char_015_lmg")]
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Madam Ch'en!
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  The enemy's attacks are too overwhelming! We can't afford to drag this out any longer!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mephisto"]  The situation is quite straightforward - only one of us will survive.
[name="Mephisto"]  I promise to keep my last words short, Madam, as long as you can make me say them.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Do you think yourself a martyr?
[name="Ch'en"]  Nobody will remember you after you die. Being dead and being respected are two completely different matters. What matters is what you've done in life, not how you die.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mephisto"]  I obviously wish for nothing more than to play with worthwhile foes, and then to die a worthwhile death.
[name="Mephisto"]  But I don't think you'll be able to help me fulfill my desires after all. You will suffer a terrible defeat, Madam. Now it's my turn to point out the situation that you're in.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Your confidence was built upon the fall of Chernobog.
[name="Ch'en"]  But this isn't Chernobog, nor is this the ruthless land of Ursus.
[name="Ch'en"]  The mighty Lungmen will not fall into the hands of scum like you.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1",focus=2)]
