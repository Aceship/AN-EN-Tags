[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  Signs of combat using sharp, blade-type Arts. Made quick work of three Reunion guys, tossed them over here.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  ...still going.
[name="Amiya"]  Dr. Kal'tsit!
[name="Amiya"]  Um, I’m asking you and the medic operators to take care of the Reunion people. They may have important information.
[name="Amiya"]  And we’ve picked up Madame Ch'en’s trail here...

[name="Amiya"]  But Madame Ch'en was able to take on a rogue Reunion team all by herself back there...
[name="Amiya"]  This time, it’s totally different.
[name="Amiya"]  We had a cooperation agreement then, nothing else. I was only starting to learn who Madame Ch'en was...
[name="Amiya"]  But here, we’re already...

[name="Ursus Infected"]  The Infected who managed to just barely keep themselves alive, thanks to Reunion; and the countless Infected who died here, thanks to Reunion...
[name="Ursus Infected"]  But we weren’t Infected before.
[name="Ursus Infected"]  They scattered the people of Chernobog in all directions, then hunted us down. It started as a slaughter, then turned to torture, and finally they dumped the survivors like trash!
[name="Ursus Infected"]  I don’t even know how many starved or froze to death...
[name="Ursus Infected"]  But those of us who survived were all Infected by constant exposure to Originium! Every last one of us!
