A tremendous energy bursts from the depths of the night.
Without a flicker of a flare, from the statue to the city hall, all living beings are instantly, silently snapped to ash.
And immediately after, an army seeps out from the night and the ashes, without a sound.

[name="Horn"]  But the crossbow in our hands reveals a lot of information.
[name="Horn"]  Firstly, the enemy has secretly been plotting for longer than we thought; secondly, beyond the goods they've stolen from our possession, there are other powers that have been funding their operations in the long term.
[name="Horn"]  In other words, in this instance, here, they had no plans to take up new equipment and rush to arms.

[name="Triangle"]  I can't risk talking too much. Worried they might hear. Next time we make contact, you'll know who the thief was.

[name="Horn"]  This is too dangerous!

[name="Triangle"]  Haha... Leader, you and Bagpipe, be careful too.

[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  I hope you aren't here to give me nonsense, Skamandros. As you can see, our enemy is savage. I have no time to contest with you again.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_npc_227_1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"]  Colonel, the enemy is hiding in the agricultural plates.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_npc_227_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  What?
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_npc_227_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"]  That's where they were concealed. On top of that, they're not all in the city—they have even more hands.

[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_npc_227_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"]  I suggest you send someone fast to evacuate the citizens at the ag plates, and carry out emergency decoupling of the central city and those plates ASAP, to avoid letting even more of the enemy into the city!
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_npc_227_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  I don't need you instructing me on what to do.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_npc_227_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"]  Colonel! It may not be in our power to prevail if we solely depend on the stationed troops, and my platoon, to cope with enemy forces infiltrating the city. We have to ensure the enemy gets no further reinforcement—
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_npc_227_1",focus=2)]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  You can go.

[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  It's my business how County Hillock is preserved.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#7",name2="avg_npc_227_1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"]  In the principal duty that is upholding the security of the Victorian Empire, we should be united!

[Character(name="avg_npc_227_1",name2="avg_npc_248",focus=2)]
[name="Adjutant Hill"]  Yes, Colonel. The Tarans are assisting them.

[Character(name="avg_npc_227_1",name2="avg_npc_248",focus=2)]
[name="Adjutant Hill"]  According to plan. The final batch of material will arrive at around noon.
[Character(name="avg_npc_227_1#5",name2="avg_npc_248",focus=1)]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  Good. Have them speed up the remodeling. Every time I even think of those disgusting things bounding around in my city, it has me eager to finish this.
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  Oh, yes, Skamandros and her subordinate. The wolf from Londinium is still biting fast and won't let go. You've heard, haven't you? They have a helping hand outside.
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  Give the command. Regardless of the means, we cannot let anyone stand in the way of our plans.
[Character(name="avg_npc_227_1#5",name2="avg_npc_248",focus=2)]
[name="Adjutant Hill"]  Yes, Colonel.
[Character(name="avg_npc_227_1",name2="avg_npc_248",focus=1)]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  As for Skamandros, before we're done, she cannot be left to act freely.
[Character(name="avg_npc_227_1",name2="avg_npc_248",focus=2)]
[name="Adjutant Hill"]  I understand.
[Character(name="avg_npc_227_1#1",name2="avg_npc_248",focus=1)]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  I have realized something... thanks to her talking-to.
[Character(name="avg_npc_227_1#2",name2="avg_npc_248",focus=1)]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  Why were our movements last night at Bolton's already known to the enemy?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_227_1#6",name2="avg_npc_248",focus=1)]
[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  Skamandros... no, it couldn't be. Though she shares that weakness and naivete innate to her kind of nobility, she has a highly secured loyalty to the Empire.

[name="Colonel Hamilton"]  Within these last few hours, one more thing must be done. And it's long overdue.
