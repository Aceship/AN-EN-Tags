[name="Delphine"]Vina and I inspected this forward base.
[name="Delphine"]The troops are disciplined, and morale is high. The dukes are taking this seriously.
[name="Delphine"]They seem to have reached a united front, allowing their troops to be organized according to function rather than faction.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Delphine"]At least, that's what it looks like on the surface.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Delphine"]We saw Caster's elites standing guard near all the Wellington tents.
[name="Delphine"]And at least two or three groups of Caster's men stationed further away.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="Siege"]A faked unity is unity nonetheless.
[name="Siege"]At least, in a time of crisis, the dukes know who their true enemy is.

[name="Shearer"]One more piece of bad news. I checked out the field hospital. It's sparkling clean. There isn't a single wounded inside.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_867_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]Please, no need to get excited. Facts are facts, no matter how you choose to interpret them.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]My orders were always to bring the Realmblade to the Stone of the Sword, with or without Exemplars.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]Please, consider it an act of good faith that I am telling you the truth now, rather than simply taking the sword from you during your darkest hour.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_867_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]Like I said, the history around the sword and the pedestal is a complex one. One that ought to be known only by a selected few royals and nobles.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]In the distant past, even before the Shah of Past and Future, an explorer discovered an artifact deep in the sands in the south of Sargon.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]It was by no means a sword, but it was able to repress the spread of Originium crystals within a certain area
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]The treasure allowed the explorer to survive a Catastrophe that should have engulfed the entire team.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#5$2",focus="m")]
[name="Siege"]The legend of the Catastrophe cleaver...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_867_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]The survivors forged a sword out of the artifact and presented it to the Shahanshah at the time, as a symbol of valor.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]In the Year 737, the Aslan Padishah Lugalszamszi brought the Sighs of Kings to Victoria.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#5$2",focus="m")]
[name="Siege"]Decades later, his grandson became Victoria's first Lord of Lions.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_867_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]The sword has severed the head of a red dragon, witnessed the reconciliation between Aslan and Draco, and became the symbol of Victoria's royal authority.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]It has been damaged and reforged several times, and many have tried to uncover the secret behind its ability to fend off Catastrophe.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]Scholars have yet to understand the principles behind the sword's power, but they did discover how to make the most of it.
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]The pedestal, dubbed Stone of the Sword, at the Mausoleum of Kings is the result of research by House Caster.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="Siege"]The Duke of Caster at the time kept a backup.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_867_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="'Trilby Asher'"]After the original pedestal in the Mausoleum of Kings was destroyed in that battle, the only working replica is kept on the Glorious.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Delphine"]For a century, Caster has coveted the Realmblade. The chance has finally arrived.
[name="Delphine"]Countless soldiers and civilians will die in the war. But Caster gets to reap the fruit of victory and become the hero who saves Victoria?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_867_1#1$1",focus="m")]
