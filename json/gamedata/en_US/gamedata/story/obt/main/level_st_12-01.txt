The veteran officer grins, showing a mouthful of yellowed teeth.
The young soldier laughs dryly. He knows this is one of the officer's many poor jokes.
The wind is so strong on the deck that the soldier has to hold on to the brim of his hat, letting out a loud yet harmless sneeze.
No matter the season or weather, standing on the deck of a prancing high-speed battleship always makes one want to wrap himself in his coat.
The young soldier thinks to himself– Wells is in charge today; how many cans of rations did that pudgy, bald man swipe?
But, the creamy vegetable chowder he makes is without equal, and if fortune is on his side, that old bastard might even throw in a healthy serving of fowlbeast into the soup.
He figures that he should leave after the sun sets and he finishes dinner.
The mobile fortress they're stationed in has already reached Londinium's vicinity. When the weather is clear, they can even see the pinnacle of The Shard on the horizon.
After returning to the station, he'd board the logistics squad's transport vehicle and head to the nearest town first, where he'd be able to have a drink or two at the tavern.
In the early morning, there'd be cobblers heading into town to sell their wares. Two boxes of tobacco would let them hitch a ride.
The young soldier recalls those barns from back home, always filled with the fermented smell of composted straw.
Even now, that smell occasionally wafts to him in his dreams, making him want to pinch his nose. But at the same time, it represents a connection with his hometown.
[Dialog]
[delay(time=1)]
If it only occurs occasionally, then so be it. He furrows his brows quietly, deciding not to continue deluding himself with these sentiments.
Even if it's only occasional, he doesn't want to experience that stench again. He must admit, that is always the biggest impediment every time he returns home.

[name="Veteran Officer"]Wasn't much better when we were stationed at Leithanien's outskirts, but at least you could enjoy a little sunshine in the afternoon.
[name="Veteran Officer"]Go. Tell the Captain, we can't see a thing at this weather observation outpost. Something's interfering with the radar too. We should head back.
[name="Veteran Officer"]Caster's forces are obediently maintaining formation, Gododdin moved his men further back. Other than the few familiar faces in the forward team, old Wellington's main force still hasn't shown up.
[name="Veteran Officer"]Other than our dear Duke Windermere, the remaining seven dukes are watching on from the sidelines. The patrol's over.
[name="Young Soldier"]Sir, that Sarkaz...
[name="Veteran Officer"]None of our business. The brass always have their own agenda.
[name="Young Soldier"]But, I heard that Londinium's...
[name="Veteran Officer"]Piers, I've been a soldier for over a decade. After drinking and playing cards, the most important thing I've picked up from being in the army is–
[name="Veteran Officer"]Those rumors you hear are always bunkum and balderdash. Never pay any heed to them. The officers in the back have their eyes on the map and will take care of everything; ours is but to do and die.
[name="Young Soldier"]Isn't it our duty... to defend Victoria?
[name="Veteran Officer"]Only they can decide what Victoria is, boy. Our job is simply to follow orders.
[name="Veteran Officer"]Go and head back. Our day of peace is over.

Maybe things have been too stressful these days. The young soldier begins to thank himself for taking some time off to unwind.
The battlefield always puts people on edge, even more so when you don't know where the when or where war will break out, or who you can trust.
He thinks to himself, it's a bit clammy.
He lifts his hand to undo the first button of his shirt. Seeing as how his dear officer had just declared the end of the armistice, a little disregard for protocol shouldn't matter.
He thinks of the fireplace back home. A few years ago, he came home wearing a brand-new military outfit, unwilling to undo even a single button despite sweating profusely from the heat of hearth. For that, the young lass Shirley laughed at him for quite some time.
The young soldier curls the corner of his lips.
[name="Young Soldier"]Heh. That's why I didn't bring you your sappy romance novel. Payback.
