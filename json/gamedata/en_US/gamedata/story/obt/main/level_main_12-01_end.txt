[name="Golding"]The protagonists are always charming, suave, always heading to the frontlines wearing a uniform befitting of them with a pipe in their mouths.
[name="Golding"]But the authors never tell us which battlefield they head to and how the trenches smell.
[name="Golding"]Those who are enamored of the protagonist, both women and men, taste fine desserts with anxious hearts—
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Golding"]Of course, we all know these are just literary techniques. The stories always end happily.
[name="Golding"]Authors with a little bit of ambition might try to build what the critics call a 'profound' atmosphere.
[name="Golding"]The stories are adorned with preventable deaths, and they are always the protagonist's comrade and dearest friend, dying in the trenches to shield the hero.
[name="Golding"]In the end, the wretched enemy finds themselves defeated by the hero's sword, thus restoring justice and morality.
[name="Golding"]And at his fallen friend's funeral, a solemn crowd gathers to remember his heroics, as petals symbolizing honor are scattered atop the casket.
[name="Golding"]This is the most emotional part. The protagonist clenches his fist, wipes his tears, and looks toward the morning sun with resolve—
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_647_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Golding"]And without fail, they always say that hope will come and all sacrifices will be meaningful.
[name="Golding"]And there. That's where the author stops. Let the readers imagine for themselves that truly beautiful future. Let them bask in that stately feeling in the end.

[name="Amiya"]Is Dr. Kal'tsit better?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_395_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Ascalon"]Hard to say. Her body... was frail to start with, and her wounds are deep.
[name="Ascalon"]Shining has attempted several solutions, but all of them were limited in their effectiveness. She has yet to awaken.
[name="Ascalon"]Mon3tr seems to be slowly repairing itself. Likewise, we do not have any idea how well it will recover, or whether it can actually even recover.

[name="Amiya"]I never once imagined that Dr. Kal'tsit would one day be wounded this badly...
[name="Amiya"]She always solved all our problems like they were nothing. She gave us the best advice for every situation.

[name="Amiya"]But... I want to see Dr. Kal'tsit one more time. May I?

[name="Ascalon"]Rather than staying with the wounded, you two have more important work to do.
[name="Ascalon"]Closure wants you to know that she has finished analyzing the data from the command tower.
