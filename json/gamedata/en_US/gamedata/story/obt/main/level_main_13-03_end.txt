[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_869_1#1$1",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_869_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Ermengarde"]—That <i>is</i> just the first part of the plan.
[name="Ermengarde"]Theresis and Theresa have no plans for evacuation at all. It seems they really do want Londinium to be the battlefield for a face-off against all the lands.
[name="Ermengarde"]We have no idea what's giving them so much confidence, but if it's their plan, brother and sister, then they must have some means in place already.
[name="Ermengarde"]So, if they do succeed—then that means we'll have to rebuild Kazdel, rebuild the Sarkaz's haven.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4088_hodrer_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Hoederer"]...And if they fail?
[name="Hoederer"]If the Sarkaz fail here, then we'll lose an entire generation of youth, and maybe every youth that was to come.
[name="Hoederer"]After the expedition of two hundred years ago, most nations had no clue about the present state of Kazdel. They weren't even interested.
[name="Hoederer"]Until all this, a lot of Victorian worthies believed Kazdel was just a pile of ruins.
[name="Hoederer"]But before the civil war, with Her Highness Theresa's establishment, Kazdel had a nascent nomadic city.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_412_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="W"]Until Theresis messed the whole thing up. Now Kazdel's just this supergiant witchcraft tractor, the kind that's got bolts and parts popping off it while it trundles along.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4088_hodrer_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Hoederer"]Kazdel wouldn't stand up to anything you could call a war, but the Regent just so happens to be starting one.
[name="Hoederer"]Once it begins, every spy will have made contact with Kazdel. How will those nations sitting on the fence... regard the Sarkaz within the territory?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_869_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Ermengarde"]Alright, you're a pessimist. Good, so am I.
[name="Ermengarde"]So, part two of the plan—the Liches hanging back in Kazdel have formulated the plans to break the place up.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_869_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Ermengarde"]If Theresis fails, Kazdel will immediately be split into pieces, maybe a dozen or more...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_869_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Ermengarde"]Taking their affiliated residents, as per the apportioned, er, 'clan' units, off to hide deep in the barrens.
[name="Ermengarde"]Route-planning, balanced production, and ensuring Kazdel becomes a nomadic city isn't without meaning. To the Sarkaz, the enmity of the rest of mankind is a Catastrophe.
[name="Ermengarde"]Kazdel will greet another age of exile.
