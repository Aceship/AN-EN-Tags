I have returned.
It feels like it has been a very long time since I left, and I have not come back to the ship for a good night's rest in quite a while either.
Doctor, Dr. Kal'tsit, Siege...
Has the war outside ended? Finally, I can have a rest.
I'd like nothing more than a bowl of hot vegetable soup at the cafeteria, then plop myself down in my bed in the dorms.
What about Theresa? At this hour, she should be—
...
No... No, that's not right...
Theresa is gone.

The room is empty. Nobody is waiting for my return.
I clearly remember that on many nights in the past, there would be someone who would tell me a whole library's worth of stories to put me to sleep.
But now, they are no longer here.
Wait... Why is there a piece of clothing on the bed?
A white dress, with a neat corsage sewn to the collar. The needlework is deft, clearly done by a very experienced hand.
'White suits you, Amiya.'
