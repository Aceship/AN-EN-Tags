[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#2$1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]

[name="Koshelna"]Because you want a definite answer from me? Because you want me to tell you that, yes, Kashchey has left your body, and you're just Talulah and no one else?
[name="Koshelna"]In that case, you will get what you want. I can tell you exactly what you want to hear right now.
[name="Koshelna"]The question then is... are you willing to believe me?
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]You want me to believe a Black Snake?
[name="Talulah"]Is this a new trick you're playing, Kashchey?
[name="Talulah"]You gave me more than enough information to find you in the shortest amount of time. I can only assume that you were luring me here.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]Have you gone back to our home, then? Our home, both yours and mine?
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]

[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]That's an awfully hurtful way to describe it.
[name="Koshelna"]But you read my letter nonetheless, didn't you? You remembered the channels through which Duke Kashchey received the Scales' correspondence. Not even the Secret Police who took over the dukedom could figure it out.
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]A letter sent ten years ago, and its sender is tenured here at this college.
[name="Talulah"]I don't know if I should be gasping in admiration of how well prepared you are, or if I should be grateful that this channel stayed hidden for ten years while your Scales have long been reduced to nothing?
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]Does it make you happy that the territory has fallen into such neglect? Talulah, under your rule, they could have lived a much better life. They shouldn't have been torn to shreds by the Fourth Army.
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]Stop pretending you care about them more than I do.
[name="Talulah"]Tell me. What is there in this small northern town for you to willingly stay here?
[name="Talulah"]Kashchey, if I remember correctly, you preferred cities further south.
[name="Talulah"]Not only because the air there is more humid, but also because lands where you cultivated generations of authority are more suitable for your scheming.
[name="Talulah"]But not the tundra. The folk here lead a hard life. They have plenty to worry about sorting out issues with their food and harvest.
[name="Talulah"]To them, the speeches you pride yourself on are like the artificial flower you wear. No purpose beyond aesthetics.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#6$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]Talulah... Talulah.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]What if I told you I'm here because your footsteps can be found in the tundra?

[name="Talulah"]I'd say you're feeding me nonsense.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]'The history of humanity is a history of struggle.'
[name="Koshelna"]You remember, don't you?
[name="Koshelna"]You applied everything that I taught you through the years to your struggle.

[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]Yet you destroyed everything that I built in the tundra.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#4$1")]

[name="Koshelna"]Who do you truly blame for this series of fatal mistakes in your heart?
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#2$1")]

[name="Talulah"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]Talulah, I know why you came to me.
[name="Koshelna"]You want to use your judgment on me to judge yourself. You want to hear me repent, so that you can start repenting yourself.
[name="Koshelna"]What you want is a tiny, pitiable bit of mental comfort.
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]Go on.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#6$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]You want me to go on? I thought—
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]You thought I would let you witness my fury? No, Kashchey. You don't deserve it.
[name="Talulah"]I've rehearsed everything you've said up to this very moment in my head, down to the very last word. A year and a half isn't that short, and I had nothing to do while I was imprisoned at Rhodes Island.
[name="Talulah"]If you want to survive this meeting, you'll need to say something more original.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]Very well. I can tell you've gotten more patient, thanks to that period of self-imprisonment.
[name="Koshelna"]But I brought up the tundra not because I wanted to provoke you.
[name="Koshelna"]Take a look at this school. Look at the students' faces.
[name="Koshelna"]They believe that the sunlight of may will melt the tundra's snow. They also believe that Ursus, colder and harder than even the tundra, will change beneath their feet.
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]So you're sullying their innocence with your despicable ideas?
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]You think I'm trying to find the next successor among them?
[name="Koshelna"]No, my dear. I'm just a normal university lecturer. The only things that I impart here are knowledge and ideas. I hold no authority or wealth.
[name="Koshelna"]If they want authority, they can fight for it themselves. If they seek a conspiracy, they are free to find the most suitable techniques in my lessons.
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]You want me to believe that the failure you experienced through me devastated you so much that you washed your hands of it all?
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#9$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]Failure? I never thought of that as failure.
[name="Koshelna"]Reunion was not destroyed in the Chernobog core city, and neither was Kashchey's plan.
[name="Koshelna"]Right, you managed to stop Kashchey. The war he sought, the war that could've changed Ursus history in an instant never came to be.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]But Ursus still went on the trajectory that Kashchey had set for her.
[name="Koshelna"]War is happening. The conflict between the Council and the Army intensified, and the will of the people is sparking new flames through each and every conflict.
[name="Koshelna"]And I will stand atop the most fertile soil, sowing seeds to the best of my abilities.
[name="Koshelna"]I will guide... or perhaps I should say spur these revolutions to take root.
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]I remember you once refuted the education of the masses as meaningless.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]If a ruler is so inflexible that she does not adapt to the changing tides, then she is undoubtedly following a path of destruction.
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]You still see yourself as a ruler. I see. You actually haven't changed at all.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#5$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]I almost forgot you hated that word as much as you hated Kashchey's control. I told you long ago that I didn't care who was in charge.
[name="Koshelna"]How many times has power changed hands since the Ursus took these lands from the Hippogryphs?
[name="Koshelna"]Talulah, you are me, and I am you.
[name="Koshelna"]What we want... is an Ursus that can yet spark fires from our hands.
[character(name="avg_npc_415_1#8$1")]
[name="Koshelna"]These fires... will sooner or later engulf all of Ursus. No, not just Ursus. Victoria... and all the other countries will be caught in the flames too.
[name="Koshelna"]When the fire is over, will these lands become more prosperous? Or will they be dealt destruction?
[name="Koshelna"]Ursus has walked its first millennium. I will guide it down its second and third. This is the meaning behind the Black Snake's existence.
[name="Koshelna"]The Black Snake is immortal not because I want to live, but because Ursus must live.

[name="Talulah"]It wouldn't take any more work to kill you than it took to kill that old Phidia.

[name="Koshelna"]What are you waiting for, then? Quick, turn my body to ash, and scatter it all across this dark hallway!

[name="Talulah"]'Terrifying Infected Murderer Reemerges in College Campus' —That's the headline that will don the front pages tomorrow.
[Character(name="avg_npc_415_1#7$1", name2="char_011_talula_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Koshelna"]You wouldn't mind having that on your reputation.
[Character(name="avg_npc_415_1#7$1", name2="char_011_talula_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"]I should point out that I'm not afraid of the patrol unit who will be here in three minutes, either.
[Character(name="avg_npc_415_1#7$1", name2="char_011_talula_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Koshelna"]But... your new old friends who are waiting outside the city... They don't stand a chance against the Royal Guards.
[name="Koshelna"]Even if they begrudgingly allowed you to return to Ursus because of those in control... They wouldn't tolerate murdering anyone on Ursus land.
[Character(name="avg_npc_415_1#7$1", name2="char_011_talula_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"]Kashchey.
[name="Talulah"]If the Royal Guards found out that the immortal monster—the mastermind behind the Chernobog incident was right here, do you think they would try to take me in or turn their attention and blades to you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_415_1#7$1", name2="char_011_talula_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Koshelna"]......
[name="Koshelna"]So, why haven't you killed me yet?

[name="Talulah"]More or less.

[name="Nine"]Good. You seem to have lightened up. Even found yourself a sense of humor.

[name="Talulah"]No, but I also am not the old Talulah who would think that killing her would solve all our problems.
[name="Talulah"]I won't let her out of my sight, and when the time comes, I will kill her myself.
[name="Talulah"]But I have a weird feeling about this...

[name="Talulah"]—Ursus will kill her.
[name="Talulah"]Even now, she thinks she can bend human will. We will prove to her, though—
[name="Talulah"]One day, the people will awaken and abandon the ignorant conqueror.
[name="Talulah"]And on that day, there will be no more Black Snakes in Ursus.
[Character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2",name2="char_011_talula_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Nine"]What about now, then?
[character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2",name2="char_011_talula_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"]Now, before we come back here for the last time, we need to visit Victoria.
[Character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2",name2="char_011_talula_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Nine"]So you've decided to come with us?
[character(name="char_011_talula_1#3")]
[name="Talulah"]I'm your prisoner. I have nowhere to go except with you.
[name="Talulah"]Besides, you said it yourself... The Infected there are waiting for us.
