[name=""]   11:11 A.M   Weather/Drizzle
[name=""]   Outside of Muk Wo Warehouse, Sam Cheong Chai, Central Lungmen
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  The scouting is more or less complete. Our observation spot is stealthy enough, and there’s nobody around the warehouse.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Looks like it’s an abandoned construction site with piles of construction materials left behind. There are traces of things being dragged around.
[name="Ch'en"]  Reunion must have set up an ambush here.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Ch'en, is Phal your informant?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  ...Yes. Did you overhear our conversation?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I tried my best not to.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I'e known him for a long time, more than 10 years. There's no way I wouldn't recognize his voice.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  When did you make him a informant?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  He was infected more than a year ago. At that time, he disappeared from his bar, leaving the glasses he cleaned every day unattended and covered in dust.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Maybe even before that.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  You at least should have told me about it.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Looks like it’s about to rain. Let's get started and chase the enemies out of their ambush spots.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Sigh...
[name="Hoshiguma"]  We’re too late. He's going to bleed out.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I’ll draw Reunion’s fire. The rest of you should seize the opportunity to surround them and end this battle quickly.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Too dangerous.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  But it's the fastest way to win. You can trust me on this one.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I always trust you.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Follow Hoshiguma's instructions. Make it quick.
[Character(name="char_015_lmg")]
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Yessir!

[name="Ch'en"]  I'm ready, Hoshiguma.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  That’s more like it. I’m going to flush them out of their ambush spots. Give me three minutes.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Doing all that by yourself in three minutes? That’s way too reckless!
[name="Ch'en"]  If you show any signs of needing help, we’re going to attack.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  No, just give me my three minutes.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  …It’s all I’m going to need.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Here we go.
