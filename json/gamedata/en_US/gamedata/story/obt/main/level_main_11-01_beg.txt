[name="Sullen Voice"] Your Majesty... I've just received word. Those two pitiful Members have died in their cells.
[name="Impassioned Voice"]An end they deserve. It's time Parliament understood they serve Victoria, and not the businessmen stuffing their pockets with coin.
[name="Sullen Voice"] I understand your eagerness. Still, some are worried. Your pressure on the Court has terrified a great deal of Members who had been observing the situation. They may act with impropriety in days to come.
[name="Impassioned Voice"] They should be fearful! They'll better know their places.
[name="Impassioned Voice"] This unbroken succession of wars whiles away the riches our forebears accumulated over the ages, yet certain greedy condorwings have been reared—fattened by them.
[name="Sullen Voice"] I'm not looking for you to back down, but if we could just go a little slower...
[name="Impassioned Voice"] A little slower! As if the condorwings know when to stop. Why don't you look for <i>them</i> to <i>feed</i> a little slower?
[name="Impassioned Voice"] If we don't put our new tax policies in place, then once the enemy sees fit to pounce on Victoria and tear her flesh apart, even the mercenaries will leave us without a second thought!
[name="Sullen Voice"] If they consider themselves soldiers clear of mind and honorable of heart, they will stand by your side.
[name="Impassioned Voice"] I'm afraid the Red Dragon thought as much too, before he was forced to share half his crown.
[name="Impassioned Voice"] We all saw the end that befell him.
[name="Sullen Voice"] I promise you, no matter the hour, you will have Cumberland's loyalty.
[name="Impassioned Voice"] Of course, 'Cumberland the Ever on High'—how could I doubt where you stand?
[name="Impassioned Voice"] But you see, Robert, Victoria is in her hour of need, this very moment. The right of kings is waning upon this swathe of soil.
[name="Sullen Voice"] Why does Your Majesty think so?
[name="Sullen Voice"] It's your birthday the day after. Everyone is hoping to catch a glimpse of your visage. The servicemen are impatient to pay their respects to you, and the populace's cheers are sure to drown out the parade in turn.
[name="Impassioned Voice"] This year, perhaps. But what of next year? And when it comes time for my Alexandrina to succeed the throne?
[name="Impassioned Voice"] Robert, we <i>will</i> make our exit, sooner or later.
[name="Sullen Voice"] Your Majesty! You—

[name="Indistinct Officer"] Time's short, and chances are few. We need to confirm a few things.

No, someone has.
Not everyone loves to hang around in opulent halls with nothing to do, Allerdale thinks to herself.

[name="Obscured Merchant"]I don't understand. Why not choose today? The lion's finally left his den for once, and hardly any of the Guard are here.

[name="Indistinct Officer"]The same as those paragon few. They'll do nothing for their own gain, and everything for Victoria. Even if it won't be handy to support our actions, they'll understand the decisions from on high.

Allerdale's face presses against cold plate, but sweat nevertheless drips down her forehead.
It grows harder and harder not to move a muscle, not to mention keeping her breathing stifled. The voices of the two figures grow gradually out of reach, then suddenly are right before her.
For a blink, she quivers, trying as hard as she can not to let her body slip into view, curling even her toes in.

[name="Indistinct Officer"]First-generation steam knight armor.

[name="Obscured Merchant"]First-generation! That's over two hundred years ago. It's antique by now, isn't it? I'm sure it'd fetch a pretty price.

[name="Indistinct Officer"]Haven't you seen the family crest? It's House Cumberland's steam armor.

[name="Indistinct Officer"]Its old owner once stood before the Gaulish artillery in this, braced for three whole hours, just so His Majesty could flee unscathed together with his shattered people.

[name="Indistinct Officer"]Only during battlefield cleanup did people realize half this suit had been blown away, and the one inside may well have died soon after bombardment began—

[name="Obscured Merchant"]And here you're the one of Gaulish blood—I'm surprised you like reminiscing on these nobles' heroic deeds more than I do.

[name="Indistinct Officer"]Their belongings and your measuring of things don't mix. Even if this duke's home is razed to ash one day, the Cumberlands would never sell off this armor.

[name="Obscured Merchant"]He's welcome to watch from his ivory tower all he likes, along with the rest of the dukes. No matter who the city's ruler nominally is, it won't make the dukes' authority any worse for wear, at least for the moment.

[name="Indistinct Officer"]Why can't he just let go of his loyalty to the lions? With colossal change about to greet Victoria, you wish he'd recognize where his loyalty <i>should</i> lie, sooner rather than later.

A faint noise comes from in front of them, a sound like someone gently drawing breath.
