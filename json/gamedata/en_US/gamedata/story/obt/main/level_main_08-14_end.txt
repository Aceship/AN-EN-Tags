[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ......
[name="Kal'tsit"]  There were two things that happened here that had to do with me.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The first of those happened some twenty years ago.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  About twenty years ago, a small mining company controlled by the Boris Group of Ursus unearthed a strange set of equipment in the southern mountains.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  News about this quickly traveled to the conglomerate's leader—Count Boris.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  At the time, the Count made a bold decision. He tried to build an industrial city with all the necessary facilities and equipment with the expectation that his conglomerate could shake its reliance on the military-controlled mining industry and the arms trade.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Now, the equipment could have been some inheritance passed down by the gods or a device of Sarkaz witchcraft. That doesn't matter. As long as it worked, it would give the Boris Group the breakthrough they needed.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Of course, it could also have been nothing but worthless scrap, and any amount of research would not have produced any meaningful results. It could also have been something perilous. Something that could level multiple settlements in the blink of an eye.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  They put together a team of talented scientists. All of them were young, sick of working with elementary theories, embittered by society, in need of money, and had been marginalized by academia for years.
[Decision(options="You were on the team.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That's right.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Soon after I left Columbia, I found out about this through my own networks. I joined the group—in order to keep them from blowing the entire city up. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I am something like an expert on the topic, so, one way or the other, I ended up becoming the scientists' mentors.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Now, Chernobog wasn't just your average emerging city. It used to be old and run down.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Before the scientists realized what the device's true purpose was, I allowed them to siphon a certain amount of its energy to provide Chernobog a resource other than Originium. Not much, but certainly not negligible. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Count Boris was beyond elated. He paid all that money, and he certainly got his money back.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  He was someone who really knew how to do business.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Chernobog quickly developed, and droves after droves of people were drawn to the city, seeking opportunity.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Many smaller cities joined the Boris Group as well, either out of respect for Boris himself or because they were awed by how generous the man was with his money.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  With Chernobog propelled to the fore, the scientists' research also reached an important breakthrough.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I... probably should've stopped them.
[Decision(options="Go on. It's okay.;......;You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Let me continue.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Brilliant as they were, a few of my students uncovered the device's secrets on their own. First, they realized that the energy they were siphoning was generated only as a side effect of the device's operations. A kind of hibernation mode...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Its original purpose was for the device to keep functioning normally.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  There was also one other thing that they realized. The energy that they had been siphoning for Chernobog was but a small fraction of the energy the device could actually provide. Just a tiny, tiny fraction. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  At first, they were ecstatic.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  This had to potential to greatly reduce Chernobog's reliance on the Originium mining industry.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If they could put together something similar to the device, then Ursus would never have to worry about energy again, and the mining and refining process of Originium would also become much simpler.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Then, fear began to sink in. If all that energy was used to forge weapons or begin a conquest, Ursus would undoubtedly be engulfed in a sea of flames yet again. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Now, fortunately, the scientists were all good, upstanding people. They wanted to prevent disaster. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And unfortunately... that didn't change a thing.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  When the Fourth Army got involved, the scientists had already realized just how serious the whole situation was.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And by the time my students were ready to have the device sealed, the secret police had already figured out all of their weaknesses.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Ilia was a leader amongst the scientists. He was both righteous and stubborn, qualities that went hand in hand.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The secret police knew that kidnapping his family would only unleash the hatred in him, so they picked someone else.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Sergei, my oldest student.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  He was Skullshatterer and Misha's father, a very indecisive chap.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The secret police hardly even threatened him, and that was enough to destroy what little determination he had.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The fear of losing his family and his respect for his colleague and their work tormented him, and in the end he chose what must have felt like a compromise to him.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  He turned over the experiments' objectives and data to Count Boris.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The reality is he shouldn't have trusted anyone. A drowning man will clutch at a straw, yet that straw could also be the very thing that ends up killing him. 
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Count didn't protect the scientists. He protected just Sergei and allowed the military to carry out an attack, which then turned into a massacre. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Count didn't have the power to protect the scientists. He could barely even hold his head up in the presence of the military's top brass.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Even though the military and the nobility had lost much of their influence after the Great Rebellion, that didn't change the fact Count Boris's family was new money. They bought their noble status from another family.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Sergei managed to save his children, and the price he had to pay was to watch the murder of all of his colleagues in the Core City's sarcophagus.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  After all the bodies were removed and the blood cleaned up, a new lab was set up for Sergei, built on top of his crumbling mentality.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Needless to say, Sergei never again produced anything meaningful with his research, and with the loss of all of their distinguished, albeit overly honest, scientists, Ursus's research on the device ended up in quite the mire.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  After that, everyone simply forgot about the place. No one cared. Nothing could be changed.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  After the secret police and the garrison packed their bags, the Count and Sergei had the placed sealed... The whole process was uneventful, too.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The equipment was kept running, and the energy just kept flowing from the sarcophagus to Chernobog's core city. Perhaps powering the entire city, even.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  For Sergei's service and sacrifice, the Count nominated him to the position of the City Council secretary.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Oh, and this happened after Sergei's son, Alex, was found to be Infected and exiled. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Count finally had the power to stand up against the military, and factories big and small began to spring up around his core city.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Fourth Army no longer had him under their thumb. All they could do was watch Chernobog leave its circle of influence.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  In the years since Chernobog began its operations, Count Boris also managed to make an enemy of Grand Duke Baikal, one of the advisors of the Third Army and the biggest beneficiary of the Farscope Refinery, thanks to their disputes over the prices of the raw materials used in manufacturing.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Grand Duke ordered several clandestine attacks on the city, but none of the attempts were able to shake the city. It had already become one of Ursus's most important cities.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Count then arranged matters so that the military was not allowed to garrison in Chernobog, so the armies could only do as the emperor told them, and stationed in the city's surroundings to defend it. To keep a watchful eye on the place, so to speak.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  What's more, Chernobog is not bound by the military and the old nobility's rules. One after another, copycat cities began to emerge all around Ursus. The desire for minerals and products drove the masses to seek out better ways. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Instead of being mere slaves that reek of filth and blood, they wanted to become slaves of a higher purpose.
[Decision(options="And that's where the problem lies.;......;Is this why Chernobog fell?", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Not completely.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I personally think that the moment the scientists... my students died at the hands of Ursus's greed, Chernobog was doomed to fall.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But be that as it may, I never used that as an excuse to forgive myself.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Now, thanks to everyone's kindness and fortitude, here's something I considered: Suppose it was used for the benefit of others, and suppose it was able to provide us a different path...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Ursus's scientists would've used it for the greater good—Though I can see how that would've turned out.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The person I used to be would never have arrived at that conclusion. It would just lead to the deaths of even more people. No matter how magnificent everything may seem in the beginning, in this evil world, our benevolence will always be twisted into something else. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  In other words, Dr. {@nickname}. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I was the one who sent them to the slaughterhouse.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I did nothing except stand there and watch them die.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And it all happened because the place I presumed the path would take us was a place I dreamt up out of immaturity. It's a dream that will never come true in the world we live in.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  All because they were all too kind.
[Decision(options="What did you want to do?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...Are you sure you want to know?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It's not something one would normally consider a part of a doctor's responsibilities. I am sure you are well aware, Dr. {@nickname}. I am more than just a doctor. 
[Decision(options="Yeah.;I guess not, then.", values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I can see you don't truly want to know. You are merely curious. Once you know the answer, you will only come to regret it.  
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I don't want you to regret this, Dr. {@nickname}. At least not yet. All I will say is that you were much better at handling these things than I. 
[Predicate(references="2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Perhaps you've already found your own answer, and thanks to your pity, or maybe benevolence, you are stopping me before I embarrass myself with a mistake.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You've saved my image and elevated yours. An awkward win-win situation, it seems. Thank you, Doctor. 
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[Decision(options="So you don't want to tell me?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I have lots of questions that I don't want to answer.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It's true. I'll admit it wasn't ever my intention to fulfill Ilia's final wishes like this.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  So much blood was spilled, so many lives were lost, and it turns out the very last thing I do to remedy all this is what I should've done in the very beginning.
[Decision(options="But if you were capable of doing that, why didn't you help them do this in the first place?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Because I didn't know them. Because I anticipated a different ending. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Dr. {@nickname}, there are people who inflict violence and send others to the gallows merely because they don't know the other person.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  A person can kill another without remorse solely because they don't know a thing about them.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If we knew everything about those other people, would we improve in any way?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Or would we disregard their actions and judge them as stringently as we can merely because they have more of an identity now? Would we determine guilt and innocence solely based on their identity?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Because they are rich or poor? Normal or Infected? From Ursus or from Lungmen? Or from the city or the countryside?   
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Have you ever wondered why all the Infected that Rhodes Island takes in are from the cities, are from well-off families, and had a decent education?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You have to admit. There are Infected out there who live in the wilderness, away from civilization; others live in far off places with no way to communicate with the cities; then there are those who live on the streets and in the back alleys, just trying to survive from one day to the next.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  None of them have ever even heard of Rhodes Island.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  To say nothing of those other Infected-oriented pharmaceutical and medical companies.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  This is the reality we are in.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  They didn't want to resort to violence. They just never had the chance to learn what else they could do. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  In the past, many people worshipped the power of violence because of the violence others had inflicted on them. Violence worked on them, so they used it on those around them, and that worked on those other people as well.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Therefore, violence became their tool. They don't understand life without violence, and their lives will always be ruled by pain and hatred. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Violence isn't a plough. The road traveled by violence will always remain a barren land. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Infected who was held in the sarcophagus and got warped into that monstrosity—
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Do you think he's evil?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Were we all born evil?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Was it power and violence that created the evil in humans, or was it the evil humans who created these tools to do harm to their fellow men?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We don't have the right to judge others. No one has that right. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  To recognize goodness and then do something good, to recognize evil and then to refute evil, and to combat evil with evil and then to win. All that makes us no different from our enemies, and we'd have to take our own lives by that logic.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But, Dr. {@nickname}, if you know me, then you'd know that there are always certain things that need to be done by someone.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But these are definitely not reasonable and fair behaviors, and certainly not something you can just carry out and claim to have the moral high ground.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  No matter the motive, we have to remember that what we are doing is doing harm.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  That's why I am not looking forward to getting your approval on anything I do.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Convincing you of anything is Amiya's job, not mine, and that's because I've done a lot of things that should be left unknown, should never again be attempted by anyone, and should never be forgiven.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Yet in the foreseeable future, there are a lot of decisions lying ahead of you. Yes, you. Not me. A lot of people still have high hopes for you. Me, not so much. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  My excuses will always just be my excuses. Your actions will always be your actions.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  It isn't realistic to expect that immorality and evil can be defeated easily.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If what you want is to instead destroy civilization in an instant and to live a life tormented by pain, that's definitely doable, and you should think about it.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Actually, this is the reason why I escorted you here.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  There are a few things that Amiya doesn't want me to tell you, but this may be our last chance. Before we have the sarcophagus buried, I need to pluck those fragments of truth out of your brain.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Dr. {@nickname}. Three years ago, with a heavily injured you in tow, I came back to this long-forgotten place, and placed you inside this device.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  This device can heal your pain, and only your pain.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  That was as detailed as I could possibly explain it.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The white Infected Creature we encountered earlier looked bizarre, didn't it? That wasn't how he used to look.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  From this, I can conclude that before he became an Infected Creature, the Infected entered the sarcophagus, and that was how the sarcophagus was activated.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...Perhaps he saw the footage of Amiya taking you out of the sarcophagus.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That prompted him to mess with the sarcophagus, and, one way or another, he got inside.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It shouldn't have happened.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The sarcophagus was originally designed to heal its operator, but this Infected got inside, and that's how disaster struck. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You saw the end result yourself. The Infected Creature wasn't a product of nature. The sarcophagus wasn't designed to handle it. Its transformation was entirely a man-made process. The sarcophagus transformed it.

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2")]
[name="Nine"]  Sure, we may be ready, but is Lungmen ready? Are the masses ready? Will the Chamber of Commerce vote for it? What do you think will happen if I tell the L.G.D. that I'm Infected?

[name="Nine"]  Wei Yenwu single-handedly built the L.G.D., and we've kept it running and maintained its integrity for so long... The department represents law and order, and I won't allow its name to be tainted!
[name="Nine"]  Besides, Ch'en, do you really think that those who live a better life can better keep their Oripathy in check, and those who live in the slums and mines face certain death?
[name="Nine"]  No, once you become Infected, there's only one way the world is going to deal with you.
[name="Nine"]  All Infected die, and as long as they all die the same way and we burn their bodies the same, there isn't anything that sets one apart from another.
[name="Nine"]  I won't ask for anyone's forgiveness; my Infected head count is well over a hundred. It's not karma that turned me into an Infected myself. It's just how the world works.

[Character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2")]

[name="Nine"]  I love this city. When I had nowhere else to go, it took me in, but, deep down in my heart, I know there isn't anywhere in the world that truly accepts the Infected. 
[name="Nine"]  I may love it here, but that doesn't mean I'm confident about it at all. I just know it a bit too well. I know what's worthwhile and what's a waste of time here.
[name="Nine"]  I don't just chill in my office and act all high and mighty. I pound the beat with you guys. I do that not because I try to look friendly to the citizens or want to show off.
[name="Nine"]  The only reason I am here is because Lungmen needs me.
[name="Nine"]  Wei is willing to take the Infected in for one reason and one reason only. He thinks the problems that the Infected bring with them are nothing compared to the problems that Lungmen has faced or will face.
[name="Nine"]  But whose heads do you think will roll first once those problems are all taken care of?
[name="Nine"]  Even if Wei doesn't, what about the city? What about the merchants and the masses, the workmen and the cops? 
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Lungmen can take in the Infected! Lungmen isn't just theirs... It's ours as well! So what does it matter if they're Infected? Does that somehow mean they can't do their part for the city? Does that mean the city can't protect them?   
[Character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2")]
[name="Nine"]  It can't.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  No, we're all the same. If we're all Infected, we'll be seen as equals. Remember. You said it yourself.  
[Character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2")]

[name="Ch'en"]  You...!
[Character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2")]
[name="Nine"]  I don't deny your efforts and sacrifice, Ch'en. You are one of the finest members I've ever seen in the department. But I have to warn you. You are not like them. 
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  ...No, I'm not working in Lungmen for the prestige. I am part of the L.G.D. I am part of Lungmen. 
[name="Ch'en"]  We poured our blood, sweat, and tears into this city, and its people are harsh, but it will come to accept everyone in the end.
[name="Ch'en"]  It will. It's been improving.
[name="Ch'en"]  Nine, even if we're Infected, we are still part of Lungmen!
[name="Ch'en"]  Lungmen is a city for all people. That's how it should be. If it isn't right now, then we will make it so. 
[name="Ch'en"]  Have we not seen enough? There are lots of good, honest Infected here, don't you agree? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2")]
[name="Nine"]  Then prove it to me.
[name="Nine"]  You want to prove to me that we belong here. Then do it.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  I will. I definitely will... 
[Character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2")]
[name="Nine"]  ...Be quick about it. I may not have that much time left in me. 
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  —I will.
[Character(name="avg_npc_043_1#2")]
[name="Nine"]  If you run into situations like this, just let Wei know. He'll take care of it. Keep in touch. Feel free to call if something comes up.  
[name="Nine"]  Oh yeah, tell Hoshiguma I said to keep an eye on you... lest you do something stupid.
[name="Nine"]  Feel free to forget what I just said, and I am sure you will, but make sure to tell her that before you do.

Teach by example. What has that turned me into?

[name="Amiya"]  But... it's still too soon to jump to conclusions. Let me take a look too, Madam Ch'en. I want to know what she's done. All of us need the truth.   
[name="Amiya"]  You want to know what kind of a person Talulah has become...
[name="Amiya"]  ...What I want to know... is who exactly is the person Reunion has been following.

Both Ch'en herself and Amiya would probably answer no when asked this question.
Ch'en has tried to run far away many times.
But she stopped herself.

Ch'en's memories and emotions, and each and every time she changed... All of it came from her determination.
To wield the Chi Xiao is to have a firm conviction. Ch'en has seen ups and downs through her journey and there were moments that she struggled with her own belief. Ch'en did not allow herself to stay depressed.
This can also be seen in her technique with the Chi Xiao.
Ch'en has made up her mind.

Amiya quietly tries to take this all to heart. Just as the memories she saw of Ch'en are slowly flowing into her heart, the warmth left on the scabbard is slowly fading away.
Amiya is being far calmer than she has ever been. She has made her decision.
She will take off the ring. She wants to see the truth.

And now, Ch'en is standing before Talulah.
The Chi Xiao holds steady in the air. The Draco's flames are extinguished the moment they graze the blade, as though it swallowed the blazing waves whole.
The two sisters, blood-related, are ready to settle their scores.
