[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  She destroyed Reunion alone, in just two and a half minutes.
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  She truly is a demon.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Just be glad that you didn't meet her five years ago. It's been a long time since I last saw her fight like this.
[name="Ch'en"]  What about the stragglers?

[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  They've already been captured by our various squads.

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_136_hsguma",focus=2)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I asked them if the warehouse was rigged.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_136_hsguma",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  If the entire warehouse is hooked up with explosives...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_136_hsguma",focus=2)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  We'll throw them in, one by one.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_136_hsguma",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  So?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_136_hsguma",focus=2)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Nothing. Phal made his way here after he was ambushed. Reunion originally was set up around here.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Ch'en, pull on the door's right side. I'll get the left.

[name="Ch'en"]  That wound... what happened to your eyes?
[name="Informant"]  I wasn't careful enough, got hit by Arts. Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter now. This... *cough*... is for you.
[name="Ch'en"]  Medic, staunch his bleeding!
[name="Informant"]  No... Madam Ch'en, there's no need. I've already accepted...
[name="Ch'en"]  Stop talking!
[name="Informant"]  It's true. Do you see how many times I’ve been shot? I'm blind, and don't want to move anymore. I've had enough of the pain. I'm so tired.

[name="Informant"]  Take it, Madam Ch'en... S249TA, F106.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  49. I've memorized the location.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Details are on the paper. The intel about Reunion's infiltration was not sent to the other leaders, but just to one party... There must be a reason behind it. You must look into it, the sooner the better.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I will.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  *cough*... It was no easy task for me to get this... Anyway, Madam Ch'en, I didn't expect things to end up like this.
[name="Informant"]  Even though I was finally able to make a contribution, I didn't think this would be how I did it...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  None of us did. Thanks to your bravery, we now have a chance to stop the enemy.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Haha... *cough*... I never liked Lungmen, and Lungmen never liked me.
[name="Informant"]  But now, I've finally managed to do something for Lungmen. Not bad for a bum like me, right...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  You're calling one of the Chung Shui Big Three a bum?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Compared to you, Madam Oni, I'm nothing more than a bum.
[name="Informant"]  ...
[name="Informant"]  ...Madam Ch'en, how's Madam Oni doing? Is she still working as Inspector?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  She is. She's been my partner for a long time.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Madam Ch'en, Madam Oni... is too honest and frank. No one in the gang... *cough*... dared to challenge her.
[name="Informant"]  But she is no match for those Lungmen moguls. Please keep an eye on her.
[name="Informant"]  Don't let anyone demean her. I won't let those stuck-up plutocrats insult her because of her background!
[name="Informant"]  This is the only favor I ask of you. Just one... *cough* *cough*...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Don't worry about that. Hoshiguma is very strong. No one can hurt her.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  No matter how powerful, everyone has their limits.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  The entire L.G.D. stands with her.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Good, that's a relief. Madam Oni, Madam Ch'en, I have no regrets now.
[name="Informant"]  Madam Ch'en, are you still here?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I am.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Am I a good person?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  A few years ago, a bit hard to say. But now you are, without a doubt. Lungmen is proud of having citizens like you.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Hahaha... *cough*... Haha... a pathetic Infected can be a good citizen?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Some people in Lungmen are indeed obsessed with Oripathy, but you'd be better off asking Lungmen directly.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  How do I do that? Will a city answer me?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Heh. I will, on its behalf.
[name="Ch'en"]  And it says, "I don't mind."
[name="Ch'en"]  Phal, you have always been - and always will be - one of Lungmen's best.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Thank you, Madam Ch'en. Thank you so much.
[name="Informant"]  Madam Chen, there are two things I'd like you to relay to Madam Oni.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  You should tell her yourself.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  What do you mean? Are you saying...
[Character(name="avg_npc_013")]
[name="Informant"]  ...Boss?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  It's me. I'm right here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_013")]
[name="Informant"]  Madam Ch'en, you should've told me sooner.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  She chose to not say anything.

[name="Informant"]  Boss, did I do a good job?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Not good enough. You can't call it a good job until you survive to see things through.
[name="Informant"]  Well damn, haha... I've already used up my luck to have you carry me on your back, Boss.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Anywhere you want to go? You always refused to tell me where you came from.
[name="Informant"]  Here, Lungmen. As a matter of fact, I've never been to other cities. If possible, just bury me in that old place.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  The hideout? But... that place is a complete wreck now, long deserted. To be honest, I'm not sure how I'd clean it up.
[name="Informant"]  It's okay. As long as I’m… with the others.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I will.
[name="Informant"]  Boss... Even though we've always been scared of you, we've also always... cheered you on.
[name="Informant"]  We've always... cheered...
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Same here.
