[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Based on our planned route, we should be approaching the central town of South Chernobog.
[name="Dobermann"]  We'll arrive at the rendezvous point after crossing this park. Assuming no contingencies, Nearl and Team E4 should be waiting for us there.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Guard"]   But...
[name="Guard"]   If Nearl was attacked... What would we do then?
[name="Guard"]   What if they wanted to alert us, but couldn't due to communications being jammed...
[name="Guard"]   How should we deal with that?

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]   We will go assess the situation.
[character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Guard"]   ...Oh...
[Character(name="char_014_riope",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Ace"]   Don't start speculating before seeing things with your own eyes.
[name="Ace"]   There's no point of letting paranoia get the better of you.
[Character(name="char_014_riope",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Guard"]   I, I see...
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Losing our communications has caused anxiety to spread through the ranks much faster than I imagined...
[name="Dobermann"]  Especially with this looming Catastrophe.
[name="Dobermann"]  We have to pick up our pace.
