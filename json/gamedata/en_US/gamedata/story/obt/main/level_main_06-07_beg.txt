[name="Pilot"]  This is your stop. Amiya and her people are nearby!
[name="Pilot"]  Was it really okay to drop the team outside the city? You're gonna go down there by yourself?!
[Character]
[name="???"]  Come on, it's a lot better for them to be out there clearing a path and pushing back Reunion's pursuit forces than to fight here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Pilot"]  Okay. The terrain down there is pretty rough. This is as far as I can take you.
[Character]
[name="???"]  It's fine.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Pilot"]  ...At least let me put down a rope for you?
[Character]
[name="???"]  When have you ever seen me use a rope?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Pilot"]  You're just gonna go for it again, huh?
[Character]
[name="???"]  Go for what? What are you talking about?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Pilot"]  Every time we have a mission together, you go off and do crazy stuff while I sit in the cockpit on pins and needles and watch.
[name="Pilot"]  I'm kind of used to it, but that doesn't change the fact that you're way too reckless out there.
[Character]
[name="???"]  That just goes to show you what a good rapport you, me, and my team have!
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Pilot"]  Rapport my ass! Last time you demolished a town, bombed out a reservoir, and collapsed a mine!
[name="Pilot"]  Keep the chaos on the ground please, don't bring it onto my baby!
[Character]
[name="???"]  Fine, fine. I got it. But, "Bad Guy," really? Maybe think a little harder next time you pick a name.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]

[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#4")]

[Character]
[name="???"]  I'm not like that Ch'en lady! Trust me, I can help you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Pilot"]  And how should we call you?
[Character]
[name="???"]  Use my codename. Call me Officer Swire!
