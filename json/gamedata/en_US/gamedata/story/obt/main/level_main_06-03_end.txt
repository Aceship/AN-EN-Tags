[name="Faust"]  The two of us, lone crossbowmen. If we both pull the trigger at the same time, we both die.

[name="GreyThroat"]  Codename GreyThroat. When did you get behind me?

[name="Faust"]  The third time you blinked.
[name="Faust"]  You're pretty direct...
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  You've been separated from your squad. I'm not here to kill people who don't want a fight.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  We're enemies.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Rhodes Island is here to save the Infected. I saw you helping them.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  Those were my comrades. You're my enemy.
[name="Faust"]  When did Rhodes Island hire someone so naive?
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Yes, I'm naive. All I can do is follow orders. I freeze up whenever I have to make a decision for myself.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  You need to be careful.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Watch your finger!
[name="GreyThroat"]  That's a single shot crossbow. If I dodge your bolt, you're dead. Don't pull that trigger.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  If you only follow orders, if you rely on everyone else to tell you what to do, that can only end poorly.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Why?
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  Most of the sheep who blindly take orders aren't actually dependent on anyone. They just haven't started thinking for themselves...
[name="Faust"]  And those who have no direction in life, they're just empty machines looking for a sense of accomplishment, and meaning.
[name="Faust"]  You activate, and perform your function, you input a goal, you achieve your goal, until you consume everything around you, and you consume those you serve.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I won't.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  You're inexperienced.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I saw your interaction with the Infected back there. You're doing the right thing.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  Your opinion means nothing to me.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Faust, you've been avoiding the L. G. D. Even the ones who are out here on their own, you haven't shot at them. I've been watching you.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  Don't take my patience for weakness. If I ambushed you, you'd be dead.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  But you didn't.
[name="GreyThroat"]  You're exhausted. Take it from a crossbowman, your string is drawn too tight. It's definitely going to snap. 
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  Take it from a crossbowman, you're too much.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  You've also seen those... special Infected. We can figure this one out together.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  Maybe you're right.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_367_swllow_1#4",focus=2)]

[name="GreyThroat"]  ......hm?
[name="GreyThroat"]  Why haven't you killed me?
[Character]
[name="Faust"]  You didn't shoot. Neither will I.
[name="Faust"]  But next time? If you don't kill me, I will kill you.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I don't want to hurt you!
[Character]
[name="Faust"]  That's too bad.
[name="Faust"]  I guess you need someone to answer you. Without an answer, you can't understand.
[name="Faust"]  Don't worry about it. Killing, dying, these are everyday facts of life. Even for Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Why can't we work together to save them?
[Character]
[name="Faust"]  I really wish I could. But I know I can't.
[name="Faust"]  Don't follow me.
[name="Faust"]  You still don't know them. You don't yet have the whole picture.
[name="Faust"]  ...and me? There's nothing I can do anymore.
