Logos pictures how the familiar ship treads mountains and rivers, its tracks giving off the same rumbling.
He remembers the first time he came to Rhodes Island and stood shoulder-to-shoulder on the deck with Theresa. She looked out over Kazdel, while he listened to the wailing in the wind.
He remembers Mechanist hunched over, fiddling with parts, chiding Closure for wasting materials. Outcast and Blaze betting on how long it would last, and a robotic arm reaching over to grab his hat.
He remembers Ace's bloodied palm by his shield and cup. Scout's palm was a little cooler, about the temperature of his crossbow, and he could tell them apart by shaking their hands and high-fiving.
He remembers the Doctor and Amiya saying goodnight in the corridors, when Amiya suddenly stopped him to ask if he was ready to go to Londinium.
He remembers Dr. Kal'tsit taking Amiya's hand and bringing her between them—
'Theresa is gone. Amiya is the new leader of Rhodes Island.'
Logos keeps falling—
Falling until he is completely submerged in cold water.
He remembers himself many years ago.

Shining removes the guard's mask.
She remembers the face. He was one of the first mercenaries that the Confessarii brought to Londinium.
They knew nothing at first. They were only tasked to excavate the ruins outside the city.

The young man had expressed his gratitude to her directly, thanked the Confessarii for giving them a safe, well-paid job.
It was not long before she stopped hearing those words.
The Leader of the Confessarii came to Londinium.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_147_shining_1#2$1")]
There were no more idle mercenaries drinking and playing games. Everyone put on the same mask, and did not speak except when necessary.
They had no special bloodline. Qui'sartuštaj should not have been able to control their will so easily.
But the part of them that belonged to themselves died before the great dreams of the Confessarii.
It was she who killed them first.

The mask cracks. The pieces stab at Shining's palm.
She continues her journey to the top.
