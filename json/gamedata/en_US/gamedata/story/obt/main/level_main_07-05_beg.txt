[name="Kal'tsit"]  We’ll begin the operation after we finish collecting all the environmental information. Before that, it’ll benefit you to hear exactly what’s going on inside Chernobog’s core city.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Amiya’s a bit tied up on the scene, so she won’t be able to join this discussion.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You’ve already read the information in the mission briefing, but that kind of information is not good enough for a mind like yours.
[Decision(options="Did you finally realize that you need me?;......;I’m glad you see me as more than a simple battlefield commander.", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If the worst comes to pass, I don’t want you to sacrifice yourself while still not knowing a single thing.
[Predicate(references="2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If you’ve taken interest in some part of me, you can just come out and say it. No need to stare so much.
[Predicate(references="3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You might not remember, but I do. I remember you had quite a talent for heating up rations by pouring boiling water directly into your mouth at four in the morning.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If you don’t believe me, you can try for yourself.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But skip the chatter. We don’t have much time.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Rhodes Island and the L.G.D. worked together to take down Reunion, and neutralized the forces controlled by Mephisto and Crownslayer.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  After that, Reunion’s deployments in Lungmen fell apart completely.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Amiya reported to me that you had a difficult fight with a “FrostNova,” an Infected serving Reunion as leader of a special squad, at the bottom of Lungmen.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The battle ended in your victory.
[Decision(options="There was no victor.;No.;I wouldn’t call that a victory.", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I understand. According to the data from PRTS, you had the cooperation of our operators when you brought the enemy’s body back to Rhodes Island for treatment.
[Decision(options="I don’t consider her an enemy.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Dr. {@nickname}, “distinguish your friends from your foes.”
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...No. You might get the wrong idea, but you must hear me out.
[Decision(options="......?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I am not trying to blame you, Dr. {@nickname}.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Amiya told me what happened between you and the enemy commander. Only those who were there at the time had the information to decide what to do.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I don’t have the right to overreach and criticize your judgment.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You tried to understand the motives of that Infected. You were willing to bear the consequences for the things she, FrostNova, did.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That is what you did.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If you plan to use this method to make sense of the suffering in this world, I have no reason to blame you.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I am even willing to vouch for you before the operators of Rhodes Island. Dr. {@nickname}, make your own decisions, and I will try not to interfere.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  After that, I will determine the part of the responsibility that belongs to Rhodes Island.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Your powers and responsibilities compliment one another. “Distinguish your enemies from your friends.” Those are your words, not mine.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ......
[name="Kal'tsit"]  (Whispers) If you really want to breathe as one...
[Decision(options="You’re actually... siding with me?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I never said that.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  More accurately, FrostNova and her Yeti Squad were a guerilla team of elite Infected. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Right now, there are still two elite forces that Reunion is still able to mobilize. These guerilla warriors are the first.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The second is the Sarkaz mercenary, W, and her team of sellswords.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  According to my intel, W used some underhanded tactics to seize leadership of the Sarkaz mercenaries working with Reunion.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We don’t have time to go over what should be common historical knowledge, but let me say this frankly — Sarkaz mercenaries are unreliable, a problem W faces just as much as Reunion.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Sarkaz mercenaries are unlike normal agency mercenaries. They are the overflowing military might of Kazdel, spilling out across the land.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Trying to control them is an act of folly. It will only anger the forces backing them.
[Decision(options="You seem to have a pretty deep understanding of the Sarkaz.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I haven’t even gotten to the important part.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The point is, the Infected guerrillas of Yeti Squad are completely different from the Sarkaz mercenaries.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  There are no similarities between them in terms of their form, organization, behavior, or creed.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Before joining Reunion’s ranks, they were an independent guerrilla force of Infected, and their prestige was even greater among certain groups of Infected than that of Reunion.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...And before they formed this guerrilla force, they used to be a part of the mighty Ursus military.
[Decision(options="The Guerrillas of the Northwestern Tundra?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I’m not sure where you learned that piece of information, Doctor, but I color me impressed.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Though that piece of information itself is fairly basic, I am relieved that you’re able to proactively gather intel on your own.
[Decision(options="You just had to tack that bit onto the end...;......;Why does it feel like you’re poking fun at me?", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I only give what you deserve.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We’ve arrived at the foundations of the industrial sector at Chernobog’s core city.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Next, we’ll lead three teams through the complex underground passages, take the sewer pipes into the industrial layer, and come up in the heart of the core city.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Be aware that any enemies you see patrolling these areas are not the ordinary Reunion thugs you’re used to fighting.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We will meet rigorously trained... “soldiers.” Reunion’s “soldiers,” trained in the tactics of Ursus’s own army by the guerrillas.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Our recon operators discovered that communication networks have been forcefully cut off within the core city. Rather, it seems that Reunion didn’t even try to maintain these channels.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  This is a severe constraint upon modern-day squads who rely on the most common modes of communication.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  What this means is Reunion either already has some special way of communicating, or they simply aren’t prepared to fight.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Based on what we saw in Chernobog a month ago, don’t expect that second scenario. However, if communication is cut off, the lower-ranking Reunion members won’t receive direct commands.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Most of the time, expect them to act independently.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I fear they won’t know signals they cannot receive— a signal that only countries and city-states can distinguish. One that marks the territory of Ursus.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  A terrible storm is brewing within this city. Chaos, whether caused accidentally or deliberately, will permeate everywhere like thick smoke.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  They’re a step ahead of me, and the seeds of ruin have already been sown.
[Decision(options="What’s your conclusion?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Conflict is brewing within Reunion.
[Decision(options="How are you so sure?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I’ve seen the same thing unfold countless of times across this land.
[Decision(options="Is there something you’re not telling me?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I’ve said pretty much everything I needed to say. As for the rest, we’ll cross those bridges when we get to them.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Even if we’re still just preparing for war, efficiency still matters.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Please help me notify the members of Team R-4, Doctor. Have them take these devices.
[Decision(options="Hold on...", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Is there a problem?
[Decision(options="Don’t these belong to Rosmontis?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Yes.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You seem to know more about Rosmontis than the conversation you had in the bioprocessing unit indicated.
[Decision(options="I saw her getting ready to fight.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Decision(options="Never expected she’d have the power to use a device like this.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Every elite operator has a considerable amount of strength. We expect them to take charge. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...So, you haven’t had the time to understand how Rosmontis fights.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But just to get this out of the way, there are some things they should not be shouldering alone. As a field commander, a necessary part of your job is to help relieve the pressure on these operators.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  In this upcoming battle, you may make some shocking discoveries.
[Decision(options="Huh...?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Very few people aren’t shocked after watching Rosmontis fight.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Make sure you’re ready for it.
