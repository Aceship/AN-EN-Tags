[name="???"]There is only one thing that you must do. Fulfill your duty.
For an instant, Allerdale forgets where she is, and who is with her.
She wants to run, towards the fire that is burning away at what little remains of her life.
Just like that night twenty-six years ago, when she wanted to run towards another fire to stop Parliament's men from taking her father.
[name="???"]That is your sole responsibility.
Allerdale's eyes open wide. The tears in them evaporate before the fire.
But she sees a great silhouette is rising in the burning garden.
Is it the damaged suit of steam armor? The steam armor upon which she placed so many dreams and hopes?
[name="???"]Return to the person of interest. Now.
Through so many trials and tribulations, Allerdale had prayed that her great ancestor would descend into the steam armor and help her overcome all challenges.
Now she sees the ancient armor breathing the flames of hell.
She sees the shadow in the fire roar towards her.
It is not her hope. She has strayed far from it.
Even if her ancestor truly returned—
Allerdale knows it could only be her worst nightmare.
