[name="Morgan"]Good omen, perhaps?
[name="Morgan"]Let's hope it all goes smoothly.
[name="Dagda"]Wonder if the Self-Salvation Corps arrived at Brentwood before us...
[name="Dagda"]We'll have even more hands once we join up with them.
[name="Dagda"]Who would have thought, a few days ago, that we would have our own army?
[name="Dagda"]I kind of like the name the Exemplars.
[name="Morgan"]Are you sure about this though, Vina? Are we bringing all of them back to Londinium?
[name="Morgan"]Very few of them are ready to fight the Royal Court head-on.
