Horn puts her hand on the crossbow she hid up in her sleeve.
If Mandragora shows any signs of lifting even a single finger, she will immediately pull the trigger.
Or perhaps... she could just pull the trigger now. That doesn't seem like a bad choice either.

Horn does not take her hand off her crossbow. Her glare closely follows Mandragora as she leaves.
A single bolt. From this distance, that's all it would take. All she has to do is pull the trigger, and her opponent's chest would be torn open, splattering blood everywhere, just like what happened to Cello.
