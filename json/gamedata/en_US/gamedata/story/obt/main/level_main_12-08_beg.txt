Siege huddles up on the sofa. She used to spend countless nights here. Every inch of it feels as familiar as ever.
She still remembers how they picked up this couch at the flea market all those years ago, the four of them breaking their backs to carry the bloody piece of tat all the way to the gym's upstairs.
She reckoned it pretty wide back then, but soon enough she was resting her feet on the armrest just to fit.
In the dark, Siege's hand brushes over the sofa, feeling each nook and cranny.
Here's the gash left from when Hannah was practicing with her knife. Three whole days she felt guilty about that.
Morgan spilled a whole bottle of drink here. She bought a tin of awful cleaning stuff to treat the stain and it got worse the more she tried. The whole patch is still smooth as a baby's bottom to this day.
Baird put the iron down here and forgot about it. Nearly burned the whole room down.

[name="Damazti Cluster"]Does becoming a member of a collective instill joy or pride in you?
[name="Damazti Cluster"]Regretfully, as you've seen, we can only belong to ourselves in the end.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_647_1#5$1",focus="l")]
[name="Golding"]No. I used to believe that...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Golding"]At first, I believed I fought for our shared dream, for the Self-Salvation Corps' cause.
[name="Golding"]In these past days, I've realized that might not have been the case.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_647_1#7$1",focus="l")]
[name="Golding"]Lettou was right. We are all the same kind.
[name="Golding"]I told him he was pessimistic... yet look at me. Whether I admit it or not... I'm someone who despairs easily myself.
[name="Golding"]The Corps' members may fight with pure ideals in heart, but the Corps itself does not.

[name="Golding"]Take Clovisia, or Allerdale... both women I respect for their character, yet their aims extend far beyond what they claim out loud.
[name="Golding"]For a very long time, I pretended to be blind to that.

[name="Damazti Cluster"]It disillusions you now. You finally realize your undertakings were marred since the start.
[name="Damazti Cluster"]You feel your efforts were all in vain.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Golding"]Hardly.
[name="Golding"]You see, I don't have any cause on my mind. I'm just thinking of the people. Faces upon faces.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_647_1#5$1",focus="l")]
[name="Golding"]Heidi, Feist, Rockrock, old Bill, Adams, little George...
[name="Golding"]I have no standing, and no right to say I should repent for the Self-Salvation Corps. I don't belong to any illusory collectives of that sort.
[name="Golding"]But I need... to come face-to-face with every one of them, inside myself.
