[name="Amiya"] It's enough.
[name="Amiya"] Madam Ch'en's emotions...
[name="Amiya"] They're flowing towards me from the Chi Xiao.
[name="Amiya"] Before, we didn't know each other at all. It's the things that happened here that have bound us together, the fate of the Infected that has brought us here...
[name="Amiya"] Because we believe that the coming dawn will always be better than today.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Hui-chieh is different from you, Cautus.
[name="Talulah?"] Rhodes Island is just a scarecrow for the various political entities. For them, you would kill your own kin while speaking of kindness, waiting for a chance to sow chaos for your own benefit. You don't care about the Infected at all.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] Who else do you want to kidnap? Are you still planning to feed those lies to Madam Ch'en?

[name="Amiya"] It's easy to see through your lies, since you only ever talk about the results and motivations, without ever saying what steps you take to achieve them! Your promise to Talulah was the exact same!
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Oh...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] You promised Madam Ch'en and Reunion that you would create a home for the Infected. You promised that the Infected would rise up after a great battle. But Talulah would never have made such a promise again.
[name="Amiya"] Because the first time she made that promise brought so much pain...

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5")]
[name="Ch'en"] That's fine, it's a bit more formal. Or is it too formal?
[name="Ch'en"] Sorry to drag you into this sisterly quarrel. I thought our reunion would be a little more dramatic... or at least a little more conventional.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] I think that no matter how conventional it is, the feelings we have when reuniting after a long time are one and the same.
[name="Amiya"] Is crying very clichéd? I don't think so. Any normal person would cry.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Very eloquent, Cautus. An impressive assault on the emotional front.
[name="Talulah?"] However, such a skill is better suited to persuade the royal court and senate, to subdue the parliament and those spineless bastards, to incite the blind soldiers and irascible citizens... rather than me.
[name="Talulah?"] 'Kazdel fell thrice to great fires. It was rebuilt multiple times, receiving millions of new souls and being reclaimed by the royal court each time. Yet, the previous residents have all been reduced to ashes in the wind.' 
[name="Talulah?"] In Chernobog, you once raised a barrier, stopping my breath... I let you go, because the noble warrior who sacrificed his life for you was worthy of my respect.
[name="Talulah?"] But now, you've caught my attention once more. You won't get another chance to escape.
[name="Talulah?"] Survive this immolation, Cautus.

[name="Talulah?"] It's genuine. Congratulations, Cautus.
[name="Talulah?"] You're not a fragment, not an experiment, not an impostor.
[name="Talulah?"] You are indeed the Lord of Sarkaz... the enemy of humanity.
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] No, I'm nothing but an Infected.
[name="Amiya"] A... person.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#3")]
[name="Ch'en"] I'm a bit... speechless.
[name="Ch'en"] Amiya, you... what kind of magic is that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] That doesn't matter right now...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4")]
[name="Ch'en"] Maybe. But actually, it matters a lot to me. Why are you holding a sword that looks so much like Chi Xiao? Why do you know the sword techniques that I've diligently practiced for over ten years? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] (Miss Ch'en... Is it that serious?!) 
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4")]
[name="Ch'en"] Nevermind, let's leave it for next time. How similar is this sword to Chi Xiao?
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] You can think of it as another Chi Xiao.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4")]
[name="Ch'en"] Alright, Amiya. How much of my sword techniques do you know?
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] All. All that I've seen, all that I've found within your heart, I know it all.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] ...What did you find in my heart?
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] Erm, Miss Ch'en... D-don't worry, I only saw those things that you wished for me to learn. I can distinguish these things. I-I really didn't look at anything else.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] Forget it all.
[name="Ch'en"] Wei Yenwu always said that handling Chi Xiao relies more on one's state of mind rather than one's mastery over the sword.
[name="Ch'en"] I always thought he was bullshitting, but I have to admit I'm unlikely to ever reach his level of swordsmanship.
[name="Ch'en"] So, you can just ignore him when he's waxing lyrical about cooperation and principles, but when it comes to the sword you must listen to us both!
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] Got it!
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Two swords. You actually had the gall to choose such an evil weapon like Chi Xiao.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] Since when have weapons been evil or not? What kind of weapon could be more evil than you?
[name="Ch'en"] Listen up, Amiya!
[name="Ch'en"] If your resentment and my fury are one and the same, then so too are our swords!
[name="Ch'en"] Let's go, Amiya! Take her down, dead or alive!
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] Huh?! Can we really...? 
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] Don't act like we have a choice!
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] You've gained so much confidence from such a weapon?
[name="Talulah?"] I've been through this tomfoolery once already today, and I don't fancy an encore.
[name="Talulah?"] Let's test your sword, Cautus. I'll see your skills for myself.

[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] That means...
[name="Amiya"] No. Talulah, Kashchey's Originium Arts didn't begin taking effect after his death...
[name="Amiya"] He had already been using his Arts on you from that moment on.
[name="Amiya"] Just think! How many of your thoughts has he twisted? How many memories has he warped?
[name="Amiya"] Even if he didn't tamper with your memories, he was still exploiting those fuzzy corners of your mind!
[name="Amiya"] Talulah, if you are still Talulah——
[name="Amiya"] Even if you wanted to start a war, even if you ended up sacrificing many people...

[name="Amiya"] If there had to be sacrifices, wouldn't you have let yourself be the first?

Ch'en looks at Amiya. The girl next to her is unrecognizable from the Amiya of ten minutes ago.

[name="Amiya"] Um, sorry. It's something like this, right?
[Dialog]
[Character]
Blue? Black... probably cerulean. It looks good. Compared to this, Chi Xiao is a lot bloodier.
At this moment, Ch'en considers that perhaps this battle should have just gone like this.
The oxygen supply devices have all been destroyed during the battle. To fight a fire dragon while carrying an oxygen supply is nothing short of suicidal.
With a huff, Ch'en discards her extraneous equipment and laments the fact that she was far too hasty with her preparations.
[Dialog]
[delay(time=1)]
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5")]
[name="Ch'en"] Amiya, there's not much time left. She's planning to burn off all the oxygen here.
The rabbit beside her is also a veteran of many battles. This reminder should have been unnecessary, but it's enough to divert her attention.
There's only one reason to do so. Ch'en wants to draw her attention. Ch'en breathes in deeply.
She's struggling to keep calm.
Refusing to be bound by its scabbard, the temporarily restrained Chi Xiao trembles violently, as if eagerly awaiting its release, to the point of madness.
Though, it may be because her own hand is shaking.
After all these years, only now... only now does Ch'en feel the tenacity of Chi Xiao. She fears that she will lose her grip on the sword, yet she is unable to stop herself from rejoicing together with it.
Ch'en comes to a realization. Chi Xiao possesses no will of its own. Its will is the will of the wielder.
It wasn't that she was unable to draw Chi Xiao before. She just hadn't reached a point where she needed to use it.
But now, as she faces a veritable wall of flames and the villain in front of her, the person she longed for, that friend, sister, criminal, along with a sense of total despair, it all weighs down heavily on her.
The trembling gradually stops. It's time, Ch'en feels. Chi Xiao has been waiting for far too long.
And she has, as well.
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] Miss Ch'en, please wait. We may be able to hurt her, but even if we have the power to do so—— Killing her is meaningless.
[Dialog]
[Character]
Amiya doesn't feel as if she is the one speaking.
She feels like a sharp blade, a sharp blade bent from injustice and tragedy. Even so, Amiya feels that this blade will return to its original shape, as sharp as ever.
She feels a little like Ch'en.
That's not a bad thing. She cannot actually be Ch'en, after all.
Amiya gazes at Talulah.
Miss Ch'en, did you arrest suspects just so you could flog and humiliate them? To take away their lives?
Yet, her nameless anger is nothing like Ch'en. She feels betrayal, manipulation, isolation. She is experiencing a story that has yet to reach its end, a gloomy future that which still exists.
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] That is just an outcome, I believe. Besides, we don't possess that authority.
[name="Amiya"] I know you'll say that just washing away her suspicions is too easy.
[name="Amiya"] No, Madam Ch'en... Miss Ch'en. That's not right.
[name="Amiya"] Whether or not her suspicions can be washed away must wait until this matter is resolved.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
Ch'en bites down hard on her lip, drawing blood. Why does she feel joy at blood kin harming one another? She cannot answer.
She stops herself from raising Chi Xiao.
She sighs.
[name="Ch'en"] Exactly. That's just an outcome. I want them to be judged for their crimes. Death can come after they are sentenced.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Where does your confidence stem from?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] It's not confidence, monster.
[name="Ch'en"] It's called responsibility.
Ch'en holds her head up high.
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] It's our duty.
[name="Amiya"] On the other hand, Kashchey, you possess nothing.
[name="Amiya"] Your body is borrowed. Your deceptions are laid bare. Your flames falter before Chi Xiao.
[name="Amiya"] You chose this place as your battlefield, relying on your weapons and disguise. Staying in the core city is proof of your arrogance and folly.
[name="Amiya"] You've driven yourself into a corner. You cannot escape.
