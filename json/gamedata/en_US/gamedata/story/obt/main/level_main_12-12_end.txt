Once again, out of habit, she puts her hand to the hilt.
She tries to feel some sort of energy from it, some sort of motivation. Even some kind of duty or preordained self-sacrificial destiny would be fine.
Again. And again. She is left disappointed.
What did she come back for? Just to experience all of this?
Or did all that expectation simply fall upon the wrong person when it chose her? Did this sword, and her teacher, foster too much of an illusion in her—to the point she thought she could be some kind of symbol?

The room is oppressively vacant. No one responds.
Delphine grips her dagger tight.
Her mother always admonished her for not putting more energy into combat training, but being the daughter of the Duke of Windermere of Victoria, her swordsmanship reputed, she's got the confidence to take on most enemies.

[dialog]
[charslot]
A tangled cord of wires comes into Delphine's view, but the device meant to attach to them has vanished without a trace.
All that's left on the table is a thick layer of dust.
Someone came and took the comms station away beforehand... <i>long</i> beforehand.
