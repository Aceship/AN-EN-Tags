[name="Kal'tsit"]  Assuming you’re talking about Rosmontis’s Arts, it may be time to explain it to you, now that you’ve seen it so many times.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It is a state of mind she shapes herself. You can think of it like Rosmontis has a gigantic, second, invisible body that cannot be acted upon.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It is a formless extension of her sense of touch. She can grab, squeeze, lift up, and toss away.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But these Arts lack objective manifestation, as opposed to her subjective mind.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It can act upon us with force, but we cannot act upon it. We only know it exists with the application of special Originium Arts.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You need not grasp it fully. This is not your area of expertise. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Rosmontis was much more destructive before we put a weapon in her hands. A lot like being crushed beneath the treads of a nomadic city. All that’s left is a crying young girl alone in the ruins.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen again.
