[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_222_bpipe_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"]I'm still unclear about their reasons right now.
[name="Horn"]The one thing I can be sure of is, if we want to continue investigating, we've only got ourselves to depend on. The attitude the barracks have is loud and clear—they won't be of any help to us whatsoever.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_222_bpipe_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Bagpipe"]Ugh. I'm not daft, either. I can see they've got a mean habit for trippin' people up.
[name="Bagpipe"]So what do we do next? We scarcely got a lead, and it's gone again.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#2",name2="avg_222_bpipe_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"]We need to think of some other way.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#2",name2="avg_222_bpipe_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Bagpipe"]Oh, yeah! I just thought. That man called Damian, he said his work was sortin' the potatoes.
[name="Bagpipe"]Every outer agriculture plate in a nomadic city has its own channel for transportin' crops inwards!
[name="Bagpipe"]We should be able to find the farmworkers' settlement by followin' along. If we can have a chat with his friends or kin, we might find our lead again.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_222_bpipe_1#7",focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_222_bpipe_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Bagpipe"]Then you just leave the information enquirin' to me!

[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1",name2="avg_222_bpipe_1#8",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"]I'll stay to negotiate with the barracks. To my mind, they wouldn't slop out an execution without going through interrogation. As long as they held one, there'll be records left behind.
