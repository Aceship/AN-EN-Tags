[name="Duke of Caster"]Ambitious? I think you mean <i>crazy</i>.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1337_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Flag Officer"]Yes... crazy. He wants the entire allied forces committed to the front lines — thirteen dreadnoughts, forty-five assault ships, one hundred seventy-two gunboats...
[name="Flag Officer"]Eighty-six transports, ten support ships, all our artillery, and one hundred eighty thousand infantry, including the entire reserves.
[name="Flag Officer"]It wasn't an inquiry or request. It was a notice, almost an order.
[name="Flag Officer"]The Duke of Wellington has also abandoned the traditional Gaulish formation of multiple battle lines, instead having all fleets form single files to penetrate the Nachzehrer line all at once.
[name="Flag Officer"]Gododdin and our forces are to be responsible for fire support and clearing out casters in the Sarkaz rear, while Wellington's vanguard charges at the center of the Nachzehrer formation.
[name="Flag Officer"]The Silverrock Bluffs, currently under Sarkaz control, is a key pass between the Redmane Mountains and the Duskglow River, and a highly defensible position.
[name="Flag Officer"]The enemy can easily retreat towards Londinium, even if we win the battle.
[name="Flag Officer"]I would have staunchly opposed the plan, if it was not Wellington who proposed it.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_726_1#5$1",focus="l")]

[name="Flag Officer"]However, our war scholars deem any losses from Sarkaz Catastrophe attacks to be within acceptable limits.
[name="Flag Officer"]Those losses will not compromise our ability to achieve our strategic objective.
[name="Flag Officer"]The Sarkaz have not refueled Londinium since it deviated from course. The city is immobile as of now.
[name="Flag Officer"]Once we take the pass at Silverrock Bluffs, the Sarkaz will no longer have a terrain advantage, and the allied fleets will have a clear path to Londinium.
