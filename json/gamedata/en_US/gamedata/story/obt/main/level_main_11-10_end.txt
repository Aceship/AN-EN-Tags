[name="Morgan"]This sword... I've only heard of it in the stories.
[Character(name="avg_npc_397_1#1$1")]
[name="Allerdale"]It was the sword of the Aslan forefathers.
[name="Allerdale"]As the legend goes, it was forged for the Aslans by the fairy of the grasslands. A pasha of yore once beheaded the Poltergeist King with it.
[name="Allerdale"]Then, the Aslans came to Victoria to rule, and it became the symbol of their reign.
[name="Allerdale"]According to some historical records, in the days before the nomadic cities came to be, the kings once cleaved Catastrophes with it.
[name="Allerdale"]For centuries, there was not a single storm to threaten Londinium.
[Character(name="avg_npc_397_1#8$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_397_1#8$1")]
[name="Allerdale"]That is in fact not a fabrication to legitimize the Aslans' reign. It really can cleave Catastrophes.
[name="Allerdale"]If The Shard, with its ability to pull in storms, is Victoria's spear against the outside world, then the Sighs of Kings, capable of rending Catastrophes asunder, is its strongest shield.
[Character(name="avg_npc_397_1#1$1")]
