[name="Rhodes Island Operator"] Dagda, Indra, we’ve got incoming! I'd suggest we bail!
[Character(name="avg_npc_396_1#1$1")]
[name="Dagda"]  Got it.
[Character(name="avg_155_tiger_1#9$1")]
[name="Indra"]Grr... They sure move fast.
[Character(name="avg_npc_396_1#1$1")]
[name="Dagda"]  You were in charge of recon, you didn't spot anyone nearby?
[Character(name="avg_155_tiger_1#6$1")]
[name="Indra"]Too much work. We'll just take 'em out as they come.
[Character(name="avg_npc_396_1#7$1")]
[name="Dagda"]  Balin... please stay hidden. Indra and I will take care of the incoming hostiles.

[name="Londinium Citizen"]Ladies, p-please save me! I don't want to fall into their hands again!
[Character(name="avg_155_tiger_1#6$1")]
[name="Indra"]Gah, shut your trap and do a better job of hiding.
[Character(name="avg_155_tiger_1#1$1")]
[name="Indra"]Dagda, we're good as long as we bring back the objectives, right? Shouldn't be an issue if we take apart this blasted lump of metal, yeah?
[Character(name="avg_npc_396_1#1$1")]
[name="Dagda"]  This is one story you're gonna have to tell Siege when we get back.
