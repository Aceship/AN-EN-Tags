[name="'Kazimierzian'"]I often feel that the times change with irregularity.
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]Their means of coming up with concepts so brilliant, their methods of forming societies so diverse, it's all dizzying.
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]I've lived in Kazimierz many times, and every time I leave, I end up coming back. To tell you the truth, Banshee, traces of us are still present in that land of knights.
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]I must admit the place is indeed fascinating.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_650_1#1$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_624_1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]Because it's much quieter here, and it's Kazimierz as I first saw it.
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]Golden farmlands amid the never ending plains. It's a pity that these are probably no longer important to the Kazimierz of today.
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]What do you think, how does it compare to Kazdel?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_650_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Logos"]Kazdel is a land of ruin, but the rubble also means that there are countless possibilities beneath it.

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_624_1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]And as for Kazimierz, it evolved so fast that in the blink of an eye, the Pegasi along with their morals and glory dispersed and withered away.
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]And it became even sweeter, more fascinating...
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]The descendants of the Elders and the Ancients accuse us Sarkaz of devouring their flesh and blood, and enslaving their souls. So they found a new method, and they did it even better than us.
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]They let those under their rule be fed, swallowed, turned into nourishment for their monster to continue expanding and grow.
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]And all they have to pay is a promise of the pleasures of life.
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]I searched for Kazimierz's rulers, intrigued by what they had created, but instead I only discovered...
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]No, there was no ruler, those company spokesmen, those members of the General Chamber of Commerce, even the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi or the Grand Knight, you could not call any of them a ruler of Kazimierz.
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]Inflated desire is so powerful that it can rule itself.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_650_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Logos"]Is a simple thirst for survival enough to keep up with your search, Damazti?
[name="Logos"]You're more restless than I imagined, what exactly are you afraid of?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_624_1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'Kazimierzian'"]Of sinking, deep into the past and history.

[name="Kal'tsit"]I won't pretend to be the type who hides in the shadows and gropes in the direction of history, although sometimes I do hope that things go my way.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I... and my past selves have tried many approaches. Some have been successful, while others in hindsight have proven to be questionable.

[name="Kal'tsit"]W, I... I destroyed Kazdel once. The me that I was then believed that it was the only way to bring peace.
[name="Kal'tsit"]We managed to behead The Lord of Fiends then, and we were victorious, for all intents and purposes. According to our plans, we should have reclaimed the King's authority.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I had prepared all kinds of plans, and the successors were under my supervision.
[name="Kal'tsit"]But at that moment Theresa... chose to pick up the black crown.
[name="W"]Hey, I'm not here for a history lesson.
[name="W"]But I'm awful curious, Kal'tsit. Why did you and her put Babel together anyway? What exactly do the Sarkaz mean to you?
[name="W"]If you're just trying to play with our lives, she... Theresa wouldn't be on your side.
[name="Kal'tsit"]We found that, in actuality, the Sarkaz aren't so different than the rest of us as we had originally thought. Not inferior to any other race, nor nobler than any other existence.
[name="Kal'tsit"]No matter where we've come from, Originium has changed us all into a similar form, possessing the same emotions and desires.
[name="Kal'tsit"]This land is currently in an ugly state. The Sarkaz souls whisper of being the former masters of this world, and they were slaughtered, oppressed, displaced for countless millennia.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I have seen the times of old. I was there when only Sarkaz walked on the land.
[name="Kal'tsit"]In fact, the term 'Sarkaz' actually originates from an arrogant abbreviation of their murderers, though it has also become a rallying cry for the victims.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The difference between a Djall and Goliath is huge, and so is the stark contrast in appearance between a Cyclops and a Diαblo, but why have they all been classified as common 'Sarkaz?'
[name="Kal'tsit"]If a Vampire establishes his own country, how would it be any different from the arrogant Victoria of today? If a Nachzehrer were to rule all civilization, how would the culture be any different from those under the ice-cold rule of Ursus?
[name="Kal'tsit"]Theresa and I came to the conclusion that these conflicts ultimately lead nowhere.
[name="Kal'tsit"]She dived so deep into the Lord of Fiends' memories, and realized what I had feared was indeed possible.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Our time... or rather, all time for these lands, this world, is running out.
