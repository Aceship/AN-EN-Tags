Pipes. They are buried deep underground with no end in sight.
These pipes connect the entire city. They are the veins of Londinium. It is through them that the energy is supplied to Londinium's heart, and that is where we are right now.
Never fear the darkness before your eyes. When the sun sets at night, the shadows live on in the city's veins.
When the light is taken, you trust your ears, your nose, and your remaining senses.
Listen carefully. The mechanical rumble is the flow of its blood. The gears rotate rhythmically like breathing.
[PlaySound(key="$blooddrop")]
Indeed, Londinium is alive. Even if we do not sit on its tall throne, it lives on as its own organism.
If you ever find yourself here again one day... no matter what may be chasing you, you needn't be afraid.
After all, you run through the body of Londinium.
Vina, you are home.

[name="Horn"] Don't be so alarmed. Keep your head up. Take your hand off the crossbow, and relax a little.

[name="Horn"] The residents here are used to seeing all kinds of people. They won't help us, but as long as they don't feel their lives are in danger, they won't follow Dublinn or the Sarkaz's orders.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"] Life under the enemy's watchful eyes... I can't imagine going through that.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"] Do you know how they used to think of us?
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"] Uh, I haven't thought about it.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"] I never did either.

[name="Londinium Citizen?"] Lieutenant...?
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"] Alright, stop calling me Lieutenant. I'm Horn here. There are way too many lieutenants running around, of all different factions.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"] Right, Horn. Where are we going?
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"] To regroup with my companions first.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"] The Sarkaz patrol will pass by the area in five minutes. We'll split into two teams and follow the rail tracks east separately.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"] After three hundred and fifty meters, you'll see an iron staircase leading up.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"] If you hear five metallic knocks, come on up. Three, stay put. Two, disband immediately.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"] You might think the abandoned factories there look familiar... Don't be surprised. It's Dublinn's stronghold.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"] Isn't that a little dangerous?
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"] With Dublinn occupying the area, the Sarkaz don't go there often.
[Character(name="avg_4039_horn_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_413_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Horn"] Want to try your hand at hide-and-seek? You're welcome to join in on the fun.
