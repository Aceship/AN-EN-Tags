As the two argue, Siege and Baird look on, then make brief eye contact, and break into laughter, shaking their heads.
If you overlook the sealed-up entrance, the boarded-up windows and the weariness in their expressions, it might all seem like nothing's changed.
But everyone knows deep inside. 'We haven't changed' is self-consolation at most, a kind of illusion.
Every minute and second that's ever passed has left an unquestionable mark on them.
