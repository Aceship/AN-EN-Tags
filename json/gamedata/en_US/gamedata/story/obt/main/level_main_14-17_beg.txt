[name="Priestess"]I had wanted to share a few things I had been keeping in your stead with you.
[name="Priestess"]The things that you once described to me, your ideas and vision that you have completely forgotten.
[name="Priestess"]I wanted to let you know all that we had accomplished.
[name="Priestess"]Perhaps this would have helped you to remember the past, remember me.
[name="Priestess"]But I can see what you are thinking, sense what you are feeling.
[name="Priestess"]You are still plagued by endless doubts, even now.
