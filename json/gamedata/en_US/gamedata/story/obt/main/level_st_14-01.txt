Theresa's voice is very soft, almost like a dream melted away in water. As a cloud of mist rises, the brief, momentary smile that she had before now seems distant and hazy.
The young Cautus girl thinks that, for a moment or two, the woman holding her hand all this time almost seemed to have disappeared into the mist herself.
And so Amiya makes the effort to stand on her tiptoes and stretches her hand out. The young girl's soft fingertips touch the forehead between the eyes of the King of Sarkaz; she tries to smooth those knitted brows.

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1296_1#3$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1296_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Theresa"]Because if the puppet made it through the desert, hope would start to spread their way, and they would disappear.

[name="Theresa"]The puppet made it past their traps and foiled their plans. All the tricks they had up their sleeves had failed. They were furious, and they decided they weren't going to hide anymore. They were going to duke it out with the puppet and fight him to the death.
[name="Theresa"]When he saw the shadows rushing toward him, the puppet took out a long spear made of a needle and some threads. Then, he—
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1295_1#1$1",focus="l")]

[name="Theresa"]The black-cloaked shadows watched the puppet walk into the distance. They decided they'd let the puppet give it a shot, but... a big river stood before him.
[name="Theresa"]He didn't even know how wide it was. All he knew was that he couldn't see the other side of the river.
[name="Theresa"]He knew that the Plains of Hope were on the other side, but there weren't any boats nearby. There wasn't even a decently sized frond.
[name="Theresa"]'What do I do now?' The puppet thought to himself, and he decided to see if he could swim across.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1295_1#3$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1296_1#8$1",focus="r")]

The pulsing of the myriad souls is ceaseless. Theresa lightly closes her eyes to bear with its surge.
The endless murmurs are like the tide. It exhausts, it drags those within it ever downward, and it suffocates.
Perhaps within it once existed brief moments of happiness or the occasional delight... but there is simply too much pain... so much that the pain permeates every word and sentence.

The Feranmut's skeleton wriggles its body and once again dives straight into history.
The fragments of time are like bubbles in a muddled stream. After they break up, the remains are still vague and indistinct.
Amiya feels the rippling spacetime rushing past her. You look at her and see her eyelashes twitching. What exactly does she see?
Perhaps nothing more than reflections passing by, or fleeting hallucinations.
The distance between memories and history is always much longer than we expect.

Countless sceneries, both ancient and modern, sweep by under the Feranmut's frame.
Those who find themselves within are astonished by this advancement or regression of times, the disasters that unfold before them, and the happiness in their hands...
But when looking upon them from high above, perhaps these sights have never actually changed.
Then, the illusion grows much stranger and more twisted.
A seed is rapaciously absorbing nutrients. It writhes, whimpers, trying to tear away all fabricated representation.
This creation, far beyond human comprehension, waits silently. The slightest movement is enough to rend the continent and allow the crystals to proliferate.
