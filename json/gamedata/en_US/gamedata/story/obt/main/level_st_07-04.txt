[name="Kashchey"]  I can return her to you, Wei.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ...
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Stop!
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ...Don’t do it.
[name="Kashchey"]  Oh? You and your mighty executioners have made my life hell.
[name="Kashchey"]  Of course I’m willing to return her to you... But the cuffs on her body will tear Lungmen in half.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Damn you...
[name="Kashchey"]  Wei, this is the method you used against me. The way you forced me out of Lungmen.
[name="Kashchey"]  But now, our roles are reversed. I’m the guest, as well as the poisoner.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Kashchey. You killed my brother.
[name="Kashchey"]  No, no, Wei. You slew your own brother.
[name="Kashchey"]  My role is irrelevant. Your brother’s tragedy may have come from a Unicorn’s secret orders, or from the wrath of a Lung. Whether it was me who leaked the news... ultimately, does not matter.
[name="Kashchey"]  What’s important, Wei, the one thing you mustn’t forget... is that your Chi Xiao drank his blood. You did it.
[name="Kashchey"]  Chi Xiao, the dragonslaying sword. And who is it that this blade slew? Your friends. Your family. Your people.
[name="Kashchey"]  Dragonslaying sword? How ironic that your people forged a weapon that would be turned against its own kind.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  You’ve gone too far.
[name="Kashchey"]  Very well. I offer you a choice.
[name="Kashchey"]  Choose. Slay me, and take back your niece, but lose your city as a result. Or, let us walk free.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ...
[name="Kashchey"]  Don’t draw that sword. You know the consequences.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  (Grinds teeth audibly)
[name="Kashchey"]  Relax, Wei. I’ve let you choose your own fate. If you don’t take my generous offer, then you and I both, all your citizens, and these two lovely sisters... will all perish.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  What are you scheming?
[name="Kashchey"]  Wei, old Wei... I know you well. Too well.
[name="Kashchey"]  You’ve always had a choice, isn’t that right?
[name="Kashchey"]  What will your precious citizens think when they hear that their lives have been placed upon a scale? And on the other side... is a young dragon whose name they’ve never heard.
[name="Kashchey"]  As for me, I don’t even have a reason to hurt her.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ...Since I was negligent enough to let you step foot back into this city, there’s no reason to let you leave again.
[name="Ch’en"]  Tal!
[name="Kashchey"]  Oh really?
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ......
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I’ll kill you myself.
[name="Kashchey"]  Now, now. There’s no need for that.
[name="Kashchey"]  My life is not yours to take.

[name="Kashchey"]  By the way, you can save her before I put the handcuffs on her.
[name="Kashchey"]  But you’ll also have to think about defending against me. Defeating me. Striking me down. Annihilating me... And, what I am going to do next.
[name="Kashchey"]  Wei, you’re actually afraid of me, aren’t you?

[name="???"]  Confessarius, answer me.
[name="???"]  The Leader of Reunion, is there any value in forming an alliance?

[name="Confessarius"]  Why ask me about things that you know very well, Your Majesty?
[name="Confessarius"]  A youth with no possessions, background, or capital cannot possibly seek to take an important Ursus city alone.
[name="Confessarius"]  The uninfected rulers know not what to make of her actions.
[name="Confessarius"]  They will panic, overreact, and try to resolve the chaos through more destruction — and use the chaos caused by the Infected as a front.
[name="Confessarius"]  But, we Sarkaz know better.

[name="Regent"]  What do you think of the team she finally left here?
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]  They are unworthy, Your Majesty. As you foresaw, there is no hope for them. They are not trained soldiers, unable to cause the violence that we seek.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062")]
[name="Regent"]  Eliminating them will not sever Talulah’s power. We lack an opportunity to take her out.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]  Right, Your Majesty.
[name="Confessarius"]  The situation that she fomented and the power she wielded to force the issue... shows that she is no one-eyed leader among the blind, or some pampered princeling awaiting the throne.
[name="Confessarius"]  She is a conspirator.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062")]
[name="Regent"]  Even if that is the case, I require a comprehensive response from the Sarkaz.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]  In that case, I have two bits of good news. First, we already have a lead on our search for the Lord of Fiends.
[name="Confessarius"]  Rhodes Island hasn't yet been manipulated by foreign forces.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062")]
[name="Regent"]  Don’t waste time. We need her to begin right now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]  Please do not be angered, and hear me out.
[name="Confessarius"]  “She” is ready.
