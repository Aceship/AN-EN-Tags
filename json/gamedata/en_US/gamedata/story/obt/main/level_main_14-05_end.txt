Babel was merely a temporary refuge, no different from the countless others before it. Or so W had believed.
True, there was always clean food and water, the badly wounded were not just left to die, and there were a few interesting guys around.
But at the end of the day, it was all the same. Just a place to stay.
It was not the first time W had lost her home, before she joined up with Hoederer and Ines.
Sometimes, she would return to camp and find it in flames. Sometimes, she was the one who set it on fire.
It was what she was used to. No Sarkaz truly believes in peace and quiet. Destruction was the norm. Conflict was the spice of life.
But when she saw the collapsed columns, the blood stains in the corridors, and the doctors yelling instructions...
For the first time, she felt a profound sense of... collapse.
