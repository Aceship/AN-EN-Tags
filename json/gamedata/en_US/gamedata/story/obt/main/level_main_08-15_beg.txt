[name="Infected Fighter"] Here we are.
[name="Infected Fighter"] ...You don't need to bother yourself with this, Talulah. The tractor's been missing for months. They were probably stopped by the Patrol Unit. There's not much we can do about it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_078")]
[name="Talulah"] Even if all we can do is find their bodies, we'll at least be giving their families some closure.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected Fighter"] If the intel recon gave us is correct, this should be the area where they'd gone missing.
[name="Infected Fighter"] ......
[name="Infected Fighter"] Talulah, snap out of it! Everything they said is just a load of horseshit.  
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] I'm fine.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected Fighter"] They're just a bunch of heartless bastards... Don't let it get to you!
[name="Infected Fighter"] None of them had the willpower to keep going, to leave the tundra! They fought so many battles with you, and they thought you a coward?! You're the most fearless soldier among us!  
[name="Infected Fighter"] Talulah, trust me. All of us follow you by will!
[name="Infected Fighter"] Captain Buldrokkas'tee used to be an Ursus soldier, but we all know he's the most steadfast man we have! All of us trust him!  
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] Not necessarily. He's strong. Way too strong. Stubborn, too. The people who didn't trust him were just afraid to speak up. 
[name="Talulah"] It only takes a brief moment for trust to completely crumble. If all the people who followed Patriot died one day, would the ones who come after them be as steadfast as them? 
[name="Talulah"] Rumors can destroy us. Before there are rumors, those who are innocent are innocent, and those who are skeptical of others are also innocent. 
[name="Talulah"] But no one is innocent once rumors begin to spread.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected Fighter"] But what does your upbringing has to do with anything?! You've done so much for all of us!  
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] It's fine. Calm down. 
[name="Talulah"] Besides, I haven't really done all that much for them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected Fighter"] Come on, don't say that.
[name="Infected Fighter"] Are you sure you want to go by yourself? Faust has been tagging along with those crossbow guys lately, and he's really getting the hang of it. If the guerrillas aren't around, you could bring them with...

[name="Talulah"] Protecting the Infected traveling with us is our top priority. We aren't fighting this war just to fight a war. Our goal is to help our fellow men survive. Don't put the cart before the horse.

[name="Talulah"] Know this by heart, and make sure everyone else does as well.

[name="Talulah"] I'm not even sure if it is unexpected things that I'm worried about or a repeat of those tragedies.

[name="Talulah"] They had families, they had friends, they had places they wanted to be... There's not even anything left of them. Infected often die and leave no traces left of their existence behind. That happens way too often, but now there isn't even a way for us to find out where their ashes have gone.

[Character(name="avg_npc_078#4")]
