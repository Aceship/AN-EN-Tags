A black line pierces through Salus's body once again and strikes the altar's core at the same time.
The Blood of Teekaz stills.

She stretches out her broken hand towards that drop of blood.
A curse known only to the Confessarii, inflicted upon the soul, upon all blood and flesh—

Salus smiles and throws herself onto the still heart.
The Blood of Teekaz boils.
A giant crimson vortex appears from the altar's core—

By Qui'sartuštaj, by the crowned without names, by the howling myriad souls... and the one she is most familiar with.
