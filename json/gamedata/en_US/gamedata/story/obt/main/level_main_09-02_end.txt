[name="Outcast"]That's a lovely name. I'm gonna guess you're old enough to drink?
[name="Janie"]I've long since been of age, La... Lass.. Outcast. I'm serving, after all.
[name="Outcast"]Oh? That gray Victorian military uniform sure falls flat under your shimmering blonde hair. Oliver, count yourself lucky. No matter how dull and cloudy it gets, you've always got your sunshine indoors.

[name="Operator Oliver"]Haha... true, true. Little Janie's brought us a mound of happy days.

[name="Janie"]Listen to you, Uncle Oliver. You're the ones all kindly letting me in while I've snuck off from the barracks.
[Character(name="avg_npc_245_1#1")]
[name="Outcast"]I was actually a tiny bit surprised, seeing you get along as well as you do—
[name="Outcast"]Jane, if all Victorian soldiers were as lovable as you, we'd lose at least half of those awful rumors making their way across our world.
[Character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#3$1")]
[name="Janie"]Thank you, if I haven't misunderstood. I assume those are compliments...
[Character(name="avg_npc_245_1#1")]
[name="Outcast"]Even on my way here, I saw some not-so-pretty sights. But anyhow, that's not gonna dampen the joy of meeting all of you here.
[Character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#7$1")]
[name="Janie"]I'm very glad... I could meet you too!

[name="Outcast"]Well, then, a toast to our encounter?
[name="Outcast"]I came here in kind of a hurry, so I could only bring some regular old gin, with way too much lemon because that's how I like it. You folks might find it too sour—
[Character(name="avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Shredder"]We don't really drink... on work hours.
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Operator Oliver"]You killjoy!
[Character(name="avg_npc_245_1#6")]
[name="Outcast"]Alright, that's on me for being sloppy. As a Rhodes Island Operator, I can't be an exception. Let's just have some tea.
