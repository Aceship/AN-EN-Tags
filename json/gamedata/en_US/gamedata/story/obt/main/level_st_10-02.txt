Rust, grease, but she can smell another scent.
She knows it. The odor of death.
The sewers are a tomb for the insects living in nomadic cities.
The wealthy construct cemeteries inside the cities where land comes at a premium, and the commoners, with little to their name, have no choice but to cast ashes out beyond the city orbits.
And the insects? They die without a word in the cracks between the plates. They die where the sun will never shine upon them.
[name="???"]Do you dare walk to your death? Should you have the courage to die, that is all you need to be granted a new life.
[name="Mandragora"]......
[name="Mandragora"]Leader...
She just needs to crawl to her left, scant inches, and she'll clamber into the sewers... like back then.
And there on her right... just on her right.
Her Taran compatriot stares with eyes wide open, gazing silently upon her.
[name="Mandragora"]Sorry, Leader.
[name="Mandragora"]This time...
[name="Mandragora"]It's me... who doesn't need you.
She uses the last of her strength to push her right hand out. Her touch alights on her old friend, changed beyond recognition.
[name="Mandragora"]No one's... after us now. Let's go home.

Someone stands before her. No firelight by his feet, pitch black reflected from his dagger.
Mandragora grins.
In her mind, she has met the true Death.
