[name="Liskarm"]   All clear!
[name="Liskarm"]   Confirming that it's safe over over here!

[name="Franka"]   Where's the enemy commander?

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]

[name="Liskarm"]   ...Not with their main force.

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]

[name="Franka"]   The enemy is lurking... we're being followed and watched.
[name="Franka"]   Are they trying to wear us down until they have the perfect opportunity to strike?


[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=2)]

[name="Amiya"]   Reunion is no stranger to sneak attacks.
[name="Amiya"]   We learned this the hard way at Chernobog.
[name="Amiya"]   Let's fall back quickly...

[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=1)]

[name="Liskarm"]   I can't guarantee the safety of the escape route.
[name="Liskarm"]   We'll be in danger if they start demolishing the nearby buildings to block the road.

[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#7", focus=2)]

[name="Amiya"]   Hurry, let's see what other routes we can take. The stealthier, the better!

[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1")]

[name="Liskarm"]   Amiya, how about taking that staircase to our 4 o'clock down?

[Character(name="char_106_franka_1")]

[name="Franka"]   That's a difficult route.

[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2")]
[name="Reunion Member"]   Aaargh! Rhodes Island!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]

[name="Amiya"]   It's an ambush! Watch out!

[name="Misha"]   Madam...
[name="Misha"]   There are some Infected kids... still in the slums.
[name="Misha"]   If possible...
[name="Misha"]   I hope that you can take care of them...

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=1)]

[name="Ch'en"]   Our duty is to protect Lungmen.
[name="Ch'en"]   The Infected are not considered citizens of Lungmen.

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=2)]

[name="Misha"]   ...

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=1)]

[name="Ch'en"]   ...
[name="Ch'en"]   However, citizens or not, the Infected still belong to Lungmen.
[name="Ch'en"]   I have no obligation to promise you anything, but I will perform my duty.
[name="Ch'en"]   After all...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=2)]

[name="Misha"]  They said they used to...

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=1)]=
[name="Ch'en"]   It's something we've always been doing.

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=2)]

[name="Misha"]   ...
[name="Misha"]   Thank you...

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=1)]

[name="Ch'en"]   ...
[name="Ch'en"]   Do you know why we've been searching for you?

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=2)]

[name="Misha"]   ...I'm not sure.
[name="Misha"]   I can't think of any reason why you'd want me.
[name="Misha"]   But I have a feeling...
[name="Misha"]   That this isn't about me...
[name="Misha"]   ...It's about my parents.


[Character(name="char_010_chen_1", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=1)]

[name="Ch'en"]   ...Yes.
[name="Ch'en"]   Your father was the most famous scientist in Chernobog.
[name="Ch'en"]   As well as one of the most important political figures there.
[name="Ch'en"]   Perhaps, there's something you might know...
[name="Ch'en"]   ...
[name="Ch'en"]   But even if that isn't the case...
[name="Ch'en"]   We cannot allow you to fall into Reunion's hands.

[name="W"]   Don't take this personally...
[name="W"]   But I have a very interesting plot in my hands.
[name="W"]   To make things more entertaining, I'll need you all to participate.
[name="W"]   Now, let us begin.
