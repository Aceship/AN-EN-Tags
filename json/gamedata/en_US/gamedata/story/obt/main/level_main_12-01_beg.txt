'Our preliminary conclusion is that the weapon in question is indeed the structure that briefly appeared in the skies over Londinium.'
'Based on frontline evaluation from the remote observation team, the weapon's powerful mid-air suspension abilities and the efficiency of its Originium Arts generator deserve due caution.'
'It is impossible to evaluate the Sarkaz's technological base for manufacturing large-scale armed aerial vehicles given the information we currently have. We are in the process of gathering more intel.'
