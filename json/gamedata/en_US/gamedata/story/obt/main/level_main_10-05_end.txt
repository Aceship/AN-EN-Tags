[name="Feist"]Rockrock, we don't have enough hands. There are many places above us where people can hide, and we still haven't checked at least a third of Sudean.
[name="Feist"]You know Harmo and the gang are getting ready for the move already. In a couple days, they will be leaving this place, and so will the commander.
[name="Feist"]When that happens, even if our team stays, our chances of rescuing anyone will be slim.
[Character(name="avg_4040_rockr_1#10$1",name2="avg_npc_402_1#6$1",focus=1)]

[name="Feist"]They aren't joining us... They're cooperating with us.
[name="Feist"]Didn't you hear the commander? They're friends of a friend. We accepted our friend's request and helped them enter Londinium, and they're here now.
[name="Feist"]And if they can help us look for people...
[Character(name="avg_4040_rockr_1#10$1",name2="avg_npc_402_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Rockrock"]They can rest up in our hideout. That's the commander's order.
[name="Rockrock"]And once they're done resting up, they'll leave this place. I'll escort them to somewhere safe aboveground, and that'll be the end of it.
[Character(name="avg_4040_rockr_1#10$1",name2="avg_npc_402_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Feist"]Why can't we ask them if they're willing to stay for a short while? It'll just be a small favor. They might not turn us down.

[name="Rockrock"]They sneaked into Londinium with a bunch of highly skilled Sarkaz, and they're making an enemy of those other Sarkaz... Feist, we're Victorians. We're used to this.
[Character(name="avg_4040_rockr_1#10$1",name2="avg_npc_402_1#4$1",focus=2)]

[name="Rockrock"]Ever since we were born, they've been fighting amongst themselves to no end. If it wasn't because of all their infighting, our homes wouldn't have become a Sarkaz backyard.
[name="Rockrock"]It's tiring enough trying to take back our homes... The Sarkaz want to fight on our lands, and not only is there nothing we can do about it, it has nothing to do with us.
[Character(name="avg_4040_rockr_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_402_1#4$1",focus=2)]

[name="Feist"]Maybe you think they're here to snatch the crown, but the way I see it, we have a common enemy.

[name="Rockrock"]I'm not so confident to think that we can take control of the situation. Not like you.
[name="Rockrock"]The Sarkaz... they're nothing like you think. They're that good at pretending.
[name="Rockrock"]The day my dad was executed, I spotted a girl in the distance... The executioner called her 'Your Majesty.'
[name="Rockrock"]That was when I found out what the king of the devils actually looked like.
[Character(name="avg_4040_rockr_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_402_1#3$1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_4040_rockr_1#9$1",name2="avg_npc_402_1#3$1",focus=1)]
[name="Rockrock"]Because I never saw the need to.
[Character(name="avg_4040_rockr_1#10$1",name2="avg_npc_402_1#3$1",focus=1)]
[name="Rockrock"]I'm telling you this now because... I want you to know we can't let ourselves be deceived by looks.

[name="Londinium Citizen?"]You have too many guests.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Manfred"]Ah, I forgot. You didn't want to see the Confessarius Messenger.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]If he found out that I came back to Londinium, wouldn't that spell the end of my leisurely days?
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Manfred"]Even then, you didn't have to wait for Hoederer to leave before you show yourself. He's my man. He won't ever report your presence to the court.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]Oh, he's your man? Don't fool yourself; you don't trust anyone.
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]If you really trusted him, you could've just hollered my name. You're the one who decided to wait till the Dublinn Feline and your mercenary friends were gone before saying hello.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Manfred"]......
[name="Manfred"]Let's set this topic aside. You helped me lure the Dublinn forces into position this morning. I owe you this one.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]Oh... It's no big deal. Besides, I got a little surprise out of it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Manfred"]A surprise...? For you, of all people, to use that word, I'm guessing you found more than a few rebels.
[name="Manfred"]Hm... Did you meet the Rhodes Islanders down there?
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]There's more. Not only did I run into them, they were the ones who 'rescued' me from Dublinn and escorted me to the city walls.
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]If it wasn't for how antsy you were to test your prized new toy, such that I had to be 'blown up' in front of them, perhaps I could've followed them a little longer.
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]I actually wanted to have a good chat with her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Manfred"]......
[name="Manfred"]What if I tell you there's still a chance?
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]Another job for me? Didn't you send the Dublinns and the mercenaries to guard the temporary brig? I thought you had everything in place already, and you just had to extend an invitation?
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Manfred"]I prefer writing myself a few insurance policies.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]Alright, alright. You owe us one, then.
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]Uh... Did I just say 'us?'
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Manfred"]No matter. There's no one else here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_416_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]Truth be told, we don't really want to stay here for much longer... That narcissistic old man with the chalice is almost here, isn't he?
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]Don't tell him about us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#7$1")]
[name="Manfred"]Of course... I have yet to repay your kindness, after all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_404_1#8$1")]
[name="Manfred"]Another note... You should stop masquerading as a dead man. Not only might you find your cover blown, it also... makes me feel uneasy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_416_1#1$1")]
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]Gah, we almost forgot. What an upstanding Sarkaz you are, right, pupil of Theresis?
[name="Londinium Citizen?"]Relax. The next time we meet, I won't be 'Mr. Thomas' anymore.
