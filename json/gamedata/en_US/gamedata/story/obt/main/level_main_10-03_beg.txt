[name="Hoederer"]......
[name="Hoederer"]Lively.
[name="Manfred"]How does it compare to the battlefields of Kazdel?
[name="Hoederer"]Nothing new.
[name="Hoederer"]But at least... it's not Sarkaz on both sides tearing each other apart.
[name="Manfred"]Surely you hunted, during your time in Kazdel.
[name="Hoederer"]You're asking if I've been hunting? Us mercs are out in the wilderness all year 'round. Hunting is how we get fed.
[name="Manfred"]Then, you should understand why I left these ports open.
[name="Hoederer"]Sometimes, even if your trap is obvious, a beast will step right into it because there's no other choice.
[name="Hoederer"]If it can't find a way out, it'll panic and run wild. That means we've got to expend energy and spread our forces thin to round up all the wild beasts.
[name="Manfred"]Sure. That's how things go in the wilds, but there's more to it.
[name="Manfred"]Look at the city below us. It is little more than a concrete wilderness.
[name="Manfred"]Who has the confidence to seal off every exit to the wilds themselves? Who can find every nook and cranny in a jungle? Who can secure every last potential hiding spot?
[name="Manfred"]I am certainly not so conceited.
[name="Hoederer"]So that's why you left a few openings. Focus your attention, and wait for the enemies to reveal themselves. That's a pretty efficient way of dealing with it.
[name="Manfred"]But it does come with one risk.
[name="Hoederer"]Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?
[name="Hoederer"]If I was in your position, I'd do the same thing.
[name="Manfred"]Good. If you're capable of leading mercenaries, you're capable of leading the hunt.
[name="Manfred"]That's why I'd rather fight alongside you than the relics in the Court.
[name="Hoederer"]And by the looks of things, you'll be feasting tonight.
[name="Hoederer"]Not just the rebels, but Dublinn as well...
[name="Hoederer"]Wait, I've seen that caster before. She came to see you once. Didn't you sign a truce? Not that either of you took it particularly seriously.
[name="Manfred"]If you recognize her, then you should also know that people like her don't know when to stop.
[name="Hoederer"]You've been wanting to eliminate that variable for a while now, huh?
[name="Manfred"]The situation has changed. His Majesty's opus is reaching its conclusion. If the theatre is too rowdy, it is too easy to overlook an actual threat.
[name="Manfred"]We need to keep a closer eye on the dukes out there.
[name="Hoederer"]Couldn't you just send me to do that?
[name="Manfred"]If I wanted her dead, I wouldn't even need you.
[name="Hoederer"]What's the problem then?
[name="Manfred"]'The Iron Guard of Wellington.'
[name="Hoederer"]You mean...
[name="Manfred"]He hasn't made a move on Londinium yet.
[name="Manfred"]And if he's quiet for even a single day, all the nobles outside Londinium ask their emissaries, first thing in the morning, whether the Iron Duke has spoken.
[name="Hoederer"]Okay.
[name="Manfred"]Which is why we haven't made an enemy of Dublinn, so far.
[name="Manfred"]Now though, since she's the one who lost control and took the first step toward violating our agreement––
[name="Manfred"]The Sarkaz have no more reason to continue tolerating them.
[name="Hoederer"]So the commotion down there is just the beginning.
[name="Manfred"]Yes. We still need something... more decisive, to take Dublinn out of the picture.
