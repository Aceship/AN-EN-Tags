[name="???"]What these shadows tell of is the second Kazdel that could be called a city.
[name="???"]After the very first Kazdel was laid to waste by the Elders and Ancients, there passed over a thousand years where Kazdel was no more than a tiny hamlet, a mass of thatch and wooden fencing.
[name="???"]Frail, easily destroyed, it was ravaged by the wills of colonizers again and again, and again and again the Sarkaz were sent into exile.
[name="???"]Until this moment, where the Sarkaz had once again accumulated strength, once again rebuilt... a true city.
[name="???"]They left the wastes that we now call Columbia, and came to the heartlands of Terra, and there they lived, and there they died.
[name="???"]And then... a betrayal. Another migration east. And before they'd gone far, the blue flames of fury were again betrayed.
[name="???"]It seems as if Sarkaz history were cursed from that moment on.
