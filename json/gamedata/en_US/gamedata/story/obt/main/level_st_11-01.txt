Palace of Westhaleg, Londinium
[Dialog]
[delay(time=1)]
Even before Londinium was a nomadic city, the Palace of Westhaleg stood here.
Its name was originally plain Westhaleg. The Draco royal family convened its ministers here in this palace, and used their beloved gold and ruby to decorate the outer walls.
Said decorations went up in flames during the Great Fire three hundred years ago. Still, the building's skeleton remained, and it bore witness to the first Aslan king's coronation.
Thereafter, Westhaleg formally became the Palace of Westhaleg, to commemorate the age of peace and prosperity founded by the Draco and Aslan kings in joint.
Twenty-six years ago, the last Aslan king was captured in the same place by Parliament's standing forces.
And now, this is no longer the building where the Victorian Parliament assembles.
Sat at the conference table is but one person, not Draco, nor Aslan, but Sarkaz.

[name="Theresis"]I saw us still in Londinium, yet unarmed.
[name="Theresis"]Clouds enveloping this city, black stones growing everywhere, and the Sarkaz... the Sarkaz there in the way, between Catastrophe and the crowd.
[name="Theresis"]Once the disaster lifted, Londinium's city gates were wide open to us, and the Victorians stood flanking the streets, cheering and welcoming us in.
[name="Theresis"]We entered this palace, and the one sat on the throne no longer feared the black stones that grew from us, and took our hands.
[name="Theresis"]He called the Sarkaz—
[name="Theresis"]'Friends.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=2)]
[name="Theresa"]It sounds unfathomable.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]
[name="Theresis"]There was more.
[name="Theresis"]I saw Vampire, Nachzehrer and Wendigo set foot together into reaches more northern than even Ursus, casting fragments of strange monsters back unto the frigid sky.
[name="Theresis"]And I saw Banshee and Damazti venture to parts more southern than even Iberia, walls against the ocean's dissent within the boundless water.
[name="Theresis"]Countless Sarkaz giving their lives for this land—
[name="Theresis"]And Aslan, Draco, Feline, Caprinae, Liberi... stood together with them.

[name="Theresa"]This dream...
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=2)]
[name="Theresa"]I remember.
[name="Theresa"]But you told me, then, that my ideals were too distant, that it was not only our enemies who could never comprehend me, but neither could the Sarkaz.
[name="Theresa"]A myriad years of grievances became our weapons one and all, and all imposed upon me.
[name="Theresa"]You also told me that the flames of war within the Sarkaz would tear them apart before I led them to that future, that was more likely in all respects.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]
[name="Theresis"]But you begrudge giving up any possibility, even if it may be but a nascent spark.

[name="Theresa"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]
[name="Theresis"]You've also said...
[name="Theresis"]That this world once was only the Sarkaz's. That the Ancients and Elders wrested our homeland from our forebears' hands.
[name="Theresis"]Their souls in death still murmur the Sankta's betrayal, how the Royal Court withers like autumn leaves, how our bloodline is lost in howls of grief, how ridiculous the sinners are in forgetting history, and how Kazdel's ruins strew all across Terra.
[name="Theresis"]And then, they—cry out—
[name="Theresis"]—'The Sarkaz have invaded our homeland.'

[name="Theresa"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]
[name="Theresis"]So better that the Sarkaz believe in the fight. The fight can herd our destinies together as one. Better that than...
[name="Theresis"]...Peace.
[name="Theresis"]This isn't fair. To rule is a method of coexistence too.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=2)]
[name="Theresa"]Terra will perish by its own hand before it confronts those time-old questions.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]
[name="Theresis"]But our homeland would be more magnificent than the many of the Seaborn. Our hexcrafters would hold the northern menace at bay. Our knowledge, all-encompassing, would dispel Originium, end the Catastrophes...
[name="Theresis"]Before all that, the Sarkaz must reach an answer.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=2)]
[name="Theresa"]You're right... they must.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]
[name="Theresis"]This is a conversation we've had countless times, but now, you can hear their voices clearly. You can make real contact with their ancient souls' tendrils. So tell me, Theresa—
[name="Theresis"]—Did this myriad of years of all the Teekaz souls that lived and breathed, and passed from life to the other shore in death—did they ever receive a momentary respite?
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=2)]
[name="Theresa"]......
[name="Theresa"]I've already failed, Theresis.

[name="Theresis"]Because you're a move behind.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=2)]
[name="Theresa"]Because at this moment, it is we that stand here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]
[name="Theresis"]Here...
[name="Theresis"]Londinium.
[name="Theresis"]Tell me, Theresa.
[name="Theresis"]When you stand atop The Shard and look at this city, what is it you see?
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=2)]
[name="Theresa"]That Victoria is a nation lush with ingenuity.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]
[name="Theresis"]Without a doubt. In a few short centuries, they've built nomadic cities, withstood Catastrophe, even attempted to control the storm—
[name="Theresis"]Not to mention those knights of white steam. The valiance of those steel suits of armor that ventured into Kazdel, two hundred years ago, falls far short of that which I saw in the years to follow.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=2)]
[name="Theresa"]Ah... perhaps it's the fault of our unique blood, for granting so many of us lives far too long.
[name="Theresa"]So long that in the intervals between one war and the next, we lift our heads, only to realize that, excepting the Sarkaz, everyone is progressing on.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]
[name="Theresis"]No, it's nothing to do with the length of an individual's life.
[name="Theresis"]They have the opportunity to progress, simply because in the past they monopolized the freedom to choose between peace and war.
[name="Theresis"]Theresa, when I look at Londinium, I see the number of times this nation has gone wrong.
[name="Theresis"]The Victorians scorn how primitive the Sarkaz are, yet in essence they simply use the rules of the culture they founded to gild the greed and violence that runs in their deepest marrow.
[name="Theresis"]They tear at each other, incessantly. Ultimately, everything they've made will be ruined by their own hands.
[name="Theresis"]<i>That</i> is why we could win this chance at freedom.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=2)]
[name="Theresa"]Even if hope is still as remote?
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=1)]
[name="Theresis"]—
[name="Theresis"]I won't give up on any possibility.
[Character(name="avg_npc_062",name2="avg_npc_056",focus=2)]
[name="Theresa"]Yes... in that regard, we've always been so alike.

[name="Clovisia"]It'd be pointless to try and win backing from a treasonist. If we plan to raid their command tower, we need some other way to seize system privileges.
[name="Clovisia"]Of course... method aside, there's the fact that our troops desperately need new armaments... The Sarkaz have placed their sights back on the city interior, and our supplies are stretched thin.

[name="Allerdale"]Clovisia, Rhodes Island has brought Artorius's relic back to Londinium.

[Character(name="avg_npc_397_1#1$1")]
[name="Allerdale"]Exactly. I've already checked with the Doctor and Amiya. It's the Artorius key, without a doubt.
[Character(name="avg_npc_397_1#6$1")]
[name="Allerdale"]And that key... opens the way to the door of the Mausoleum of Kings. Which means we can retrieve the empire's blade, the 'Sighs of Kings.'

[name="Allerdale"]Its significance goes beyond what any ordinary citizen would ever imagine. Trust me, please.
[name="Allerdale"]It's not just some pretty piece of steel bestowed with symbolism. If we say The Shard is Londinium's great, incomplete ambition...
[name="Allerdale"]Then the truth of the Victorian Realmblade and the Mausoleum of Kings—that would be Londinium's real ace in the sleeve.

[name="Clovisia"]I believe you. The Mausoleum of Kings is practically a thing of myth to us, but if a royal key can open the door to it...
[name="Clovisia"]Amiya, how exactly did Rhodes Island even get this key...? Er, should I not have asked?

[name="Amiya"]We won't conceal the key's history.
[name="Amiya"]But it isn't Rhodes Island's. It bears tales upon tales that I was never a part of, and could never tell you.
[name="Amiya"]For Rhodes Island's time with it, though, I can tell you bit by bit if you're interested.
[Character(name="avg_npc_394_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_401_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Clovisia"]Thank you, Amiya.
[name="Clovisia"]I'm just... floored, really. The legacy of Artorius... the truth of The Shard...
[name="Clovisia"]It's as if—Rhodes Island really has been preparing, for all these years now, to be here today in Londinium.
[name="Clovisia"]But I won't delve any further for now. I won't make anyone else, either. It might lose us an important ally.

[name="Allerdale"]Indeed. But like I told you, Londinium's a massive city. They don't have enough people, they're all on their own, and that serves us opportunities.

[name="Allerdale"]Her Highness gave me a simple synopsis of Rhodes Island. You seem to be all sorts of bound up with the Sarkaz.
[name="Allerdale"]But according to what I've heard, Rhodes Island has, and has always, worked for the sake of the 'Infected.'
