[name="Amiya"]Miss, give me your hand, and I'll draw it out for you!
[charslot]
The tiny Cautus gently takes the hand of the Infected patient lying on the sickbed into her own—Black crystals cover her entire body, an enchanting Originite sheen circulating inside the crystals.
Amiya knows what this means for an Infected. She has seen it before.
Her finger earnestly traces a shape on the patient's palm.

[name="Amiya"]Then I'll wait for you to come back.
[charslot]
The Infected patient says nothing, and only rubs Amiya's head.
Amiya sees the patient trying her best to bear the pain, and the shiny Originium crystals on her arm.

[charslot]
Amiya, you had just followed the Doctor to Babel then.
I still remember you sat at the door of the quarantine cabin for a long time, persistently refusing to move.
The Doctor found you in silence, and sat down to join you. You only started crying when the Doctor hugged you.
I too, wanted to hold you in my arms, but I couldn't bear to disturb you both.
Amiya... you're a bright child. You knew that Infected would never return.
She didn't want you to see her leave. It would be too cruel for a child to witness. But she didn't know just how strong you are.
I see many things from your gentle eyes. You want to help them...
No matter their race or Infection status—you see them all as lively, lovely people.
It was from that moment I began to harbor a selfish idea—
Perhaps... you could bear this crown in the future...
Perhaps... you can go further than I have.
I was in no hurry to hand over a responsibility this heavy to you. I thought I had the luxury of time to be by your side as you grew up—
I'm sorry, Amiya. I broke my promise.

Pink-white threads fork out like branches, attaching and growing on the white pillars.

[charslot]
Amiya walks to the silk-wrapped roots, gently touching the soft matter.
Sparks of flame drop from the hem of her skirt, leaving clusters of fire in her path.
The flames under her do not extinguish easily, but spread to the threads.
They continue to climb, replacing the fractured white threads as they wrap around the only tower standing between land and sky.
[dialog]
[Background(image="50_g19_babeltop_ex2",fadetime=3,screenadapt="coverall", block=true)]
Threads flutter and fall to the floor.
They quickly cover the roots, like a garden in bloom by wind, with flames burning within.
Theresa sits among the flower-like flames, leaning on the roots as she looks at the golden ocean in the 'sky' coming to a calm.

[name="Logos"]Your Highness, will the myriad souls still exist after today?
[name="Theresa"]No.
[name="Logos"]Will there be ferrymen with an array on torches lighting up the other side?
[name="Theresa"]No more.
[name="Logos"]Then where will our kin go, when they leave us?
[name="Theresa"]I don't know... I'm afraid it's too late for me to find that answer.
[name="Theresa"]I've walked to the end, and the truth of civilization lies before me in fog. There is no way for me to touch it, but it does not mean the rest of you cannot cross it.
[name="Logos"]Your Highness...?
[name="Theresa"]*chuckle* I've just unloaded the burden of worrying for the future. What the myriad souls care about is only the Sarkaz.
[name="Theresa"]'From death comes new life'... you understand the inevitability of fate, but you have yet to clearly perceive the truth of death.
[name="Theresa"]The myriad souls are no longer our shackles, and Originium will no longer be the sin we bear.
[name="Theresa"]Logos, our departure also serves as our liberation.
[name="Theresa"]No longer will there be prolonged indignant murmuring for a myriad years, nor an unforgettable legacy of suffering to be inherited.
[name="Theresa"]For the first time we have a future that can be changed.

That day, a certain exhausted Sarkaz girl fell into a deep sleep within the warm flames of the Kazdel Soul Furnace for some reason.
She dreamed of her mother far away in a foreign country, standing in light within the pitch-black darkness speaking to her.
She couldn't hear her clearly, but she did not cry either. Because she saw her mother smile. Then, she woke up, opened her eyes, and saw a pure white flower in full bloom by her head.
The black dust from the forge burning death landed on the fragile flower petals, but it unexpectedly highlighted the flower's dazzling vitality even more instead. 
Here, death and light congregate. The girl shed tears at the beauty created by setting death aflame.
After that day, Sarkaz passing by the Soul Furnace would see a girl show up every single day to water a flower growing in the Originium dust and bones with drops of dew.
She offered tribute to the light until the day that flower withered and died.
