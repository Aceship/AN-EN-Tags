This gutless man suddenly pulls out something and brandishes it in the air. It's a fountain pen, and even in the dark, you can tell clearly just how fancy it's decorated.
He's a scholar of heraldry, claims he could be the next Fellow of the Royal Victorian Academy of Science. Maybe that's the pen from which all sorts of marvelous criticisms used to flow.
But now, it's just a pathetic, utterly shameful weapon, clutched in a trembling hand.

The man trembles and shakes harder and harder, until finally his legs give out and he's kneeling on the floor. He's probably never begged someone like this in all his life. He's acting a comedic sight.
He grips his overcoat with white knuckles, so tight the place where he hides the can bulges out. It's like a weeping tumor parasiting off his body. Or an unborn child more loved than it'd ever know.

[name="'Sargonian'"]I once became as a lord ameer's countenance, and met the King of Kings of that era. He proclaimed himself 'The Shah of Past and Future,' that all answers to all creation lay in his golden trove of treasures.
[name="'Sargonian'"]I asked him: Your Majesty, what meaning is there to all we surround ourselves with? Where will you lead us?
[name="'Sargonian'"]He lifted his head high, and proclaimed to me: My very thought is Meaning.
[name="'Sargonian'"]Such was his arrogance, his egotism, that basking in the light of the afternoon sun, he believed himself Civilization's ruler.
[name="'Sargonian'"]But all I could see was that, comically, he'd trodden on a corner of his own cloak.
[name="'Sargonian'"]I was bored. And so I departed the place.
