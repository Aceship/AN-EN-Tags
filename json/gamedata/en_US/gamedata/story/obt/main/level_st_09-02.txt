She didn't give me a choice.
This child isn't the first of our fellows I've killed. How young was I then? She had me burn the Victorian merchant who wouldn't sell us bread, to death.

[name="Harmonie"]  Alright, alright, you think I don't know you? You were one of the first to start following The Leader. You ought to set your sights a bit farther some. But one single Hillock, and you're in this frenzy of a state. You don't even think it's embarrassing.

In the ruins of the village, I found a piece of paper.
It was fragile, very much so, all four corners charred black, and as I picked it up, half fell to ash, and sadly, only half of the words were left upon it.
'Why should I lose heart'
'A great flame may have burned the whole land to its end'
'But I see someone's soul, on the other side of the scales'
It was a poem, a verse missing its beginning.
These words seemed freshly written, the ink still not naturally set, before fire scorched it dry.
Yes. My fire.
My soul...
