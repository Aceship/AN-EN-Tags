[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  But Mr. Scout said they didn’t die for any one person. They died for an idea.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  His team did, and so did mine.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  So I decided to look into Reunion. I had to see where things were going, and how I could help Rhodes Island.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  —I saw the guerrillas had their own idea. A firm, pure conviction that they were fighting for.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  They were a little more savage, of course, but they never found joy in violence. That’s what I saw in them.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  If Reunion was supposed to be about liberating the Infected, then the guerrillas... they were there to exterminate their oppressors.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  They’d exterminate those who enslave the Infected, and those who threaten the common folk. All of them. To a man.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  That’s because of Patriot. Patriot taught them, led them, and protected them.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Before Patriot set out from Chernobog on a mission, I had a... talk with him.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  *Sigh*. Just how old is that warrior? But he still shared some of his booze with me. It was the first time... anybody treated me like that.

[Character(name="avg_npc_059")]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  The truth is, there aren’t many of those soldiers he led out of Ursus left.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Their clashes with the Ursus regulars must’ve cost them a lot of men.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Most of his guerrillas are fresh recruits, people who volunteered to join when they fought in the northwest tundra.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Their battles, their prestige, and their ideals all won them recruits.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  They used to work well with the leader of Reunion. But for some reason, maybe related to the burning hate the Infected have for the people of Ursus... things turned out like this.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  It is what it is. Everyone alive today suffers Catastrophes, madness, and death. All kinds of suffering that this world heaps upon them.

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="avg_npc_059",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Oh yes.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Regarding your pay, I’m afraid your work here doesn’t support a salary. Sorry.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Also, Guard, please do tell me—
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If Patriot betrays Talulah, what happens then?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="avg_npc_059",focus=2)]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  ...That won’t happen. Patriot trusts Talulah deeply. 
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="avg_npc_059",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Now what about the other way around?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="avg_npc_059",focus=2)]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  ...Dr. Kal'tsit?!
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="avg_npc_059",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  What if Talulah betrays Patriot?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Or, what if I told you we encountered the Reunion commander, FrostNova, and by any objective measure, are responsible for her death?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="avg_npc_059",focus=2)]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Dr. Kal’tsit?! What are you saying?!
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  That... th-that’s Patriot’s daughter...!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4",name2="avg_npc_059",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  If we fight Patriot...
[name="Amiya"]  That would be the worst case scenario. And it’s what the puppetmasters would want.
[name="Amiya"]  If Talulah really is turning a blind eye to, or even allowing the Infected to harm innocent civilians in spite of Patriot’s stance... I believe that’s no longer just turning a blind eye.
[name="Amiya"]  A lot of Infected will make Patriot into a target. Those who don’t know the truth, and those who let their hatred get the better of them.
[name="Amiya"]  And those who want to.

[name="Amiya"]  Whether Misha or FrostNova...
[name="Amiya"]  Us, Reunion, and Lungmen too... We can’t let anyone else slip through the cracks.
[name="Amiya"]  Doctor, we still have a lot to do... just thinking of what comes next is making me tired.
[name="Amiya"]  But before that... we have to find Madame Ch'en.
[name="Amiya"]  And, most importantly...
[name="Amiya"]  The leader of Reunion. She’s the cause of all of this.

[name="Elysium"]  The captain has determined Reunion’s communication method. It’s primitive, even artificial-looking. As for personnel, she’s just about done clearing the area.
[name="Elysium"]  Not the guerrillas though. They’re tough.
[name="Elysium"]  Should we eliminate them?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  No need for that. We’re not here to eliminate them, or have them butcher each other.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We’re not here to stir up internal conflict. They should oppose those who misled them.
[Character]
[name="Elysium"]  Now?
[name="Elysium"]  That’s her question. I’m good.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Naturally... not now.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Their spirit is rotten, but their fabrication of a backbone still remains.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Take it away or break it, and watch them crumble. That’s what we might have done at first.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Talulah was a step ahead of us. She stirred the conflict and fanned its flames.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I originally thought that she had gone mad. But this is poison, not madness.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Because what we do next can hardly be called an infiltration, Dr. {@nickname}. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  As I said when we started, infiltration is only about twenty percent of our plan here.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  To get to the core command tower and the generator area to halt Chernobog’s movement, we will have to go through the central district.

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Let’s put W aside for now.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  As a tactician, you should be more concerned about this than about Talulah, Reunion’s tyrant.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Infected Guerrillas of the Northern Plains, a thorn in the hinterland of Ursus’s Fourth Army to the northwest... Since its formation, it has only ever had one leader.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Ordinary resistance fighters get slaughtered, but these guerrillas were able to turn the tables on the butchers.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Local stakeholders could request the mobilization of a division or two to knock them out, but it would be taken as an admission of incompetence to the generals and the State Council.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The war raged for so long that the Infected hiding out in the snow came to call the guerrillas their “Aegis.”
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Aegis of the Infected.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Yeti Squad was one of its subsets, and its members did not solely consist of Infected.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The exiles, the fanatics, the maimed, Elves, Durin, and Sarkaz. The guerrillas did not fight for the Infected alone.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Would you rather I didn’t?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You want me to reprimand you, Dr. {@nickname}?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Not now. I don’t think you do, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with what you said.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  In an unexpectedly apt analogy, the guerrilla fighters also trust only one commander, and embrace only that one commander.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Yes, Doctor, this guerrilla force is another sort of “Rhodes Island.”
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But their leader? No.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Dr. {@nickname}, prepare yourself well. Or you’ll regret it.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Even though one of our objectives is to clear a path through the central district to the bridge and the generator area...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  For your own safety, I still hope you and Amiya will not face him.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But if this is all inevitable, then I can only repeat what I just said.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...Prepare yourself well, Dr. {@nickname}. And before you face him, you must prepare to face his guerrillas.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I rarely offer my advice to others, Doctor.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But that is “Patriot,” Buldrokkas'tee.
