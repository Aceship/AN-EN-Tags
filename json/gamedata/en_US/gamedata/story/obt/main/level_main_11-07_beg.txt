Feist thought he was getting a talking to.
He was ready, thinking about what he could say to move the heart of the stubborn old worker before him.
Catherine has seen too much. Her temper is harder than the machines in the factory.
His cleverness with words has never been of any use before Catherine. Her fierce gaze sees through all, turning his wits to mush.
Feist feels a familiar sense of helplessness.
He always turns back into a little boy before his grandmother. Clumsy, excitable, prone to saying something he instantly regrets. He can only wait for his grandmother to speak first.
But Catherine says nothing.
She leads Feist down a long path. When they finally stop, he glances at her expression, and surprisingly sees no hint of anger.
