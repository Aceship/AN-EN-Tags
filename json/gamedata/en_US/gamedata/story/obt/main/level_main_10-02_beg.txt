[name="Amiya"] Doctor, do you still remember the table-top exercise we did with Dr. Kal'tsit before we left?
[Character(name="avg_npc_394_1#2$1")]
[name="Amiya"] One possibility is that the Messengers we had active around Londinium and Victoria all failed.
[Character(name="avg_npc_394_1#2$1")]
[name="Amiya"] They didn't have time to provide us with the accurate intel, and Theresis was able to see all our moves.
[Character(name="avg_npc_394_1#18$1")]
[name="Amiya"] In that case, Theresis's personal guard would be there waiting for us the moment we set foot in Londinium.
