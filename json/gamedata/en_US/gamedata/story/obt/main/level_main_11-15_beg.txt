[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]Cautus, you are not worthy of the crown that Theresa bestowed upon you.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]Not because you are not Sarkaz, but because you have never tried to understand the nature of the Sarkaz.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]Like Theresa, you have been blinded by the creature that calls itself Kal'tsit.
[name="Sanguinarch of Vampires"]You thought the Sarkaz a race linked by blood, like the Felines.

A Sarkaz scales the city walls.
Behind him, a city of gray iron. Above his head, a black banner.
Wounded warriors line up before him. Young Sarkaz, about his age but untrained, guard the city walls with rusty swords in their hands.
Countless compatriots stand behind him, some old, some young, many with nothing more than bows and arrows for hunting.
The enemy has tread the barrens and come before their city.
They hear the staves of the Spire Casters cut through air.
They hear the Gaulish gunners directing their Originium guns.
They hear the heavy footsteps of steam armor, and the gushing of steam as they charge.

They hear the wind blowing the commander's robes, and the cold and dull sound it makes when it hits armor.
Who is the Feline? Steam Knights stand before her. Is she a Victorian general? But the Spire casters and Gaulish gunners obey her call.
They hear her pass judgment upon the Sarkaz.
'I know all that the Sarkaz are planning. Hatred is a sickness that cannot be cured. Your vengeance will bring wounds to the land that can never be healed.'
'Ambition must be culled while in the bud, for the peace of the world for the next two hundred years.'
Fire rushes towards Kazdel from all directions. Another Kazdel is reduced to ruin. Countless Sarkaz die in the conflagration, but a worse fate awaits those who survive it.
Why did I have to die?
Because our origin was different? Must we be eradicated, simply because the land could not stand our hatred anymore?
Six heroes rise from the ruins. They charge the great army before them, carrying the burning banner of Kazdel.
No Sarkaz dies willingly. The screams of the tens of thousands of Sarkaz who fell become war drums for the heroes as they charge the enemy.

A silhouette.
A Sarkaz, watching you silently.
He lacks the thick malice of the Vampire, the proud contempt of the Confessarius, or the fearsome aura of the Nachzehrer. He even lacks the Wendigo's imposing stature.
Just one Sarkaz, no army, no servants. He rose from his throne, laid down the authority that he never truly cared for, and walked here.
With a cold gaze not seen for two centuries.
