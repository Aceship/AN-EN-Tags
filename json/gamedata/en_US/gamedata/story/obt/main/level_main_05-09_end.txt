[name="Ch'en"]  (I even made sure to prepare for ranged attacks, but how does he pack this much firepower…?)
[name="Ch'en"]  That's not enough to save your life. You'll die before your sniper can land a shot on me.

[name="Mephisto"]  He missed that shot on purpose, dear Madam. We'll spare your life this once, so take this as a gesture of kindness.
[name="Mephisto"]  Right now, the seeds of unrest have been sown within the L.G.D.
[name="Mephisto"]  It was your organization's corruption and negligence that gave him the chance to cooperate with us.

[name="Ch'en"]  But even those four were set up by me. After they got in contact with you, did you lock one of them up?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1",focus=2)]

[name="Mephisto"]  Of course I've figured it out. My squad has been crushed, and I'm the only one left.
[name="Mephisto"]  Our forces wandering around outside are hopelessly weak, and my comrades have basically lost their will to fight.
