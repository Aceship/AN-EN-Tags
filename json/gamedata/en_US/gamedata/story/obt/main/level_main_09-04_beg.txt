MacMartin Brothers' Chip, first floor
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]Still no reply?
[Character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Chef MacMartin"]None. Haven't gotten a peep from Londinium, yesterday or today.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]It's been twenty hours. They have to have received my last telecoms by now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]Could the encrypted line be faulty?
[Character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Chef MacMartin"]Hard to say, sir. Being honest, it's been nearly ten years since I graduated, transferred to Hillock. There's not much information you need to activate this secret comms line.
[Character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Chef MacMartin"]Two years back, around the end, I reported to our group's boss, and he asked me if I had anything to say other than whatever number kid was being born. And that if I hadn't, I could save even giving the routine reports.
[Character(name="avg_222_bpipe_1#1")]
[name="Bagpipe"]Oh, no wonder you opened this chippy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Chef MacMartin"]Not a bad plan, right? Codename's not Chef for fun. Thought at the time, suppose some outsider wanted to sniff out our liaison point, they'd only suspect next door's bookshop.
[Character(name="avg_222_bpipe_1#1")]
[name="Bagpipe"]Aye, right. Besides, your chips are delicious too!
[Character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Chef MacMartin"]Ought to be, eh? Hahah, you fill yourselves up.
[name="Chef MacMartin"]Hillock's potatoes are high quality. Locals all love my chips—if I didn't still remember my actual job as a lamplighter, I would've opened up branches ages ago. Five, six of them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Chef MacMartin"]Ah, anyhow, I thought I was dreaming of the time I was in training again, when you gave the secret knock at the door yesterday.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#2")]
[name="Horn"]...It seems highly likely this line was abandoned long ago.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#2")]
[name="Horn"]Or perhaps, someone's received our info, but doesn't want to reply.
[Character(name="avg_222_bpipe_1#2")]
[name="Bagpipe"]You mean there's people interceptin' our intel on purpose, Leader?
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]Not easy to say yet.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]We'll send the next report as we would originally—right, and besides Triangle's findings, add on the outcome of my dialogue with Colonel Hamilton.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]The Colonel's targeted measures against a portion of the residents are already extremely suspicious. In the worst case, I'd like for our team to be allowed more flexibility.
[Character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Chef MacMartin"]That... sounds like there's no point in me convincing you to use a barracks Messenger, is there?
[Character(name="avg_222_bpipe_1#4")]
[name="Bagpipe"]Ugh. Leader, I don't wanna say this, but we're a little low on numbers.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]That definitely isn't like you to say. Relax, though. Nobody wants to take that step.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]But... the circumstances about this city are far more complicated than any of us foresaw.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]Chef, seeing as you've been in County Hillock for so long, how do you feel about the people here?
[Character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Chef MacMartin"]Nothing unusual to me. If you put a Taran in front of me right now, I wouldn't fancy them much different from a Victorian anywhere else.
[Character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Chef MacMartin"]To tell the honest truth, if life's not bad, who'd want to make trouble all the livelong day?
[Character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Chef MacMartin"]Quite a few wear ideals on their sleeves, but only a minority ever take them to heart. Most just care about filling their stomachs, and if they're full, they can care about the purse, too.
[Character(name="avg_222_bpipe_1#1")]
[name="Bagpipe"]Right you are! I can barely imagine Damian Barry caught up in the spectre force either.
[Character(name="avg_222_bpipe_1#5")]
[name="Bagpipe"]In my eyes, him and the locals were all normal people, scared stiff beggin' for forgiveness the moment they're arrested, comin' together when a loved one dies just so they could fall to pieces and weep.
[Character(name="avg_222_bpipe_1#7")]
[name="Bagpipe"]They're nothin' like trained soldiers at all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]What you're saying is exactly what I'm worrying about—Colonel Hamilton might have been spouting more than just alarmist talk.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]When ordinary people take up weapons, voluntarily or not, the disaster we then face will be the likes of which Victoria hasn't seen for a very long time.

[Character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_213",focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_213",focus=2)]
[name="Saoirse"]It's not your fault. And I don't think it's mine. I just want to live life peaceful. I don't want to see any more people I care about die.
[Character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#9$1",name2="avg_npc_213",focus=1)]
[name="Janie"]Cry it out, Saoirse... I'm here with you. Seeing a loved one pass on and still having to manage your work, it's too much pressure on you. Here, lean on my shoulder? It'll be more comfortable.

[Character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_213",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_479_sleach_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_213",focus=2)]
[name="Saoirse"]This address should be enough. You can... hand it to someone you think's reliable. Your Sergeant Major, or maybe another officer, like Uncle Louis.
[name="Saoirse"]I know there's people around asking about Damian. They want to be clear what it is we're plotting.

[name="Operator Shredder"]You can speak Taran?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#6",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]Considering your backgrounds, that's reasonable.
[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]Oliver grew up in a middle-class household in north Londinium, with family roots in Gaul. He lives upstairs from the office these days, taking some time off every year to go back and see his wife and children.
[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]Fred's more or less an apprentice from County Peninsula. He's got bunch of brothers and one little sister, and the whole family gets along like a dream.
[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]Will's a local. His clan moved decades ago from a fixed village nearby, and his Taran blood's probably from his paternal grandmother.

[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]Language.
[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]Name, pronunciation, wording, tone, and even where you pause—language tells a keen ear more than you could ever guess.

[name="Operator Shredder"]I heard about how Sankta extraordinary are, but I never figured...

[name="Outcast"]Ahah. Really, it's just a hobby of mine.
[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]Anyhow, language itself holds a special significance to some folks. Why else would the Tarans have cared so much about digging a sample of their own language out of a pile of old books?
[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Operator Shredder"]You're not wrong. Half a decade ago, barely any Tarans regularly spoke it.

[name="Operator Shredder"]Until you mentioned it... I never noticed.
[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]Language binds a people together tighter than most things. A language doesn't get diluted over time like bloodlines do, and it doesn't get weighed on the scales of cost-benefit analysis like everything else.

[name="Operator Shredder"]Seven.
[Character(name="avg_npc_089",name2="avg_npc_245_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Outcast"]That's three on top of last month's report. In modern Victoria, when any wind stirs the grass, it's the big merchants' wallets that feel it first.
