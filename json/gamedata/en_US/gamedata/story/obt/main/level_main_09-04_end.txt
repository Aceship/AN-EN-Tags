[name="Bard Williams"]Of course, fine Lady, it would be my honor.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Wildly Ambitious Baron"]Seamus, my dearest great bard! Here you were.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Wildly Ambitious Baron"]I just finished reading your newly published tales from history. Such fascinating writings. It was the first I learned that us Tarans had such a grand, storied past.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]Thank you, but they're works of fantasy, adapted from an array of folk legends. The greatest value in my work is simply unearthing gems buried by sandstorms, all the better for more to see.
[Character(name="avg_npc_175")]
[name="Pretentious Noblewoman"]You truly are too modest. The Draco King Gaeil you penned, founding by himself the most radiant culture that was Tara—he stood grand and wise, so much so that my dreams are flush with emotion and he's part of them all—
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Wildly Ambitious Baron"]Yes, too true. In my eyes, you're alike to Leithanien's grand musicians, with the chance to make change to an entire era!
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]Ha, ha... I must say you exaggerate.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Wildly Ambitious Baron"]So long as you wanted, all of Victoria's publishers would be wide open to you, every one of them waiting to translate your works into the ink of different languages.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_175")]
[name="Pretentious Noblewoman"]If only things could be so wonderful. If more and more international figures come to support us, our voices will be so much more easily heard by the dukedom and Parliament.
[Character(name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Greedy Businessman"]Right you are! I'm a Victorian citizen same as anyone else, but just because some great-great-great-grandfather of mine was King Gaeil's subject, suddenly I'm being asked to pay so much more inheritance tax! How preposterous!
[Character(name="avg_npc_175")]
[name="Pretentious Noblewoman"]Even so, Mr. Evans, you still give vigorous employ to plenty enough of our fellows, providing everyone the chance to gain their footing upon this city of grace.
[name="Pretentious Noblewoman"]No wonder you and your clan are the pride of us Tarans.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Wildly Ambitious Baron"]Ahah, quite right, our fellows. It's far from easy for them to find any respectable work. I hear they toil in the factories for a week, and only earn yea little coin.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]Yet Victorian workers from other backgrounds are able to earn twice as much, in your factories.
[Character(name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Greedy Businessman"]Eh-hem...
[Character(name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Greedy Businessman"]Allow me to say something perhaps a little out of fashion—it's far from simple to have our neighbors of strength acknowledge us, isn't it?
[name="Greedy Businessman"]Please, think about it, everyone. Were it only with its music and poems, how could Leithanien become the Leithanien of today?
[Character(name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Greedy Businessman"]Just as Leithanien has Casters that intimidate—
[name="Greedy Businessman"]We Tarans must depend on more practical power if we want to gain recognition. Such as the... technological support of some friends from far away.
[Character(name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Greedy Businessman"]And by pure luck, I have just the tiniest means by which I receive sponsorship, and I would be overjoyed to take the opportunity to let the friends of the Baron share in it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Wildly Ambitious Baron"]Hahah, you're absolutely spot-on! Any subsidy is of great importance. If you let it all pass you by, then no matter how deft your tongue, you watch for the day it dries up and lacks the power to express.
[Character(name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Greedy Businessman"]From that perspective, I'm the same as everyone here. We are all yearning for a whole new era—so, why not give a toast to this common dream of ours?

[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]I'll be fine. Standing in the window breeze is plenty enough for me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]Then we'll continue our merry chat. What were we just saying?
[name="Bard Williams"]Right, yes. Words and writing were born for the purpose of exchange, including both conversations past and future, and this talk between you and I, here and now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]You're the one allowing for me. If you used Taran, I'd be as good as deaf.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]Ha-ha—in this party, you'll be hard-pressed to hear any Taran.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]It just clicked for me, actually. All the works of yours I've read are written in Victorian.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]Rhyming confines a poet's imagination. Characteristically, Victoria's poems, when you read them, are very unlike Leithanien's.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]I much love reading poems written in Old Taran. Reading the writing is like touching upon, feeling another face of history.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]But I've no plans to pass myself off as anything.
[name="Bard Williams"]I grew up speaking Victorian, my thoughts are molded by the language, and if I started to write in Taran instead, I'd be a clown dancing in shoes far too big for him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]I hear there are many longing for the revival of Taran culture—
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]Of course, I'm one of them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]Our city roams upon the land, this soil unchanging, yet at the same time, change constantly happening.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]Perhaps a day will come when Taran once again becomes the building blocks of our children's minds, and I'd be willing to embrace such a transformation.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#2")]
[name="Horn"]And if—there were those who wished this change to be rapid, an explosion even reversive of the natural trend?
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]—
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]'What is the use of an idea? You are planting a feather in the ground, imagining it growing into a fowlbeast.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#6")]
[name="Horn"]From the first poetry anthology you published. It's one of my particular favorites.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]That is my answer to this question of yours.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]In my own view, I can't, and have no thought to alter this soil. I'm simply the one trying hard to plant feathers.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Bard Williams"]And ideas fundamentally ought to be free, with no one who can interfere—each feather that grows in each person's heart may be totally unalike, just as we all have different hopes for the future of this great swathe of soil.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#1")]
[name="Horn"]I understand, Mr. Williams.
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#6")]
[name="Horn"]Allow me to speak from the heart—it's been truly pleasant to chat with you.
