[name="GreyThroat"]  ...Hello.
[Character]
[name="Child"]  Wh- who are you?
[Character]
[name="Child"]  Are you a Lungmenite?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I will not hurt you. I don't speak Ursine well. I am not an enemy.
[Character]
[name="Child"]  What did you say?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Come with me. It is dangerous here.
[Character]
[name="Child"]  I can't... Uncle said to stay here.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  But I will take you to find your dad.
[Character]
[name="Child"]  You can do that?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I can do that.
[name="GreyThroat"]  You, hiding behind me, come out.

[name="Reunion Member"]  You're...
[name="Reunion Member"]  You're not with them.
[name="Reunion Member"]  You're... from Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#4")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Child, stay back. Don't come closer.
[name="GreyThroat"]  Drop your weapon and come out with your hands up.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#4",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  What?
[name="Reunion Member"]  You're not here to save us?
[name="Reunion Member"]  Don't you Rhodes Islanders know what's hidden here?
[name="Reunion Member"]  We worked hard to set up this ambush... If we can't lure them in, if we can't take them out, they'll kill all of us!
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#4",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  You're using children as bait. You deserve to be killed.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#4",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  You think this will end when we're dead?
[name="Reunion Member"]  Even if they kill us, they won't let the children go. They won't let anyone go!
[name="Reunion Member"]  If that's all it took, we'd gladly die to save the kids!
[name="Reunion Member"]  We didn't even attack you!
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#4",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Who's killing children...? The people in the black raincoats?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#4",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  You've seen them, you understand! They're slaughtering everyone!
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  That's no excuse. After I take you in, I will apply to have you protected.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  And we're supposed to just trust you? That crossbow of yours is a killing tool, what are you protecting?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  For now, I'm protecting your lives.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  Save it. We'll deal with you, then reset our trap!
[name="Reunion Member"]  We've already got the order to form up and retreat. If we die here, it would dishonor those comrades who died to save their children!

[name="Blaze"]  Hey, that's off the top of my head! But really, I thought you were just some heartless uninfected girl, joining Rhodes Island to spy on us or whatever. I got you all wrong.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1",name2="char_017_homura_3#4",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  If I were a spy, this is how I'd get you to trust me. As long as you weren't stupid enough to let me bleed out...
[name="GreyThroat"]  You bandaged me?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1",name2="char_017_homura_3#4",focus=2)]
[name="Blaze"]  I'm still an elite operator. It's my job.
[name="Blaze"]  Anyway, you're right.
[name="Blaze"]  But even if you were a spy, you still did the right thing. So I'll save this spy's life and then pack her off to Legal.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1",name2="char_017_homura_3#4",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I could just run.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1",name2="char_017_homura_3#4",focus=2)]
[name="Blaze"]  Let's not be stupid here. How are you gonna outrun me?
[name="Blaze"]  Trust doesn't mean letting your guard down. Trust means knowing what you'll do and what you won't.
[name="Blaze"]  If you do the right thing, I'll back you up. If you do the wrong thing, I'll correct it, or stop it, if I have to. That's trust.
[name="Blaze"]  Thanks, GreyThroat. You trusted me, and you corrected my wrong thoughts with your right actions.
[name="Blaze"]  And I'm sorry.

[name="Blaze"]  If you screw up, you still need to go to Legal.

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3")]
[name="Amiya"]  I think so... at least Blaze is trying. Leave it to her to drop her prejudices so quickly.
[name="Amiya"]  Rhodes Island's elite operators have more than just their incredible combat skills. Blaze is also gifted with a gregarious personality and savoir faire. As well as her own opinions.
[name="Amiya"]  If you want to lead her, if you want her support, you'll have to gain her trust. And first, you have to learn how.
[name="Amiya"]  I've fought alongside Blaze for a long time. And I think... I think you can too, Doctor.
[Decision(options="I'm doing okay.;......;She has to cooperate.", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Amiya"]  But okay... isn't good enough, is it?
[name="Amiya"]  She puts up a carefree front, but Blaze has a complicated personality.
[name="Amiya"]  Give it time, keep your eyes open, and I know you can do it, Dr. {@nickname}.
[name="Amiya"]  But you need to put in more work!
[Predicate(references="2")]
[name="Amiya"]  Learning to trust each other isn't easy, but it needs to be done.
[name="Amiya"]  We need your power, Doctor, and you need to win over the operators to turn those tactics of yours into reality.
[name="Amiya"]  That's a lengthy process, but it's one you need to experience.
[Predicate(references="3")]
[name="Amiya"]  Blaze is an elite operator who excels in assault operations. She doesn't have much to offer in the way of strategic thinking.
[name="Amiya"]  She really needs your support. Or you could think of it like she'll turn your strategies into reality on the battlefield. She's a professional.
[name="Amiya"]  I'd say she's already cooperating.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Amiya"]  Like, look where we are now...
[name="Amiya"]  Our operators follow our orders out of a sense of duty, not trust.
[name="Amiya"]  Real trust is built on understanding. The kind Blaze is working on with GreyThroat.
[name="Amiya"]  Oh...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"]  Looks like we've got company. More Reunion.
[name="Amiya"]  Let's give Blaze a little more room to apologize. She still needs to stick her foot in her mouth a few more times.
[Decision(options="Then let's buy them some time!;......;She's the foot-in-mouth type, huh?", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Amiya"]  Yep.
[name="Amiya"]  She's a good conversationalist, but not so great at expressing her feelings.
[name="Amiya"]  What's really going on here is her confronting her deep-seated prejudices more than just an apology to GreyThroat.
[name="Amiya"]  Normal folks' prejudices against the Infected aren't a one way street... we have our own issues with the uninfected.
[name="Amiya"]  The enemy within is just as much an enemy as the enemy without.
[Decision(options="We'll defeat them both.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  ...We will.
[name="Amiya"]  Listen up.
[name="Amiya"]  Those Reunion guys were scared out of their wits.
[name="Amiya"]  Neither we nor the L. G. D. can put that kind of fear into someone. They were ready to go against everything they stood for.
[name="Amiya"]  They met something else... But what was it out there that could do that to them?
[name="Amiya"]  And... will we have to fight them too?
