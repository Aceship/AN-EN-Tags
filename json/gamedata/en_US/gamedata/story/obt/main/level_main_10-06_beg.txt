Burn this view of the city into your memories.
Every time a new skyscraper is built, countless old buildings are inevitably torn down. It is this thick layer of dust, accumulated over tens of hundreds of years, that made today's Londinium.
When you inherit these lands, not only will you inherit the extravagant furs you see on the outside. You must also accept the scars that lie underneath.
It is extraordinarily difficult to build a new house among these old ones.
Your eyes need to be able to see through the flesh and into the bones to find the place with the firmest foundation that can support the entire city.
This will be your starting point.
Vina, it is when you forget everything that you must inherit that you will truly become a proper successor.
