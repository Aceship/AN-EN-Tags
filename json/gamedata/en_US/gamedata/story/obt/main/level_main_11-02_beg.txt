From far away come strange noises.
The sort that Londiniers are quite inured to.
They confuse them all too easily, at first, with the sound of an exploding steam boiler carelessly lit, or the sound of the mechanical fowlbeasts the children so love slicing through the air.

By protection of the kings, Londinium has never once met Catastrophe before. What they face now is without a doubt a different sort of menace—and in those of long age, something stirs. The nightmare of twenty years ago has come again.
The sign of war.

[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Golding"]I know. I'd love to urge you to stay, but I know full well that not even heavy artillery could stop you.

[name="Heidi"]I know you've noticed too, Golding. Another scene change is being wrought upon Londinium tonight.
[name="Heidi"]The Duke of Stafford's troops are on the offensive at Parliament Square as we speak. The Duke of Cavendish's men arrived at the outer wall a long time earlier.
[name="Heidi"]The coup d'état over twenty years ago, and the turmoil it brought, were at least the briefest thing for the citizens here. But this time... I couldn't say.
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#8$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]This will likely develop into an inter-ducal war, and its epicenter will have been Londinium.
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#9$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]I've... come into some intel. It has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives. The sort of thing I need to deliver out of the city before tomorrow's daybreak.
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#9$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#10$1",focus=2)]
[name="Golding"]...War, you say.
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#8$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]I'm afraid so.
[name="Heidi"]The fire of war could spread to other cities at a moment's notice. Every Victorian needs to make preparations.
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#8$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Golding"]Victoria's peace has endured for over two decades since His Majesty's passing. Many call it a miracle, but I long ceased to believe it a miracle of any sort.
[name="Golding"]No one would abandon their own interest, especially when its vastness is that of Victoria's... It instead gave those with the stuff to plunder it all the more to consider.
[name="Golding"]We pitiful that live in this crack of history could only simply shut our eyes and proclaim it so. 'Peace.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#7$1",focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]Heh... who would've thought deathly illness would drive Stafford to such measures? And who could've predicted how the other dukes would respond?
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Golding"]Without the efforts of people such as yourself, this war would've broken out twenty-two years ago, instead of being delayed to today.

[name="Heidi"]Are you trying to soothe me, Golding?

[name="Golding"]I'm only stating the reality, nothing more.
[name="Golding"]You needn't reveal your goals to me, Heidi, let alone explain what your people have been planning all these years.
[name="Golding"]You need only answer me one thing—will peace come again?
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#10$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]...It will.
[name="Heidi"]That's what we've been striving for all along.
[name="Heidi"]We will protect our homeland. That is the truth, throughout the ages, that we Victorians have believed in.
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#10$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Golding"]Even if countless will die in the streets outside? Even if, with each end in sight upon the road of yours, the next preordained war comes to greet you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#10$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]Indeed.
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_647_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]Because war <i>will</i> ultimately end. It may end at the hands of us, or our posterity. When the smoke clears from the skies shrouding Victoria, no more will the children's smiles be crossed with haze.

[name="Golding"]Very well.
[name="Golding"]I'm willing to believe in you, Heidi, to try and believe.
