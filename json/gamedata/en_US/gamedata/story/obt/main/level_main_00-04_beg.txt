[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  This isn't the rendezvous point... Why are you here alone?

[name="Dobermann"]  Team E2, prepare to intercept--
[Character(name="char_014_riope")]
[name="Ace"]   Dobermann, don't get overzealous. Retreating is our top priority!

[Character(name="char_014_riope")]
[name="Ace"]  That's right. We still have to press on to the next rendezvous point.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]

[name="Ace"]  Just like the good ol' days.

[name="Amiya"]   Um, Ace...
[name="Amiya"]   Actually, something unexpected has happened.
[name="Amiya"]   Doctor... is suffering from amnesia.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4",name2="char_014_riope",focus=2)]
[name="Ace"]   ...I see.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]
[name="Amiya"]   I'm sorry, Ace... But compared to before, a lot has changed.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4",name2="char_014_riope",focus=2)]
[name="Ace"]   Is that so? You don't need to apologize to me.
[name="Ace"]   Have the Doctor's commanding capabilities suffered as a result of the amnesia?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="char_014_riope",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   ...As sharp as before.
[name="Amiya"]   Doctor's decisionmaking is still absolutely reliable. I can promise you this.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="char_014_riope",focus=2)]
[name="Ace"]   Very well then. I'll follow the Doctor's orders then.
[name="Ace"]   What has been lost can be found again.
[name="Ace"]   Right now, there's a more imminent problem on our hands.

[name="Reunion Member"]   Go. Release your inner beast, and let them feel your fangs!


[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]

[name="Reunion Member"]   An ambush?!


[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]   Team E3 has been moving undercover this whole time... I see, they've been waiting for us to pincer the enemy.
[Character(name="char_014_riope" )]
[name="Ace"]   When communications are jammed, our teams should operate near the rendezvous point. That way, even if something happens to me or the scout...
[name="Ace"]   The broader operation can still be carried out. This is my decision-making.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  In other words, Ace, you left your team back at the rendezvous point and came here alone...
[Character(name="char_014_riope" )]
[name="Ace"]   After all, neutralizing threats around the rendezvous point is our top objective.
[name="Ace"]   Of course, prioritizing checking on your status is a big risk. There's no way I could imperil the entire team.
[name="Ace"]   The whole reason teams exist is to increase tactical efficiency, not the other way around.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Hah. Let's continue our discussion after we've taken care of Reunion!
[Character(name="char_014_riope" )]
[name="Ace"]   Amiya, you're up.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]   Understood! I'll back you up with my Arts!
[Character(name="char_014_riope" )]
[name="Ace"]   Finally...
[name="Ace"]   Dr {@nickname}, please command Rhodes Island.
