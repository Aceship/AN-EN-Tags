Smoke and thick fog tug and tear at one another.
The deck of the Gastrell is teeming with the seeds and withered branches of the Nachzehrers. Seventy percent of the guns that once breached countless fortresses have now fallen silent.
Its teeth almost completely pulled and its talons whetted smooth, the logical next step is for this prey to be dismantled and devoured.
However, the Nachzehrer's throne has also been pierced by dozens of chain-ladled fortcrackers.
With just one move, the God of War could be pulled from his throne.

Vina remembers the first time she saw a high-speed battleship.
It was sitting on her father's desk. A small scale model, only as long as an adult's forearm. Its crystal flagpole would fall over with just a little poke.
Her father pushed her touchy-feely hands away, telling her that high-speed battleships are akin to metallic monsters that conquer the land. They, like the indomitable city of Londinium, were the crowning jewels of Victoria's industrial technology.
'Alexandrina, when you are older, I will take you aboard the newest battleship. You will see for yourself.'
Many years later, when Vina did in fact see one, it was only upon the battlefield.
Be it Windermere's, Caster's, or Wellington's warship, they were so majestic that the people standing beneath them were mere specks in comparison.
But at this moment, the broken warship in the palm of the colossal Originium wave before her seems to have reverted to the tiny toy she played with in her childhood.
