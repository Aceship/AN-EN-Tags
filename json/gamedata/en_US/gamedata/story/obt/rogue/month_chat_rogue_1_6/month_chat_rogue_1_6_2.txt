[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=1)]I told you, stop staring at me all the time. You wanted me to protect you like I do with the rest of the U.S.S.G., right? I said I would.
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=1)]No, that's not it. Even if you are the famous General, defender of the weak, it's not like I need your protection.
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=1)]Oh... I get it, 'The General'. You were embarrassed to meet a real Ursus general just now, weren't you?
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=1)]...No.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]Don't get me wrong. I sure as hell didn't wanna seem like some kid playing pretend. Not that I even gave myself this nickname.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=1)]But it'll come. I'll earn honors. I'll be promoted, decorated. Even if it's not in Ursus.
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=1)]Now that you mention it, apparently General Hellagur still wears some of his Ursus military medals.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=1)]Still? Which campaign could be that important to him?
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=0.5)]He never talks about his past, so I'm not sure which battle he earned them from either.
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=1)]But according to him, he was gathering up whatever he thought could sell as he took the children away from Chernobog.
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=1)]Just in case, so he'd have more options if his cooperation with Rhodes Island fell through.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]Huh? You mean he was going to sell his medals?
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=0.5)]Mhm. He says the children at the clinic needed medicine, and heaters for the winter. They didn't need his past.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=1)]...Never heard of any clinic treating Infected while I was there.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=1)]That's a good thing. It shows that both you and the children at the Clinic were living in safety.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]Oh, it's yâ€”General Hellagur.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]'Were' being the operative word there... There's nothing left now. Let's drop this.
