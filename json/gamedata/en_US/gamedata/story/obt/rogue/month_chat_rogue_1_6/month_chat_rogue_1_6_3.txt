[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=1)]Lemme look at your Ursus Army ribbon... Um, if that's okay with you? Please?
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=0.5)]Of course. Although being so far removed from Ursus now, it's no more than a plain red ribbon.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=0.5)]I gather that 'General' wasn't meant as a compliment, among the youth.
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=0.5)]It was just, the Army never came to take control of the situation, even in the city's final hours. That's what disappointed everyone so badly.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]But to be honest, it's not like we really trusted the Army before that either.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]I mean, screw them, though. I like the nickname.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]Yeah yeah... I know I'm a far cry from a real general. Laugh at me all you want.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]But I'm gonna protect everyone in the U.S.S.G, and I'll topple anything that gets in our way. I swear.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=1)]If you're that fond of the title, then by all means, take the ribbon.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=0.5)]But it has no worth at all, now that battle has torn it in two. Perhaps you deserve a better gift.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]Th-The book, then. Istina said you were writing a book. We'd all love to read it.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=1)]My book? I doubt you'd a find a book about the past to be worth reading.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=0.5)]I might have other books, that write of things to come. Let me take a look.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=0.5)]In the meantime, would you like some candy? I carry some with me.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]...No thanks, I don't like sweets.
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=0.5)]Me neither.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=1)]Haha, no need to be ashamed of liking sweet things. You're still children, after all.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=0.5)]Winter in Ursus is a long one, and fiercely cold, but we endure it. All so we may see the days of melting snow.
