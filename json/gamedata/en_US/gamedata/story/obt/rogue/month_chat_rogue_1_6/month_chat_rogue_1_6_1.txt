[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=1)]Ah, General Hellagur.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=0.5)]...General?
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=0.5)]Ha ha, I see that title's spread its way around.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=0.5)]I did once hold the rank of Ursus general, but now I'm nothing more than a warrior following Rhodes Island's orders.
[Dialog(head="char_115_headbr", delay=1)](Footsteps)
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=0.5)]Hey, wait... Zima, where are you going?
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=0.5)]Sorry, I think she might not want to hear about Ursus. Even if it has been a while by now.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=0.5)]Is she too from Peterheim Middle School? The one you said Reunion's captain demanded be guarded?
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=0.5)]Yes... Um, please don't sigh.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=0.5)]It is difficult not to, upon being faced with how we as a people have failed those children.
[Dialog(head="char_188_helage", delay=1)]Thank goodness you appear to get along well, from what I've seen. There aren't many students your age aboard this landship, and fewer still from Ursus.
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=1)]DO we get along? Well... I guess we're alright.
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=0.5)]At least, ever since I approached them, I haven't spent so much time wondering... whether it was really worth it. About a lot of things.
[Dialog(head="char_405_absin", delay=0.5)]*sigh* I'll go find her and see what's wrong.
