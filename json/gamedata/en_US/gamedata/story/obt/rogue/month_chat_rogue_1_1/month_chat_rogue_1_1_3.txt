[Dialog(head="char_311_mudrok", delay=0)]Do you still have your own mark, then, Vampire?
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]Yes, I keep it on me.
[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=0.5)]You're pretty much the same as those old squares, then, huh?
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]What do you know, you little Sarkaz? I use this thing for stamping files now.
[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=0.5)]So you're saying every file's got—
[Dialog(head="char_311_mudrok", delay=0.5)]—the scent a Vampire favors?
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]No, it just smells like red seal ink!
[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=1)]I don't believe you. Lemme sniff it.
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]Go on, sniff all you want.
[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=1)]Smells pretty good.
[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=0)](Stamp)
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]Vigna, what are you doing? That's not how you're meant to use the mark!
[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=0.5)]Here, Mudrock.
[Dialog(head="char_311_mudrok", delay=1)](Stamp)
[Dialog(head="char_311_mudrok", delay=0.5)]Thank you, Vampire.
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]Ugh...
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]You two, seriously... who goes and brands themselves with a mark?
[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=1)]Aren't we friends?
[Dialog(head="char_311_mudrok", delay=0.5)]Yes. Friends.
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]......
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0)]*Sigh*, suit yourselves.
