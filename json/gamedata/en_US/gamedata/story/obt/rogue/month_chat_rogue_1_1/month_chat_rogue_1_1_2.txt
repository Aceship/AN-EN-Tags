[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=0)]I forgot to ask last time, but why do you Vampires put stamps on your best friends?
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]'Stamp' is far too crude a way of putting it. They're brands, you know.
[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=0.5)]Fine... so what do brands do, exactly?
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=1)]Every Vampire has a scent they're fond of, and are especially sensitive to. A brand can forever leave this scent upon another, so that even if our loved ones are kilometers out, we can still smell them.
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=1)]To a certain extent, it also sends a sort of message to other Vampires that 'this person is under my protection,' of course.
[Dialog(head="char_311_mudrok", delay=0.5)]Do you display your companionship in such a manner too, Vampire?
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]*Sigh* If you're one of the walking relics stuck forever in the past, you would, but no one else shows friendship that way anymore. I'm a realistic person here.
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]Let your friends live on in your heart. What do you need the bizarre ritual for?
[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=0.5)]It's weird to process you being all common-sensical about this.
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0.5)]Of course, if you're willing to sign on a disclaimer and participate in an experiment of mine, I wouldn't refuse you.
[Dialog(head="char_311_mudrok", delay=1)]I will return to tend to my soil, Vampire.
[Dialog(head="char_290_vigna", delay=0.5)]I think I gotta go to rehearsal too. Me and Mudrock'll catch you later.
[Dialog(head="char_171_bldsk", delay=0)]Waâ€”Wait, you can still participate, even if you don't sign the waiver! Come back!
