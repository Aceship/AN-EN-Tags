[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=1)]The Crimson Troupe.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]Yes. It's a stub for a Crimson Troupe performance.
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]But there's nothing written about what performance.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]The performers were puppets to the roles. The roles chose the program, impromptu.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]So naturally, nothing needed to be written.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=1)]Where did you find this stub, Iris?
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]In the library of the Castle of Dreams. I assume it was Grandmother, or maybe another denizen, who left it.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]The Castle of Dreams... the age-old Victorian fairytale?
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Mm. Yes, quite.
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]I'm gathering that the Crimson Troupe is something similar?
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]If it will satisfy your curiosity, then I can give you an precise answer.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]It is.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=1)]But it's not something a child would yearn for. It's a terrifying tragedy, that strikes without warning.
[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=1.5)]Shalem, are you okay?
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]I'm sorry, I seem to have overreacted a little.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]But now that you know the truth, what will you do with this, Iris?
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]I ought to return it to where it was, shouldn't I?
[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=0.5)]It sounds like a very reliable way to settle things.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]Phew... thank you.
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=1)]Oh, my. The tea's gone cold.
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Could I trouble you to fetch us some fresh cups?
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)](Faint chuckle)
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]I would be glad to.
