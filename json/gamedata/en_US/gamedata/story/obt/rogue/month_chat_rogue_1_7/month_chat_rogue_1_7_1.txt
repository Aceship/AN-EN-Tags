[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=1)]Are the two of you thirsty? I'll fetch some drinks.
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Plain black tea for me, thank you.
[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=0.5)]I'd like some lemon squash, Shalem.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]Black tea... lemon squash... alright, and how about a little pastry stand too?
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Well! That would be wonderful.
[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=0.3)]Yes, please.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]Just a moment, then.
[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=2)]I swear we were here to have tea together. I wonder why he's suddenly serving us now...
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Isn't it nice to have someone want to serve you?
[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=0.5)]I suppose, but...
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Oh, yes, this thing. Do you have any recollection of it?
[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=1)]What is this... a red ticket stub?
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Mm. I was back at the Castle of Dreams to look for something, and I found it being used as a bookmark.
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Grandmother wasn't home, I returned to find Bena and she had no clue either, and so my only option was to ask a fellow Victorian at a tea party.
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Hmm... I really want to know what show this is!
[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=0.5)]Curiosity killed the Feline, you know. You'd better be careful...
