[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]Well...
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]It seems you know what this is, Shalem.
[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=0.5)]That's fantastic. You went to the right person after all, Iris.
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]I'm sorry, allow me a moment to think.
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Fine. I'm not in a rush.
[Dialog(head="char_208_melan", delay=0.5)](Faint sips of tea)

[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Well, now? Is the color that significant?
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=1.5)]Um...
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=1)]My, Shalem, the blood's drained from your face.
[Dialog(head="char_338_iris", delay=0.5)]Let's look at this shade again, shall we? Is this the Crimson—what was it?
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]Hrmm...
[Dialog(head="char_4025_aprot2", delay=0.5)]You're very smart, Iris.
