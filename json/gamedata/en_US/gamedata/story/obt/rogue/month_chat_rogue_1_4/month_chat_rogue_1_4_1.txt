[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=1.5)]I can sense it. There's a curse on this land.
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=1.5)]Even now, it saps my strength little by little, from the deepest recesses of my soul, devouring me from within until naught remains...
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=1.5)]I feel it too...
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]Use your own words.
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=0.5)]I'm beat.
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]I'm hungry.
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]Get it together, you guys. We just left!
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=1)]Dur-nar! Any more food?
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]No can do. We each get our fair share of rations when we're on the march. No sneaking in snacks.
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]Just a little!
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]No.
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]*whine*...
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=1)]Alright, fine. An army fights on its stomach, I guess... In that case, we'll take five right here.
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=0.5)]The journey of the brave is awash with despair, no whisper of when fated replenishment will finally beckon...
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=1)]Neat, I found a thing!
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]What is this, a metal hammer?
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]That's some rust. Must've been dumped here forever ago.
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=0.5)]Hmm. The craftsmanship is superlative though. Why abandon it?
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=1)]Garghâ€”
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]No, Kay! You can't eat it!
