[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=1)]You guys ever heard of the Rusthammers?
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]Um... Uh-uh.
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]They're this real extreme gang of bandits. I hear they're active in every region of every country.
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=1)]They carefully plan out every raid, and their tactics are good enough to go toe to toe with whole city militias.
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=1)]Their combat style is, in a word, insane. You often hear about mercs escorting caravans that lose their nerve without the Rusthammers even lifting a finger. 
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=1)]Back when I was serving, they were a hell of a thorn in our side.
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=1)]You saw them all the time back in Sargon. But they wouldn't necessarily be plundering passing caravans.
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=0.5)]At times they'd even head out to help people stranded in the wastes, of their own accord.
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]Sounds like Sargon's Rusthammers would duke it out with Columbia's, if they ever met.
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=0.5)]Now, the real question is whether 'barbarism rebels against civilization' or 'civilization itself gives rise to barbarism.'
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]That's sure one to chew on...
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=1)]Wait, you mean those guys who wear really beat-up clothes and live in tents?
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]They gave me food before! They're good guys! 
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=1)]Um...
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=1)]Er...
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]Huh? Why'd you stop talking?
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]I-It's nothing, let's press on.
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]Oh, yeah, Kay. What happened to the hammer you picked up?
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]Um, I thought it was way too heavy, so I threw it away.
