[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=1)]There goes the last of the snacks I keep in reserve...
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]No more eating anything weird, Kay.
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]Thanks, Dur-nar! I'm full now!
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=0.5)]Then perhaps I too shouldâ€”
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]Don't push your luck!
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=1)]*sigh*... So, back to this hammer.
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]See this pennant on the handle?
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]Don't you guys think it looks like a flag?
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=0.5)]An anonymous flag? Just what does it stand for?
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=1)]I can hear it saying stuff!
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]Like my other weapons!
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]I'm gonna keep it. Hup!
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]Whoa, kinda heavy. Really gonna hurt for the bad guys!
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=1)]All the rust just fell off?! Like it turned into sand!
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]Is that your Arts, Kay?
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=0.5)]Harmonization with weapons! It's the Soul Resonance I've been forever seeking!
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]No, it's Arts! Originium Arts!
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]This hammer speaks really weird. I don't get it.
[Dialog(head="char_379_sesa", delay=0.5)]What is it 'saying'?
[Dialog(head="char_2013_cerber", delay=0.5)]Annihilate all nomadic cities!
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=1)]You can't be serious. Is it connected to THEM? That's a little on-the-nose, isn't it?
[Dialog(head="char_260_durnar", delay=0.5)]Whatever. You hold onto it for now, Kay. Let's move.
