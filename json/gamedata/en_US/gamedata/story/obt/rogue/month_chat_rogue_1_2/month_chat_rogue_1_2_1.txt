[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0)]In the Hall of Heroes, there has forever been a legend.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]It tells of a priest of devotion, fearlessness and heroism true, bestowed with the rare honor of bearing the Evergreen Ivy. Thus the priest protects the warriors who fight for Minos, until the Ivy wilts in hand...
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=1.5)]No natural plant can truly be evergreen in its triumph.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]Ah, indeed, indeed! How fair a legend it is to hear, yet how cruel too!
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]They call it Evergreen, and why should it wither still?
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]Hah-hah, so legends usually go. No need to lose too much sleep over it, Miss Priest.
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]Come to mention it, I think I've heard a similar rumor in my time.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]Oh? It must surely be a story just as riveting, then?
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]It's just something from my youngling years. Ah, it's been too long. The details escape me now.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]Alas! Then it is truly a tale ancient to rival history's epics.
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]Hardly. I just remember a soldier from another land, who told us children plenty of stories.
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]I remember the soldier once referred to a dead branch that kept on sprouting new buds. It took your story to remind this old man of it.
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=2)]Did this soldier you mention come from Gaul?
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]Correct. No wonder you've heard tell, doctor.
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]How mighty Gaul was, in those days. And nobody ever speaks of it now... hah-hah, I think we've gotten sidetracked.
