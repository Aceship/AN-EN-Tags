[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]Eternal life...
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=1)]The 'Proof of Longevity.' The name the Gauls assigned it.
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=1)]It doesn't hurt to live a little longer, but longevity is its own topic.
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]I think I'm far, far enough gone from the woodlands by now. I couldn't go any further if I tried, and I wouldn't want to.
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=0.5)]Hmm...
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=1)]Be that as it may, what of the fate of the Gaulish collector who possessed this miraculous branch?
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=0.5)]As far as I know, it never brought any holder any good luck.
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=0.5)]The last holder was in a comical stage outfit when their foe impaled them. The first belted songs while going mad, and soon after fell from a cliff.
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=1)]And in the most famous of all the rumors...
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=0.5)]It's said the unlucky soul ate half their own body's flesh. Death by blood loss, in the end.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=1)]Oh, wellaway, wellaway...
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]I'm afraid nobody knows whatever the truth may be now, or whether those rumors are real or not.
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]There's always some types who believe they can outrun death, open their eyes again.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=1)]Longevity... ah, alas, such a lamentable miracle.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]Our lives are finite, but the name that stands for faith in the people's hearts, it does not fade. It is immortal.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]The hero's ardent yet pure life is an imperishable spark. Its fire will endure and burn long, yet who of those who light it would forever consume themselves?
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=2)]In practice, no one could.
