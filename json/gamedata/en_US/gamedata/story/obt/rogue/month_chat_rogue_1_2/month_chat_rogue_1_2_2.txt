[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=0)]A dried branch.
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=0.5)]New buds drawn from the most withered places, then rotting and wilting on the most vigorous leaves.
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=0.5)]A forever growing stem, sterility and exuberance twisted together, the newborn portion devouring the dead as nourishment, the dead finding birth anew from within its own life.
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=1.5)]It's odd for me to imagine, hearing this story again after so many years.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]How miraculous...!
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=0.5)]It isn't just a story.
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=0.5)]This branch exists in reality. I once witnessed it on the land of a celebrated Gaulish noble.
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=1)]But all trace of it has been lost to the fires of war by now.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]That truly is a shame. If ever I had the chance to see it for myself...
[Dialog(head="char_503_rang", delay=0.5)]Ah. I'd think you'd be better off without, really.
[Dialog(head="char_485_pallas", delay=0.5)]And wherefore?
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=0.5)]I can answer that for you.
[Dialog(head="char_003_kalts", delay=1)]Rumors say that obtaining this branch means obtaining rebirthâ€”obtaining eternal life.
