Skadi floats to the surface.
She is followed by several Seaborn hatchlings.
They are not her offspring, but someone must care for them when their progenitors are still reproducing in the depths.
She has taken up the task as part of We Many.
Skadi's original species once inhabited massive underwater steel constructs.
The Ã†gir chose to become part of We Many after making contact with the Seaborn.
The signs of evolution are upon them, even if their forms have not yet changed.
Until now.
......
Skadi finds a suitable skerry and climbs up, sitting where sea meets land.
The hatchlings seem afraid to leave the water. Their immature anatomies find the dryness uncomfortable. After some trial and error, they choose to attach themselves to the rock wall, curiously scanning the world above the surface with their visual organs.
Skadi takes out a lyre, tunes it, and begins playing.
She sings.
It is a song that knows neither trouble nor sorrow.
It is full of love and kindness.
The hatchlings stretch out and sing along with their developing vocal organs.
Native Seaborns do not understand emotion, but some of them are able to recognize it and draw strength from it.
The Seaborn will come to understand that which does not belong to them, when they learn to make a song on their own and understand the power within.
And now, they are learning the meaning of learning.
......
Hear, hear, Skadi sings.
