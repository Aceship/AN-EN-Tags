The girl wakes up from the dream with a start. The starlight in her dream lingers in her mind.
How long has it been since she started traveling and studying with 'Grandpa Bishop'? The girl finds it difficult to trace the passage of time, for her life is divided into the time before she witnessed the starlight, and the time after.
She believes that she is awake, serious, determined. If there is something that can prove the value of life, validate the truth of her thoughts, she will reach out to it, embrace it.
'Grandpa' said that not everyone walks the same bridge, nor is it a privilege to walk that bridge. Humanity's possibilities are infinite. All means are merely tools, and it is the end, not the means, that should become the object of worship. He always preached recognizing what one truly wants to do and become, and refusing to accept easy, simple answers.
But I have seen my path. It lies before me, the opportunity of a lifetime. The pact that 'Grandpa' made with his old friend lies silent in the box. 'Grandpa' must have run into trouble, because he has not been back for two days. One more day, and this hideout and everything here will be destroyed, as he arranged.
But none of this matters. Its pulse and breath guide my heartbeat. It is the salvation that I had long sought but never received. Reach out, open the box, drink the pact of the ocean, and I will return to the day when time stopped, and rebuild myself with the starlight reflected off the surface of the ocean.
If the starlight is too bright, then I will go blind for it.
