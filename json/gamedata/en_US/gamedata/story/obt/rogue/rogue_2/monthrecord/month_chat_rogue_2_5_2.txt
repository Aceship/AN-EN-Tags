One dance after another, yet her partners are always silent.
Laurentina tires of it. This is not a true dance. Broken limbs dissolve in the water, but the singing is deafening.
It is their song. She acknowledges its beauty, but it cannot catch up to her steps.
Her final partner turns to dust. Its photophore grows dim, and she is once again in familiar darkness. There are no waves deep in the ocean, replaced by the omnipresent weight of the sea. Is this peace? Laurentina is perplexed. Fragments of thought tell her that peace should be shared with others. Peace comes with another song.
One that is warmer, gentler.
What was the tune? She closes her eyes and tries to remember, but their chanting is cacophonous and inexorable. They snuff out the slightest ripple, allowing only themselves to linger in eternity.
A blurred silhouette flashes across her mind. Peace...
Is it peace? Or is it fear?
Laurentina takes a few steps forward. She stands on her toes, then pirouettes. Her arms should be lighter, lither. Then she bends down, and turns again.
Should her hands be holding something? Had she danced these steps with someone else in the past?
Where is that 'someone else' now?
As a partner they were clumsy, but far better than... these.
Memories, entangled like threads. Laurentina knows how to untangle them and find the one she seeks, but decides against it.
What is the point? She does not know where it will take her, and she does not want to know.
What has come to pass is more abhorrent than what is to come.
It is time for the next song. Their chorus is overwhelming.
Laurentina does not want to be overtaken by the song. She straightens out her skirt, and welcomes the next group of dance partners.
