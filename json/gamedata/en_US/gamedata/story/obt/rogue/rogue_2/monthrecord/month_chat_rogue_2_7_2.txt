Ægir's Abyssal Hunter project ended when the last Hunter was assimilated.
The consuls voted unanimously to eliminate the mutants and reassess the response against the Seaborn.
But they did not know that the Hunters retained their free will.
......
Skadi swims towards the surface, surrounded by her kin.
They have lost their human forms and become Seaborn.
The curse binding them together by blood has shown its true face.
They can never go home. Ægir has sworn to destroy them.
They will not become part of We Many. They will not bow to the Seaborn, not even in death.
Thus, they have chosen self-exile. To where the ocean has not yet reached, in search of a hope that has almost faded.
In this journey towards despair, the Abyssal Hunters have been nearly hunted to extinction, both by the Seaborn and by Ægir.
A dozen vestiges of humanity swim towards land in silence.
They have lost their weapons, and their faith.
All they have left are their troubling husks, and their suffering souls.
Skadi wants to sing, but the song comes out of her vocal organs as an unfathomable growl.
Her song exists only in her mind now.
When death comes for her, there will be no one left to remember its beautiful melody.
