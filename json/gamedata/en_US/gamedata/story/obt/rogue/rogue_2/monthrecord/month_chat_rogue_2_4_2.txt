The girl wakes up from the dream with a start. The starlight in her dream lingers in her mind.
She looks at one hand, and the other, and the other, and perhaps the other too. She finds that they and they are scooping up handful after handful of starlight. How could it be? How could the starlight that was so far away be so easily grasped in her hands?
The joy is intense. She subconsciously spreads herself out and begins to spin and dance. The stars seem to understand her joy, and begin to dance in orbit around her, even without...
Without music? It should not be so. Limbs are rhythm, and starlight melody. But why is there no song? Is there no instrument?
No, no... why is it dark? Why does the starlight not shine upon here, or upon me? Why is it not warm?
Is it because it is dry? Do the limbs not feel warmth because they are dry? Does the throat make no sound because it is dry? Then look up and call for rain. Drown out the noises, and sing one last song.
Warm musical notes fall from my hide one after another, transforming into a shining, translucent melody, wrapped in bubbles of every color.
I will become starlight.
