[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]Nearl, I'm sure you have status jewelry like this in your family, don't you?
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]...Bloodlines and reputation are but temporary splendors of the ruling class. The glory they accord them is so easily wiped away. Just like this brooch.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=1.5)]The gold is merely a manifestation of ornamental nature. What it truly relies on in battle are these Originium circuits. If the pressure exerted exceeds what the circuit can ward...
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=1.5)]Then as simply as that...
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)](Attacking sound)
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]The warding falters.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]Let's take a break, and give the circuit the time it needs to recharge.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]My, my, you were at my throat for a moment there. I almost couldn't block you.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]Break time? Then can I take a look at the brooch? Hmm...
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]The Originium crystals on top are definitely precious. Very valuable for research.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]Solid Originium crystals of this purity aren't common. Nor are they easily extracted, without just as much funding and tech.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)](Sounds of breathing)
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]There's not enough light here. Shame. I can't quite make them out clearly.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]I'd love to take it to my workbench, and find the time to give them a decent look...
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]What a brooch... If only I could just buy it for myself.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)](Sounds of breathing)
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]...Why are you two so quiet?
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=1)]Can't get a word in edgeways.
