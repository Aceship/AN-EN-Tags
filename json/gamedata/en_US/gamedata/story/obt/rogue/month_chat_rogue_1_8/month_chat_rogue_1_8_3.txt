[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]Okay, final attack! Once I get these figures recorded, we can go.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)](Sounds of writing)
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]The crown jewel's workmanship is dependent to a certain degree on high-purity Originium crystals embedded in the surface layer...
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]I agreed to meet Maria soon. Do you think you could let me borrow the brooch, just for now?
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]Hm... I trust you wouldn't break it, but I'll go with you, just in case.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=1)]Oh, yes. So Maria's your little sister?
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]That's right.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]So does the little scamp ever badmouth you in her dreams?
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]What? ...Of course not.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]Oh? Then it seems to me you aren't getting along very well.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]Hm?
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)](Sounds of writing)
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]Reliance on Originium crystal purity circuits can better...
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]Is speaking ill of someone in your sleep a sign of getting along?
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]It's a form of closeness, at any rate.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]As a role model for her, it's imperative that I maintain a kind image for her at all times.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]But what does our girl like?
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]...workmanship too complex w.r.t. energy storage, reproduction infeasible.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]She likes to repair machines. She's wanted to be a craftsman since she was a child.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]She's also fond of some fruits. In dessert form.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]Well, MINE comes to me for consolation every time she trips over her own jacket.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]Maria once told me that she loved watching me train in the garden more than anything.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=1)]...The brooch.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]...We're done here for now, Earthspirit. We'll be leaving.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]...mm, fine...
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]We'll be back before you know it.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]Yes, yes, I heard you. Based on above, I believe research can be focused on technological renewal...
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)](Sounds of writing)
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]...Mm, and that's that.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]Alright, everyone, the mission report is all filled out. I'll go hand it in. Remember to turn the lights off when you leave.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=2)]...Hello?
