[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]Good day, everyone. I'm Carnelian.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]Greetings. I've already checked over our mission requirements. We can begin at any time.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]Hello, everyone. If the meet and greet's over, let's start ASAP.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]Is this that brooch you mentioned?
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]Yes, one of the Gaulish royal family's crown jewels.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]Leithanian nobles like to collect them as a badge of status. I came across it in my study abroad.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]There's a plain old Originium circuit mounted on the back, loaded with defensive Arts. The Engineering Department was very intrigued. I managed to exchange for medication.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=1.5)]Understood. So, what's the test method?
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=0.5)]You and I, Nearl, will take turns wearing this brooch, and the other attacks us to test how effectively it resists different forms of aggression. Earthspirit will handle the logging.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=1.5)]Right. Recording equipment all ready.
[Dialog(head="char_183_skgoat", delay=0.5)]But why are you here for this, Nearl?
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=0.5)]In exchange for assisting with Carnelian's test, I'll be allowed to show the brooch to Maria afterward.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=1)]Mm. The Engineering Department were at their wit's end finding two people to do this for them. One of us wants an eyeful of its high-purity Originium crystals, and the other is doing it for her craft-loving sister.
[Dialog(head="char_426_billro", delay=1.5)]Not many on Rhodes Island have both the experience and just so happen to be off-duty right now. I appreciate that the two of you were so willing to come.
[Dialog(head="char_148_nearl", delay=1)]It's no problem. After all, I've gained a chance to give Maria a nice surprise. Let's get started, then.
