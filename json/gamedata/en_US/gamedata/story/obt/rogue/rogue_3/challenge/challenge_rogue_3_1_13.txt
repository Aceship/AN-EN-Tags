There is no need to look back at where we came from. No matter how many warriors and explorers were buried by the snowstorm, no matter how many of their kind gave their lives to raise the veil against demonic encroachment, the Cyclopes and the outcast who ignored the order of morality had finally reached the end of the icefields.
Now, the giant ring looms in front of them, just as prophesized, its awe-inspiring beauty completely incongruous with the icefield.
It should have been a way out, a door to the future. It is the star the oracle had looked up to in her dreams countless times.
It looked... full of hope.
After countless sacrifices, after countless people apologizing and entrusting her with things in their dying breaths, she had no choice but to be hopeful about it.
The oracle reaches out to the star.
Nobody follows. Nobody cheers her feat. And no star falls to the earth.
After a period of time no longer possessing any linear meaning, only the same deep void remains, both inside and outside the door.
