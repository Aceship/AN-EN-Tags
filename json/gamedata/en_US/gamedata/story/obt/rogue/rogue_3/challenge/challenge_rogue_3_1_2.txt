'I write this letter with immense guilt upon learning that you are a former rescue squad member who has left Sami. The vast majority of people are indifferent to Sami, so I can only turn to you with this request.'
While at Rhodes Island, Qanipalaat receives a letter.
The sender is a Columbian plant enthusiast. When he entered the Myrkwood to observe its ecology, he was unfortunately beset by a snowstorm. The vehicle he was driving was struck by a giant falling tree, and half the car was buried beneath the falling snow. Fortunately, a member of the rescue squad located him and blew the rock horn to call for help. Everyone worked hard to drag the injured man out of the car and transfer him to an open area nearby.
But what happened next filled him with regrets. When the rescue squad members tried to use Arts to melt the ice and snow freezing the trunk of the vehicle, heat-inducing Arts triggered an explosion of the Originium fuel inside the vehicle, causing members of the rescue squad caught in the epicenter of the accident to suffer varying degrees of burns and show signs of Oripathy infection. Furthermore, two members were left disabled due to their lack of experience in dealing with such traumas.
'We're the ones who brought these Originium machines over, yet we're unable to solve the problems they cause. If Sami's rescue team had more experience communicating with the outside, or if more disaster relief from other countries were willing to come here, we might've been better prepared to deal with these technology-related accidents.
'Maybe, that explosion would never have happened in the first place.'
