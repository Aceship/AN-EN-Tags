Rhodes Island continues to receive signals from the research outpost.
Due to a certain decision, the landship docked near Sami half a month ago. Kal'tsit and the Doctor had already led a small team away towards the icefield. At first, the stationed operator thought it was intel sent back by the Rhodes Island team after successfully reaching the outpost. However, the intermittent signal did not match the voiceprint of any Rhodes Island operator, and the report contained a large amount of professional jargon, possibly involving confidential research results.
The signal was quickly cut off. Over the next half month, every signal sent from the research outpost was dead silence.
By the time they ceased entirely, Rhodes Island had received a total of seventy-five meaningless transmissions. A week after the signals stopped coming, the Rhodes Island team returned to the landship. Everyone kept silent about the situation in Sami and the icefield. Kal'tsit and the Doctor began dispatching Messengers to every corner of the land.
They already know one thing for certain. Rhodes Island only received the signal by chance, because the user had found the sole method of transmitting their message.
And despite the fact that research into the icefields has been suspended indefinitely, some are still encouraging outsiders to continue exploring through perilous secret passages, even delineating clear routes for these persistent explorers.
In that research station, one visitor after another had carried out their final obsession before becoming completely corrupted.
They had cried hopelessly and silently for Sami, through the only channel left to them.
