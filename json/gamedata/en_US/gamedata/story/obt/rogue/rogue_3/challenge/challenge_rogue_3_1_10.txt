Santalla chases after the black footprints alone.
She had heard of Ursus's Royal Guard. The arrogant people of Ursus who went as far as to declare the permanent damage they inflicted upon the land their 'Dominion.' Wheresoever their absurd ambitions might extend into Sami, Santalla must deny them, put a halt to them.
It has become incredibly difficult to press forward. The footprints left by the enemy have become intermittent. Sometimes, they seem to cross a natural chasm in a single stride; sometimes, they seem to vanish into thin air. At other times, they seem to leave behind abnormal weather and dead beasts in their wake. Despite this, Santalla still catches up to the black shadow.
When she finally catches a glimpse of its appearance, she finally understands her own fate as well.
That corrupted monster could no longer be killed, only stopped at best. And the shaman, just like the resolute ice, would have her footsteps frozen here forever.
