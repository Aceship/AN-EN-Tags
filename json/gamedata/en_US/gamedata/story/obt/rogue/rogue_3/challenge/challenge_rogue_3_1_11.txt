The expedition is proceeding smoothly. Before the team embarked, the Cyclops had predicted with unparalleled accuracy the various troubles they would encounter. The only thing left for them to do was figure out how to carefully circumvent, or, as inexperienced amateurs, how to resolve the foreseen crises. In their opinion, this isn't particularly difficult.
The squad successfully arrives at the hillside where the black hornbeast dwells, and sends the Messenger accompanying them back to report on the expedition's status.
As the prophecy said, there is no day here, only starry nights. Everyone feels their heads spinning, either due to nerves or excitement. Perhaps the unique gemstone deposits she had foreseen are nearby.
'When I set out, the people trying to stop me said she can't actually see the future at all.' To lighten the atmosphere, one of the squad members jeered loudly, 'If you ask me, those cowards were probably just afraid that she went crazy and got a bit TOO accurate.'
Hearing their voices, another expedition team emerges from the darkness of the valley.
The explorers who had just arrived cheer even louder. They rush forward to embrace the first living people they've seen on their journey.
But their laughter stops abruptly.
Because what they face beneath those thick clothes are pitch-black voids.
......
The Messenger brings the report to Arges. Their whereabouts become a secret forever submerged in the shadows, their story becoming part of the Cyclops's prophecies.
For a long time now, the only thing that's remained in the Cyclops' eye is a singular tragedy.
All she can see is an apocalyptic ring.
