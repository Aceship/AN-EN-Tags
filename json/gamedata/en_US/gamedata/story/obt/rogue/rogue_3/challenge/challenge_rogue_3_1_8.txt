There are no roads in the icefields, only a vast silvery-white expanse with no end in sight. But this is exactly the kind of long journey that Typhon enjoys.
Arges gazes at the future, but Typhon's eyes must focus on the present – and the crisis in front of her.
So many times, Typhon could only watch on in regret as the outline of her back gradually disappeared. But now, for the first time ever, she is traveling with Arges.
Arges remains cautious and silent as usual, and does not explain her goals. But Typhon does not ask either.
She doesn't need to. Just by observing, she can tell what the Cyclops had foreseen: they avoided the demons' footsteps, found an underground cave in time to escape the blizzard, and discovered geological structures that could serve as large natural shelters. When Arges's gaze suddenly stopped on the flower blooming suddenly upon the ice, Typhon looked at her expression and thought: this is what she had been searching for. And nobody understands her better.
'Please help me send the flower back to Čappat, to a certain Columbian.' And so, Arges makes a request of her. 'Also, I need to find a group of lost southerners.'
But the scientific expedition team lost in the snowfield never returned to town, and the flower was never delivered.
Typhon's footsteps would finally cease in the course of her most beloved journey. Through the 'flower,' the demons sensed her. The shadow had caught up to her.
And this is where the collapse of all evolution begins.
