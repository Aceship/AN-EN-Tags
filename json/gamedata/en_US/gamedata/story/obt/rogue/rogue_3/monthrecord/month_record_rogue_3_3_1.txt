The old tree had been snapped in half by the time Santalla arrived.
The last time she came, taking Magallan away with her, she knew the building underneath the old tree would be crushed by the snow, and the tree would lose its last support.
But she did not expect it to have become so fragile.
The wind and snow rage. Soon, the branches will be covered up, disappearing completely from sight.
Perhaps it has truly died, this time.
......
It is said that, a long time ago, when this place was still a forest, it was the most visible dead tree in the woods.
No one knows how it died.
Then the snowstorm came, and the forest retreated, but a dead clan tree cannot move.
Thus, one clan split into two. One group migrated to the forest, while the other stayed behind to watch over the old tree.
Santalla chose to stay with the old tree.
She was the tribe's shaman, born to serve the tree.
Few know the reason for her loyalty.
Her life was bestowed to her by the old tree.
It seems strange for the dead to grant life to the living.
But that was the truth.
She was a sickly infant who should have been abandoned.
But the old tree's branches kept her behind.
Coincidence though it may be, the Sami know that everything in nature has meaning. Therefore, they raised the child like any other, and the Snowpriest treated her like a daughter. And Santalla proved worthy.
She had a natural gift: dominion over wind and snow. Without Santalla, her clan would not have been able to stay behind with the tree.
She did all she could to serve her clan tree. Life in the snow was hard but bearable to one whose faith was strong.
Until Ursus slaughtered her people.
