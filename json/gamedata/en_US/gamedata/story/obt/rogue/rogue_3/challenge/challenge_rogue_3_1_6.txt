Guided by the Cyclops, several forest shamans who once safeguarded the tribe are about to head north.
Due to the recent series of strange phenomena, the tribe is in disarray. The well-learned Cyclops intervened just in time to inform them of the danger that lurked in the northern icefields. Meanwhile, the Cyclops promised that through her foresight, she would do her best to bring everyone back safe and sound.
Thus, the tribe held a brief farewell ceremony for the shamans, adorning their staves with branches and leaves from the clan tree.
But what they did not know was that the oracle herself had long been unable to see the true face of fate. She had raised her hand and pointed northward, only to grope around in the darkness in search of a possible path.
