Magallan rummaged through her equipment bag for quite some time, but couldn't find anything that would appeal to a Samifjod. Of course, Columbian gold certificates were right out, and so were experimental materials. And freeze-dried biscuits didn't seem to suit their tastes either. For the first time in Sami, she hadn't prepared very well.
The hunter she was attempting to trade with shakes her head in dissatisfaction. This small group of hunters from outside the tribe were willing to lend aid to people lost in the deep forest, and did not mind escorting the team, even to faraway places, but Magallan is unable to offer them suitable recompense, and therefore has to leave in frustration.
Half a day later, the hunters catch up to her. This time, they have a tall Sarkaz among them.
The hunters inform them that the Cyclops had already traded with them, and paid even for Magallan's share. As such, they now travel together with a common goal.
Magallan looks at the strange Sarkaz with astonishment. She seems to have a pair of eyes that can penetrate people's thoughts. Before Magallan can even voice her doubts, she replies.
'Because I've seen you before.' She answers tragically.
