[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]What would you do with it?
[Dialog(head="char_187_ccheal", delay=1)]I bet Zumama would lose her mind. She could finally afford to pay for parts.
[Dialog(head="char_187_ccheal", delay=0.5)]Me? I'm strong enough already. I don't need cash for anything.
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]I wanna buy new clothes!
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=1)]I... I never thought about it before.
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]There's gotta be something you want to do.
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]At first, I just wanted to be with Gavial forever.
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]And now I want to buy pretty clothes, and do things that make me happy~
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=1)]But...
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0)]But I still want to be together with Gavial!
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=1)]I... I want...

[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]Mm-hm! If there's anything you wanna do, then you can just go and do it~
[Dialog(head="char_187_ccheal", delay=0.5)]Estelle! Look me in the eye! Don't run!
[Dialog(head="char_187_ccheal", delay=0.5)]If you can't figure out what you wanna do, then join Gavial's Trial By Fire!
[Dialog(head="char_187_ccheal", delay=0.5)]Trial 1, Tail Wrestling!
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=1)]Whaâ€”
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=1)]Um, um...! Fear me! Please!
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]Waaah! They're fighting! Gavial's so cool!
