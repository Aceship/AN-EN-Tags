[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=1)]You think anyone'll try to steal all this pure gold from us?
[Dialog(head="char_187_ccheal", delay=0.5)]Who'd have the guts? I'll knock 'em flat.
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=0.5)]Mm-hm! I can knock anyone flat too!
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=0.5)]No one's taking anything from us right now!
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]With those horns, Estelle, you're knocking EVERYONE down!
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]But wow, you're acting a little different from before.
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=0.5)]Um, really?
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]Really!
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]So, how about we head back home together, and hunt for the treasure?
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=0.5)]You mean right now?
[Dialog(head="char_187_ccheal", delay=0.5)]Do we even know it's real?
[Dialog(head="char_187_ccheal", delay=0.5)]Besides, we've got other things to do, right this moment.
[Dialog(head="char_187_ccheal", delay=0.5)]Like, for example, lugging all this pure gold from the factory to the depot.
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]Hneugh!
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=1.5)]Who is it... who's in front of us...?
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=0.5)]Wait! Did someone come to steal our gold?	
[Dialog(head="char_127_estell", delay=0.5)]Haugh! I won't let you anywhere near! Yah!
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]Wait, Estelle!
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]Gavial, hold her down, quick!
[Dialog(head="char_411_tomimi", delay=0.5)]Oh no, Gavial got sent flying!
