[name="???"]  Doctor, we meet again.
[name="???"]  Things are not looking good. Chernobog is about to fall and there's a limit to what I can do from here.
[name="???"]  Right now, we need to restore our infrastructure so that we can provide more support for future operations.

//----------- Building scene ------------

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] In the Base, you can build different facilities to earn resources and manage your Operators.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Since the system was just restored, most facilities will require cleaning before they can be used.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Even though we’ve suffered many losses, our journey has only just begun, and we will rebuild. This place has always been our home through thick and thin.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Before we get started, let me introduce you to some basic functions.

[Tutorial(focusX=-482, focusY=-38, focusWidth=195, focusHeight=41, anchor="TopRight",\
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] \
This number indicates the number of idle drones. Drones are used for tasks such as cleaning up and building rooms. After a drone is used, it will need to be charged and undergo maintenance for a period of time before it can be used again.

[Tutorial(focusX=-286, focusY=-38, focusWidth=195, focusHeight=41, anchor="TopRight",\
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] \
This shows Rhodes Island's power supply. All facilities require electricity, so building and upgrading the power station can provide additional output.

[Tutorial(focusX=-95, focusY=-38, focusWidth=195, focusHeight=41, anchor="TopRight",\
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] \
This displays your currency, Lungmen Dollars (LMD). After all, money doesn’t grow on trees, and most of the materials we produce here are for funding.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Hopefully you’ll be able to digest all this information. After all, this will be the place that you frequent the most.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Don’t worry if this all seems a bit overwhelming at first. Take your time to get acquainted, and slowly help this place become more like the home you’d want.

[Tutorial(target="archi_switch_hotspot", waitForSignal="building_opmode_changed", \
          animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \

That’s why cleaning up these rooms is the first step to starting any job. Let’s switch to <@tu.kw>Building mode</>.

[Building.EnsureOperationMode(mode="ARCHITECTURE")]

          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
The elevator shaft is the passage connecting these various rooms. Tap on the area between these shafts to clean it up.

[Delay(time="$f_delay_single_frame")]

[Tutorial(target="btn_clean_confirm", waitForSignal="building_room_clean_confirmed", searchBtnInChildren=true, \
          animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", importantClick=true, \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] \
Tap here to begin cleaning.
