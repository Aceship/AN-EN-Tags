[Tutorial(target="panel_desc_layout", waitForSignal="equip_show", animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] As you can see here, you may visit the Module system in the bottom right corner of the Operator's interface at any time. You need to unlock the system first, though. You will only be granted access to the system after the Operator fulfills the requirement to obtain <@tu.kw>at least one</> Module.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Here, you can see your Operator's Class Branch's Traits as well as the Module usage status.
