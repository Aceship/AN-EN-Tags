[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Doctor, we may now access our Operators' <@tu.kw>Module</> system. Please follow me. Let's first take a look at the system's basics.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] In general, if an Operator has not yet fulfilled the <@tu.kw>Module</> system unlock requirements PRTS has specified, you will not be allowed to enter the corresponding system.

[Tutorial(target="hide_desc_view",animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Here, you can tap somewhere other than the Module to display Branch and Talent details, allowing you to check on that Operator's specific information. If that Operator has a Module available, you'll also be able to quickly swap the Module from here.
[Tutorial(target="hide_desc_view", animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] However, the Module system must be unlocked first, and an Operator will need to fulfill the conditions for at least one module before gaining authorization to access the system.
[Tutorial(target="uniequip_hot_spot", waitForSignal="equip_edit_show", animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Tap here to edit the Operator's Module.

[Tutorial(target="pool_btn_equip_detail", waitForSignal="equip_unlock_show",            animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Tap here to view or unlock Modules.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Once you have completed all of the Module's <@tu.kw>Designated Missions</>, you will need to consume certain resources before you can actually unlock the Module. Do your best, Doctor.

Here are a few <@tu.kw>Module Data Blocks</> that we prepared for you in advance. They are the key to unlocking the Modules, and they are yours as soon as you are done with this tutorial.
