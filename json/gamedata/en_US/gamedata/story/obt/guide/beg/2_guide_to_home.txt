[name="Dobermann"]   An organization made up of the Infected... I've always thought they were a bit extreme...
[name="Dobermann"]   ...and now they've resorted to violence, and in an Ursus city no less? That's a death wish.
[name="Dobermann"]   The situation is only going to get more chaotic from here on out.
[name="Dobermann"]   Amiya, we need to leave Chernobog right now.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]

[name="Amiya"]   ...I understand.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]   Dr. {@nickname}, I am Dobermann, captain of Op Team E1.
[name="Dobermann"]   We are going to escort you from Chernobog, which is the Ursus city we're currently in, back to Rhodes Island.

[name="Amiya"]   But... since we're cut off from Dr. Kal'tsit, Dobermann and I have lead our separate teams westward to a rendezvous point before confirming our signal to retreat.
[name="Amiya"]   That is, assuming everything goes according to plan.
[name="Dobermann"]    It'd be nice if things went that smoothly.
[name="Dobermann"]    Today is our last opportunity to get you out of here, Dr. {@nickname}.
[name="Dobermann"]    But... I have a bad feeling about this.

[name="Amiya"]   This way, we'll have an edge in battle. 
[name="Amiya"]   It's different from giving verbal commands and might be a bit hard to get used to, but once you learn how to use it, the entire operation will be much smoother.
