[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] If you have already signed contracts with other organizations, this is where you can see what kind of help they might be able to offer.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Depending on how powerful we are and our relationships with these organizations, the help they can provide will also be different.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] They will not support all of our operations, but using them wisely will take the stress off of you a little bit.
