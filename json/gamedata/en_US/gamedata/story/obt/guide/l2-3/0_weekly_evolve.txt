[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Wait, PRTS, hold on! Doctor, you’ll need some special materials before you can promote your Operators!

Tap to enter Skirmishes for gathering Promotion materials.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Material Skirmishes are just like Resource Skirmishes. Come back on another day if the materials you are trying to get are not available.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Each class also requires different materials for Promotion, so plan your Skirmishes accordingly. Remember, promoting your Operators will really help you in the long run.
