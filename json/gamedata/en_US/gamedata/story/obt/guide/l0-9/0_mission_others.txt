[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] In addition to completing Main missions, Side missions and various Daily missions are also important sources of income for Rhodes Island.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Here are the other mission types.
[GotoPage(dest="HOME", waitForSignal="home_routed")]
[Tutorial(target="btn_mission",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Just like the Main mission, other missions can also be found on the <@tu.kw>Missions</> page.
[GotoPage(dest="mission", waitForSignal="mission_routed", initMissionPage="STARTMISSION")]
[Tutorial(target="tab_hotspot_startmission",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] This part has all the <@tu.kw>Starter</> Missions.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] These missions are structured differently than the requests we normally get. They're a series of 'rehabilitation' procedures specifically designed for you.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] Of course, completing these missions will be worth your while, and you will be rewarded with supplies that are hard to come by through most other requests.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] I suggest you prioritize these missions so that you can recall the knowledge you've previously mastered.
