[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] We’ve encountered the Reunion Movement in large-scale battles known as <@tu.kw>Annihilation Operations</>.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Yes, that’s right. If you’re able to perform well in these battles, you’ll be able to greatly reduce the enemy’s operational strength.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Right now, we need you to personally command these important battles.

Annihilation Operations are slightly different from regular battles, so make sure you are familiar with the rules before attempting them.

Doctor, this is very important: you will encounter a large number of enemies in Annihilation stages, but don’t be discouraged if you can’t defeat them all in one try.

[Tutorial(focusX=-97, focusY=-331, focusWidth=103, focusHeight=37, anchor="Right", \

You can also use PRTS to fight for you, and Sanity will be refunded based upon the number of remaining enemies. Please feel free to experiment.

After an Annihilation Operation, rewards will be given based upon the number of enemies defeated.

[Tutorial(target="panel_campaign_info", \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \

The more enemies you defeat, the better your milestone rewards will be. However, each milestone reward can only be collected once.

          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] \
In addition, <@tu.kw>Orundums</> will also be given based on number of enemies defeated during a week. The count is reset weekly and is shared among all Annihilation stages.
