[Tutorial(protectTime=0.8, dialogHead="$avatar_zumama",           dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] It's currently occupied by a group with unknown affiliations, but they'll retreat as soon as we cut off their chain of command.
[Tutorial(protectTime=0.8, dialogHead="$avatar_zumama",           dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] Until our enemies recapture it, we'll be able to send operators on regular expeditions to come here and collect whatever supplies we need.
