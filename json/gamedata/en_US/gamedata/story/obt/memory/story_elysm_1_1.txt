How many years has it been since he left home?
Three? No, he was in Columbia that third year, then went north to Sami.
The Snowpriests stopped him when he tried to go further north, so he changed course and continued on his way.
A healthy man who knows some Arts can always find a job, as long as he's not too picky.
When he ran out of money, he would find work wherever he was and save a bit before heading out again. He has seen many sights along the way.
Some places were rich and prosperous, some poor and barren.
He did not stop at this town because there was something special about it.
He just wanted to rest.

Hard to say. Probably not so much that he should risk his life for it. He's only been there a few months.

And there's no point in thinking about what he can't do.

A panicking mother holds her child tightly in her arms. The elderly sit in a corner, like a row of wrinkled statues.
Elysium can hear the occasional sob. There seems to be fewer people here than he thought there would be. He tries not to think about it.
He looks at the source of the sound. Above them is the door that they came in from. A little bit of dirt drops in with every vibration.
He gets a bad feeling.
The Liberi extends his hand.
Then he stops, stunned.
The door has been blocked by fallen rocks and can no longer be opened.
