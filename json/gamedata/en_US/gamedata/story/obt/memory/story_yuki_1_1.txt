[name="Closure"]  Basically, seeing as this is your first offense, don't you worry that anyone's gonna punish you, or that it'll reflect badly on your Princess.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_118_yuki#4", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  But I don't recommend you try prowling around Rhodes Island like that again.
[name="Closure"]  On the one hand, you'd absolutely, aaaaaabsolutely never get into the core. At least, the pipes won't let you.
[name="Closure"]  But on the other hand, snooping into other people's privacy isn't super cool.
[name="Closure"]  And don't you get tired doing that?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_118_yuki", focus=2)]
[name="ShiraYuki"]  I do not.
[name="ShiraYuki"]  I will not repeat this.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2", name2="char_118_yuki", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  And you're gonna go find some other way instead, aren't you?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2", name2="char_118_yuki#4", focus=2)]
[name="ShiraYuki"]  ...I make no guarantee.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#6", name2="char_118_yuki#4", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  Wowie, do I wanna let Kal'tsit sic you. Loyal people are such a pain in the neck, honestly.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_118_yuki#4", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  But whatever, Kal'tsit wanted me to tell you this instead. 'You may use your methods to observe Rhodes Island, but Rhodes Island is observing you too.'
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_118_yuki", focus=2)]
[name="ShiraYuki"]  ...I understand.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_118_yuki", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  Hey, honestly, if you're so bored at night you wanna roam around, you can come watch these stories with me.
[name="Closure"]  You gave me the impression you've done a little research into them. Most of Rhodes Island are all outdoorsy types, and I'm starving for any compatriots of my own. It's killing me, c'mon.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_118_yuki", focus=2)]
[name="ShiraYuki"]  In continuing to watch this, you will truly find no value.
[name="ShiraYuki"]  I may recommend some. I know not if you possess them.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#5", name2="char_118_yuki", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  Alright, alright!
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#4", name2="char_118_yuki", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  Lay 'em on me, and if I don't have them, I'll go find them for us to watch together!
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#4", name2="char_118_yuki#5", focus=2)]
[name="ShiraYuki"]  ...Very well.
