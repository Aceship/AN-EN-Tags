The Sankta girl stands silently before a tombstone.
She continues playing her cello, each note filled with emotions that Federico cannot feel.
All he can do is sit on the grass not far away, scrawling away and thinking, occasionally lifting his head to look at the tightly-shut windows, the vibrating strings, and the silent tombstones.
He can even discern that the sound of the cello reverberating in the wind is becoming more and more frantic.
