[name="Matterhorn"]Hello. I would like to commission a new shield.
[name="Matterhorn"]This is the one that I've been using. It's gone through a lot of repairs, and it's getting less and less effective in combat. It's time I replaced it.
[Character(name="avg_163_hpsts_1#5$1")]
[name="Vulcan"]This one? I've worked on it many times.
[Character(name="avg_199_yak_1#8$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"]Yes, I brought it with me from Kjerag.
[name="Matterhorn"]It was made with steel that could withstand the extremely low temperatures there.
[Character(name="avg_163_hpsts_1#1$1")]
[name="Vulcan"]Away from Kjerag, however, it no longer performs at the same level.
[Character(name="avg_199_yak_1#8$1")]

[Character(name="avg_199_yak_1#1$1")]

[name="Matterhorn"]I...
[Character(name="avg_199_yak_1#1$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"]This shield was forged by the smiths of House Silverash, passed down to me from my grandfather to my father, both bodyguards to the family.
[name="Matterhorn"]It's a symbol of our vow to give our lives in battle, a vow I took when I received it from my father.
[name="Matterhorn"]It's also a symbol of my duty to protect Lady Ensia, as commanded by my lord.

[name="Matterhorn"]No... Why do you bring her up?
[Character(name="avg_163_hpsts_1#9$1")]
[name="Vulcan"]She's an interesting girl. A little like myself.
[name="Vulcan"]She was born in an old industrial district, and she feels strongly about everything there. She made everything on her herself.
[name="Vulcan"]She liked my machines, but she insists on only using things she's made with her own hands.

[name="Vulcan"]Exactly.
[Character(name="avg_163_hpsts_1#9$1")]
[name="Vulcan"]Is there any point to it? Not really.
[name="Vulcan"]The machines here can create ingots faster than I can. Rockrock understands that what she makes isn't necessarily better than what's available on the market.

[name="Matterhorn"]But you both insist on doing it anyway...
[Character(name="avg_163_hpsts_1#9$1")]
[name="Vulcan"]Yes, because there's meaning behind it. It's part of my roots as a blacksmith.
[name="Vulcan"]Rockrock insists on using what she made herself because, even though she doesn't reject the new, she feels that her roots are still in that old industrial district.
[Character(name="avg_163_hpsts_1#1$1")]
[name="Vulcan"]As for you, no matter how comfortable you are at Rhodes Island, part of you will always be on the snow-covered mountains of Kjerag. You'll always remember the teachings of your father and grandfather.
[name="Vulcan"]I'm asking you, not as a blacksmith but as a friend, to let me continue repairing the shield.
[Character(name="avg_199_yak_1#2$1")]

[name="Vulcan"]Completed deposit and strength testing under different temperatures.
[name="Vulcan"]Layering looks like it can work well. Layering steel with materials that have high tensile strength helps keep the weapon together during impact.
[name="Vulcan"]I need to think about quenching time and temperature, however.
[Character(name="avg_163_hpsts_1#8$1")]
[name="Vulcan"]I tried a partial quenching a couple of days ago, and the metal shattered.

[name="Vulcan"]Yes. I used a new forging method, and found a mineral with the right tensile strength to supplement the steel.
[name="Vulcan"]It's not quite as cold-resistant as the original, but the layered structure allows it to maintain adequate strength even in extreme conditions.
[name="Vulcan"]It's every bit as strong as it was. I didn't do anything with the shape, but I've added some Originium circuits in the back. They're automatically triggered and don't require the user to be skilled with Arts.
