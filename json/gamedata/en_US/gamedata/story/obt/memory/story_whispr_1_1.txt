[name="Lara"]I used to go to the movies with Mommy. The two of us always bought a huge tub of popcorn.

Hurry! The movie's about to start!
Who put this together?
Hm... I can't tell, but Honeyberry's the one who suggested I come.
There were no leaflets or notices, and it seems they put a mini-theater together in the AV room in just one night.
No one's checking tickets at the door either. It's all printed by a self-service ticketing machine.
But if we can print tickets, that's gotta mean we can go in and watch, right? It doesn't say anywhere we can't, right?
I've been curious about this movie for a while now. I've wanted to watch it ever since I read Whisperain's review.
Yeah, me too!

[name="Lara"]It's okay, Doctor. It's a little dark, but I can still see the steps with how high they are!
[name="Lara"]Huh? This place really feels like a movie theater. There are so many people... Is it really okay for me to go inside?
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=1)]
[name="Whisperain"]Don't worry. You've been coming into contact with so many people every day. You won't spread Oripathy to them.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]I'll sit in the front row, then.
[name="Lara"]It's such a big screen... I can see everything so clearly like this.
[name="Lara"]Doctor, you don't have to stay with me if you're busy. I'll find my way back to my room.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=1)]
[name="Whisperain"]No, please. Let me stay and watch the story again.

[name="Honeyberry"]Wow, you're right!
[name="Honeyberry"]Now you two can watch the movie together with no issues!

[name="Honeyberry"]Are you still worried about something?
[name="Honeyberry"]If there's anything on your mind, you can tell me. It doesn't matter if it's happy or sad, it always feels better if you talk to someone about it.
[name="Honeyberry"]Don't worry. I'm a certified counselor. It won't be a burden for me.
[name="Honeyberry"]Besides, how would you know how others will react if you never tell anyone?

[name="Whisperain"]Don't worry about it. It stirs my emotions every time I hear the credits theme.
[name="Whisperain"]There are a lot of different interpretations of the ending. Even I see it differently depending on my mood.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]Then I guess I should see it again when I get older.
[name="Lara"]Thank you for staying with me all this time, Doctor.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=1)]
[name="Whisperain"]Hold on, Lara.
[name="Whisperain"]Sorry, but there's something very important that I haven't told you yet.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]Hm?
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=1)]
[name="Whisperain"]As you've noticed, your vision is deteriorating because of your condition.
[name="Whisperain"]It's under control for the time being, but as long as you have Oripathy, Originium will inevitably eat away at your body.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]So you mean... I won't be able to see anything?
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=1)]
[name="Whisperain"]Right... I can't say for sure when you'll go blind, but it will happen eventually. All too soon.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]Phew...
[name="Lara"]Actually, I kind of figured.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=1)]
[name="Whisperain"]I'm sorry that I've been keeping it from you.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]No worries, Doctor. I've already given it a lot of thought. Actually, I'd even mentally prepared myself for not being able to watch the movie.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]That's why, for the past few days, I've been trying my best to keep my eyes wide open. To remember all the streets, houses, flowers, and grass that I see, how blue the sky is and how white the snow.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]I don't know when Oripathy will make my body hurt again... or when I'll wake up one morning and not be able to see.
[name="Lara"]But until then, I want to try my best to remember everything that I come across.
[name="Lara"]I want to remember everyone that I like too, everyone who takes care of me.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]That way, when I hear their names, I'll remember how they look.
[name="Lara"]So even if things do turn out the way I just said, and I slowly forget everything like my old grandpa who doesn't remember who I am...
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]Even if there comes a day...
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=1)]
[name="Whisperain"]Even if there comes a day I hear a movie's title but don't remember what it means to me.
[name="Whisperain"]Just like the wandering bard who disappears into the rain at the end of the movie. She too once danced in this era's rain.
[name="Whisperain"]Oh, sorry. I finished your sentence again.
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=2)]
[name="Lara"]But that's exactly how I feel.
[name="Lara"]Oh, right, about the ending. Do you think the bard went back in the end? Or do you think she stayed with us?
[Character(name="char_436_whispr",name2="avg_npc_045",focus=1)]
[name="Whisperain"]Well, what I think is...
