[name="Skyfire"]Here's the long and short of it, Professor.
[Character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#7$1")]
[name="Skyfire"]Barum's Works. One of the factories on the list when we put together the investigation into Infected rights.
[name="Skyfire"]I'd consulted you on it, whereupon we decided to send a spy to sniff around in secret. I've assembled a file on the inner workings of his factory.
[name="Skyfire"]On top of which, I find out just a few days ago that this factory's owner was one of my very own classmates.
[Character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#9$1")]
[name="Skyfire"]I initially wanted to send the whole thing up in flames—of course, I knew that was utterly wrong, and it wouldn't solve a single thing, just pile meaningless hassle on instead.
[name="Skyfire"]But I revile, HATE, what he did. Seeking me out at a dinner function hoping for a backdoor into the council, brazenly spilling all about his factory's machinations right in front of a Member—
[name="Skyfire"]His doing so is evidence that dozens upon dozens before him did the same, that countless people took to the same methods for their own underhanded gains.
[Character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#7$1")]
[name="Skyfire"]Professor, it's obviously afoul of current regulations. But they've tried it, and they've found out they don't get punished, they just reap the benefits. That's what got them all to start doing it.
[name="Skyfire"]Truth be told, I do remember him, and I know that 'sat behind me' spiel he gave was <i>true</i> in my case.
[name="Skyfire"]He said the same thing to every noble there, but he did sit in the seat right behind me.
[Character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#9$1")]
[name="Skyfire"]He used to... not <i>be</i> like this.
[Character]
[name="Councilor Angst"]He used to be—a good egg?
[Character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#8$1")]
[name="Skyfire"]Not particularly, but he was hardly what he is now... I just wonder, was this all in his nature? I don't feel like it was, Professor.
[name="Skyfire"]He just... tried slipping through a regulatory loophole, and found nobody even cared. And he just kept inching on and on until he got to this state.
[name="Skyfire"]I...
[Character]
[name="Councilor Angst"]Are you—very conflicted right now, Miss Mountbelan?
[Character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#9$1")]
[name="Skyfire"]No, Professor, I'm not conflicted at all. I just feel a little...
[Character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#7$1")]
[name="Skyfire"]I'm not sure how to put it. But I know crystal clear what I ought to do.
[name="Skyfire"]Anne-Moses, if you could further debrief the Professor on this unscrupulous factory.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223#1")]
[name="Informant"]Yes, Miss Mountbelan.
[name="Informant"]I went into hiding near the factory per the intel Miss Mountbelan provided. My comms signal suffered severe interference whenever I approached its basement levels.
[name="Informant"]I speculate an internal comms shield is installed. The Infected workers within are completely cut off from the outside world.
[name="Informant"]Based on my observations over several days, deceased Infected have even been ported out in secret, and sent for disposal.
[name="Informant"]And armed personnel inside are dedicated to guarding the underground factory and its facilities. The Infected workers above have no inkling of what's going on. They simply assume it must be vital products or something being watched.
[name="Informant"]Based on the data provided by Miss Mountbelan, I surmise it's the previously missing groups of acutely ill Infected workers inside—
[name="Informant"]Being acutely ill makes treatment unnecessary, so they're used as disposable labor, shut in the factory underground to work to their deaths. Then the factory tosses them out, and replenishes with a new batch of Infected workers.
[Character]
[name="Councilor Angst"]Hm... I see the picture now.
[Character]
[name="Councilor Angst"]So, Miss Mountbelan, your method for dealing with this?

[name="Councilors"]Mm, and why did we have to sit here for over ten minutes listening to you talk about this one piffling factory?
[name="Councilors"]This has little bearing on us. I hope you realize that.
[name="Councilors"]Did Councilor Angst really bring you here just to yank this little factory by the collar?
[Character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#9$1")]
[name="Skyfire"]......
[name="Skyfire"]What I wish to point out to you all is that the core of this incident is the missing Infected workers locked away here under armed surveillance, the curtailing of personal freedoms, even the covert disposal of the <i>dead</i>.
[name="Skyfire"]Adding to which, they work in environments of excessive Originium particulate concentration, <i>without</i> corresponding protective measures or communications equipment. Every point here is in violation of currently enacted policy.
[name="Skyfire"]Said enacted policy has led Caladon to be considered relatively relaxed on the Infected, hence why it could even draw such numbers of them to work here. It's the root of the city's development.
[Character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#7$1")]
[name="Skyfire"]Should this incident leak, Caladon's external image will be in smithereens, and no more Infected will think to come here for work, full stop.
