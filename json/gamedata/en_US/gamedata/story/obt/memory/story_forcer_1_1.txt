His work does not stop once, during the course of Ezell's lengthy questioning.
When the watering can is empty, he sets it aside for the time being and starts pruning the overgrown branches and leaves.
Now, he conveniently keeps the shears next to the pruned potted plants.

[name="Medic Operator"]Even though personal conflicts are theoretically forbidden on Rhodes Island, not everyone is so disciplined...
[name="Medic Operator"]If you encounter a situation like that again, do your best to contact the Doctor, Amiya, or Dr. Kal'tsit directly.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Enforcer"]Alright... Uhh, well, I'll see what I can do.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_501_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Medic Operator"]Most importantly...
[name="Medic Operator"]There are a number of Sarkaz operators in Rhodes Island who've had... certain experiences in the past. In your case, it might be extremely dangerous for you to try to approach them.
[name="Medic Operator"]Please be careful.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Enforcer"]Thank you for the advice. I know my conduct carries great risk.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Enforcer"]But, Rhodes Island... is likely the best and most suitable place I'm ever going to find to have these kinds of conversations. Isn't that right?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Enforcer"]Had I met Flamebringer under any other circumstance, I'm afraid I wouldn't be here to tell the tale.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_501_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Medic Operator"]Th-That's true, but...!
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Enforcer"]If I back down now, then the plan to go to Kazdel will fall apart.
[name="Enforcer"]And I can't allow that. It hasn't gotten to the point yet where I have no choice but to give up.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Enforcer"]There's still one more person I should see...

[name="Enforcer"]Excuse me.
[name="Enforcer"]Umm, are you... Mudrock?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]...I am.
[name="Mudrock"]You know me... You came looking for me.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Yes, it may be presumptuous to say this on our first meeting. Nevertheless...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]You're wounded.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#3$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Huh?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]A fresh injury, caused by a sharp object. Just inflicted.
[name="Mudrock"]Did you run into someone on your way here?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#7$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]That would be Flamebringer.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]Yes... Makes sense.
[name="Mudrock"]Even at Rhodes Island, the Sankta are warned not to approach certain people. Some of us are dangerous, including Flamebringer, including myself.
[name="Mudrock"]Didn't the Doctor and Amiya tell you that?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Yeah... The Doctor did try to talk me out of it.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]But you didn't listen.
[name="Mudrock"]I've heard you're gathering information about Kazdel. You're planning to take that girl to find someone.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]That's right. I came to you hoping to get some help...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]I don't understand... Why are you so insistent on going there yourself?
[name="Mudrock"]You want to go to one of the most dangerous places for your kind, just the two of you Sankta... You should know how bad your idea is.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]I promised Cecelia that I'd take her to Kazdel to find her father. And I can't go back on my word.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#4$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]But I'm guessing that explanation won't satisfy you.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]Hmm.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]I suppose it's like... going with the flow, in a way.
[name="Enforcer"]I'm just an ordinary Sankta. If none of that stuff happened, the very idea of ever leaving Laterano probably would've never entered my head.
[name="Enforcer"]I might've just been like everyone else, working and living a stable life, wanting for nothing, never having too many worries on my mind.
[name="Enforcer"]And when I got older, I'd apply for retirement and live the rest of my days in peace and comfort, though it'd probably still get noisy every now and then.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]Sounds like a good life.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#7$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]It is.
[name="Enforcer"]But, when I started to see beyond the walls of Laterano, when I started coming into contact with viewpoints that are at odds with what I know, yet could not be denied...
[name="Enforcer"]Then I, like any ordinary man, could no longer take that life for granted.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#4$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Cecelia gave me a chance. Honestly, I'm the one who needs to thank her.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#8$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Going to Kazdel isn't just a promise I made to her. It's also what I want to do.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]What you want to do?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#7$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Yes.
[name="Enforcer"]I'd love to see Kazdel for myself, and witness the lives of the people there.
[name="Enforcer"]That's the reason why I've come to you, Mudrock, ma'am.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#5$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]I... want to understand the Sarkaz, the people we've been locked in conflict with forever. I want to know... are we actually the same?
[name="Enforcer"]If we were born the same, what is it that divides us now?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]......
[name="Mudrock"]What is your plan?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Ahaha... As much as I'd love to say that I've already devised a plan to do all that...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#4$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]The truth is, I'm having a hard time even gathering info...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]*sigh*...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]That said, it's not like I haven't given it any thought at all. I just wouldn't call it a fully-fledged plan.
[name="Enforcer"]In the case of Cecelia and myself, Kazdel is indeed difficult to enter, and us being Sankta only puts us on the back foot even more...
[name="Enforcer"]But, if we're talking about a mercenary who made it out of Kazdel...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]What do you mean...?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]For example, a mercenary who was born in Kazdel, someone like you.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#8$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Say she went abroad to earn some money before going back home, and captured two Sankta prisoners along the way. That sounds pretty reasonable, doesn't it?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#4$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Haha... Just an idea that popped into my head, Mudrock. Don't worry too much about it.
[name="Enforcer"]It was only after meeting Flamebringer that I realized I haven't been taking this whole thing seriously enough.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]It sounds reasonable.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#3$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Huh?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_942_1#1$1")]
[name="Mudrock"]If you make up your mind and decide to take the risk...
[name="Mudrock"]Your idea is reasonable and might be worth a shot.
[name="Mudrock"]Do you have the courage to try?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#1$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]...Of course.
[name="Enforcer"]If I was afraid of taking risks, I never would've left Laterano.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4036_forcer_1#4$1")]
[name="Enforcer"]Mudrock... Ma'am, can I ask you to help with this?
