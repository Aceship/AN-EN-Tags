[name="Field Operator"]S-Santalla!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#7$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Wh-What's wrong? Why are you so nervous?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]You've been gone for so long! Any longer and I would've reported to the landship that you went MIA!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Am I not back now?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]I know you're dealing with a lot of things. But next time, please help me prepare myself, mentally. What would we do if you disappeared one day?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Okay, it's my fault, I'm sorry Faye.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]Don't think you can get out of this with just an apology...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#12$1")]
[name="Santalla"]I'll make you some roasted hornbeast, alright?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]Roasted hornbeast?!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#12$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Are we settled, then?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]Hmph... Seeing how you're being so sincere, I'll overlook it just this once.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#13$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Thank you, Faye, you're a true friend.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]F-Flattery will get you nowhere.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#13$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Hehe.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#12$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Ah right, has the expedition team returned yet?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]Ah... Of course, no one told you.
[name="Field Operator"]The expedition team ran into some trouble before entering the icefields. Some sort of horrible monster, like the ghost of an Ursus officer or something.
[name="Field Operator"]Luckily, Typhon was prepared, and everyone withdrew in time. Otherwise there would be casualties. Which, well, would be hard to explain.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]I see, that's good to hear.
[name="Santalla"]What about the clans who migrated south?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]They found a place to settle down. The Infected, if they so wish, can still live with their clan and visit Rhode's Island's Sami clinic for treatment.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#12$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Oh, that's good.
[name="Santalla"]Then I have nothing to worry about.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]Ah, Santalla, where are you heading this time?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#12$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Just back to the dorms to take a nap.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]Oh, so even you know how to rest. Finally.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Then tomorrow we'll visit Skarphaket and meet up with Magallan and Typhon.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]I take it back, you're unstoppable.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#12$1")]
[name="Santalla"]This is what every Sami shaman... what every Rhodes Island operator should be doing, no more and no less.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]If I worked as hard as you, I'd be sent to Medical within a month.
[name="Field Operator"]I know this work is important, but that's all the more reason to balance it out with proper rest.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#13$1")]
[name="Santalla"]And to me, taking a nap here is proper enough.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]That's not going to cut it, you really need get some sleep.
[name="Field Operator"]We can save the rest for tomorrow.
[name="Field Operator"]Now go on, go.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Ah...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#12$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Fine, fine, I'll rest.
[name="Santalla"]Thank you, Faye.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_088",focus="m")]
[name="Field Operator"]Sweet dreams, Santalla.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_341_sntlla_1#13$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Yes, goodnight.
