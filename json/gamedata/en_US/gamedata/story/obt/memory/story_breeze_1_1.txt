[name="Grace"]An omnivorous beast! The teeth are in fairly shabby shape. But its claws are sharp; chances are, it tears its prey to slivers before it eats.

[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]So it was you, Rita. Get over here, quickly.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Grace, Grace!! There was rustling in those bushes over there!! It's a beast! Is this where we're going to die?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Hahaha! Don't lose your head, I made all that up on the spot.
[name="Grace"]I was just curious who was creeping around behind me, and here you are.

[name="Rita"]Come on, Grace, don't scare me like that!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Well, I might've made up the beasts, but people who secretly follow you are plenty dangerous too.
[name="Grace"]Now, confess. Why are you tracking me?
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]......
[name="Rita"]I—I was hungry.
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]You were hungry, so you followed me looking for food? I don't know, you seem pretty chipper to me, don't you?
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Mama and Papa don't have anything to eat. They gave their last bit of food to me...
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]......
[name="Grace"]How about the harvest group's food?
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Mama got ill forever ago. After Papa got hurt hunting, the harvest group all said our family doesn't work for anything, and they don't want to give us food...
[name="Rita"]And they said, it's winter now, and they can barely find any food like this. There's not enough stores in camp, and unless it gets warmer, we'll be more and more short on food.
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"](That's true enough. The situation's continued to deteriorate.)
[name="Grace"](If help still doesn't show up, then when the time comes...)
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]And... even if I went with them, I don't have any contribution to make to the hunt. They just won't share anything with me. So the last few days, I haven't gone with them...
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Is that how they're going to be now?!
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]*whimper*... Both Mama and Papa are sleeping on sickbeds, and it's cold, and I can't eat enough to not be hungry. I don't feel good.
[name="Rita"]Grace, can you help tell me which things are edible? I want to pick some stuff before I go back...
[name="Rita"]Even just some weeds would be okay. It doesn't matter how bad it tastes, either. As long as I can feel fuller, it's fine!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]......
[name="Grace"]No problem, leave it to me! But just eating weeds you find on the wayside won't do it. If you really want to be full, you'll want beast meat too.
[name="Grace"]The food you ultimately get from scrabbling around here won't be enough in the long-term, versus the effort you spend.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]But I—I can't catch beasts.
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Mmm... leave that for today, then. Emergencies first. Tomorrow, I'll take you up north, and we'll see if we can't catch a few little beasties for ourselves!
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Really? Thank you, Grace!
[name="Rita"]This is great! Mama and Papa can eat properly too!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Save your thanks just for now. In exchange, listen to what I say today, and don't go scarpering off, got it?
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Got it!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Oh, careful where you're stepping! Don't you trip over.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Hehe...
[name="Rita"]Are we looking for herbs we can eat now? Mama and Papa are waiting for me to bring back food!
[name="Rita"]Ah, this one looks like a herb! Grace, is this one edible?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Hm... it might look very much like you could eat it, but it's actually poisonous.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Um, then what about this one here?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Not that one either. It's too tough to chew, and you'll make your mouth bleed.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Then this one! It's a fruit! It's fresh, too. Is this one okay?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]This is a cysteye. A berry that looks just like a cystybeast's eye, right?
[name="Grace"]But it's not edible. It looks plenty delicious, and it's sweet if you try it too. But, afterwards, it'll give you tremendous tummy problems, and the more you eat, the worse it'll get.
[name="Grace"]Some Victorian nobles use them as weight-loss drugs, run themselves dry eating them, then their lowered immunity leads to all sorts of illness... no matter if it fills you, it's awful for the human body.
[name="Grace"]Giving other species the runs to spread its own seeds. Evolution truly goes in funny ways, sometimes.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]*whimper*—What do we do then?! We can't find anything to eat at all.
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Don't lose heart. The fruit might not be edible, but you can eat its leaves. They're a little bitter, but won't do any damage to the body. Boiling them will help take some of the edge off.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Then I'll pick just a few leaves to try.
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Heheh, I'll say your luck's not too bad! Look at what I'm holding—you can go find a few of these too.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Are those pebbles?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Look on top of them. These are wild mossoats—these spores here look just like oats, that's why. You can eat these.
[name="Grace"]The books said some of Ursus's farming peasantry in the Northern Tundra grow these, but I never imagined we'd find some here too.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]That's superb! I'll go pick some too!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]The more, the better. Pull off the husks, wash them, and you can boil them for a thin porridge.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]But if we pick them all now, won't there be no more left later?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]The mossoat harvest cycle goes by in a flash. After the harvest period, its sugar content gets absorbed, the spores on top are formed, the 'oat' part of it withers some, and it turns bitter and inedible.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Then are these ones right now good mossoats?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]They are! You've got sound luck, Rita! But these are wild ones after all—they won't be plenty. You'll want to pick all of these to have enough for a full pot.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]I'll go for it, then!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Incredible stuff, Rita. I'll help you out too.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Thank you, Grace! Hehe, I'm gonna pick loads, and then I'll hide them all, and only give them to Mama and Papa!
[name="Rita"]Once I pick all the mossoats, I'll come pick the medicine herbs with you, Grace!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Perfect. You look around this flat area, then, and don't go too far. I'll see what's westwards. If anything happens, just shout for me!
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Mm-hm! I got it, Grace!

[name="Grace"]Alright, I'm done picking on you. Anyhow, what have you been doing down here?
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]I couldn't find more mossoats up above, so I went to see if there were any underground, so I could pick even more.
[name="Rita"]And then I wasn't careful and I fell!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Are you hurt?
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]I landed on my butt a little hard, but everything else is okay.
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Phew. Thank goodness for that.
[name="Grace"]Weren't you supposed to be listening to me? I never told you to come anywhere like this, did I?
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]But I only have enough for one pot, and it's not that much. Besides, if we went harvesting tomorrow and it was too late, wouldn't they all be wasted?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]You still have to mind your own safety, though.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Mm-hm... I left my basket up above, so it's alright!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]I saw it just now. Which is why I left my basket there too.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Next to mine?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Yep, all snuggly.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Hehehe, that's really nice.
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]It's raining now. Here, put this on you. Don't catch a cold now.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]This leaf is huge!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]I picked it just before. Wear it on your head, put your horns through these two holes, and that'll block the rain.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]My ears are chilly. I feel a little bad.
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Don't you take it off. The rain'll love to give you a cold if it soaks you. If you get ill too, who's going to care for your mum and dad?
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]That's right, I'm our provider now! I have to make sure Mama and Papa are well-fed!
[name="Rita"]Hmm?
[name="Rita"]Grace, aren't you gonna put on a leaf?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]You wear yours for now.
[name="Grace"]I've actually barely ever gotten rain-soaked. Feels a little unlike anything else.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]How come—how come you never got wet in the rain before?
[name="Rita"]Maybe Victoria doesn't get that much rain, actually?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Rain's a very common sight in Victoria, to be clear, but it's true—I've never been able to shower in it.
[name="Grace"]Especially like now. Nothing between me and the final rains of autumn, pattering on my head...
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Then I'm even stronger than you are! When it's raining, I fetch laundry outside all the time, and do farm work.
[name="Rita"]Rain is pretty much like when the village headman got mad at me. He went, Rita, pbphth, whatbth is phthe meaning of thisph thbphruckus—!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Hahahaha! Oh, that headman. Just like a spit sprinkler when worked up.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]But he can't sprinkle anymore now...
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]He'd just gotten too old. Too tired, too.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]I saw it. That day I secretly followed you, and saw you carrying him out on your back, and you were really struggling to take him so far away, and then soon after you put him down, he just...
[name="Rita"]Just floated away like ash, like when we burn wood...
[name="Rita"]Will my Mama and Papa become like that too?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]......
[name="Grace"]It's been two weeks already since the distress team left. Given they're following my map, they should've found a nearby town by now.
[name="Grace"]Besides, I've picked so much medicine today, and you've picked plenty of food too. Your mum and dad will be just fine!
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Right! I've worked really hard! Mama and Papa are gonna be better for sure!
[name="Rita"]By the way, Grace, why don't you let anyone else help you pick medicine?
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Mm... you know, everyone's in the same boat as your family. They can't eat their fill now, so securing food is more or less top priority for them all.
[name="Grace"]That's why nobody has a hand to lend, see.
[name="Grace"]The rain's getting stronger, it looks like. Your mum and dad will be worried about you. Head on back first, okay? I can find the rest of the herbs we need by myself.
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Mm-hm! I need to bring back everything I picked. I bet Mama and Papa are just as hungry.
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Can you still tell the way back?
[character(name="char_empty")]
[name="Rita"]Of course I can!
[character(name="avg_275_breeze_1")]
[name="Grace"]Then I'll lift you up out of here. Careful, now.

[name="Grace"]I just saw the herbs I needed on the cliff over there.
[name="Grace"]The rain's not going to make this tunnel hard for me, but am I still going to make it up that cliff?
[name="Grace"]Yowch, I must've gashed that ankle when I fell down. The wound's fairly big. Need something to stop the bleeding first.
[name="Grace"]But I'm not going to win at any gymnastics once I'm bound up. That makes the cliff even harder.
[name="Grace"]*hiss*! God, my ankle hurts... I'm feeling a little dizzy too. Have I gotten fatigued lately?
[name="Grace"]Rita's mum's in terrible shape. Her dad's suffered external wounds, and I gave first-aid treatment, but it's still at risk of infection.
[name="Grace"]The nobles couldn't have possibly missed refugees entering their estate, so why are they so unconcerned... not even just to deport them... why haven't they shown up?
[name="Grace"]The refugees long since ran out of pharmaceuticals, and now all they have is plant remedies for simple treatment. I need to pick more. I need to be able to help more!
[name="Grace"]I hope to heaven we can last until the distress team comes back with someone. I hope to heaven...
[name="Grace"]Ah, I can't get bogged down in this. If I let the rain get any worse, that cliff'll only be harder! I need to hurry and pick what I need! I'll bandage myself after I'm back down!

[name="Grace"]Rita...
[name="Grace"]Rita... Rita... you have to...
[name="Warm Voice"]She was like this when we found her, mumbling the name over and over.
[name="Warm Voice"]She's covered in mud, her ankle is injured, and she has minor Oripathy infection symptoms. Was she only recently infected?
[name="Warm Voice"]Oripathy infection is only one part of it. The major contributing factors to her fainting were starvation and extreme exhaustion.
[name="Warm Voice"]Reports say she's been passed out for several days now. Some refugees say this young woman was protecting them. Without her efforts, hardly this many would have survived.
[name="Warm Voice"]The refugees regained capacity for labor after recovering, and were able to request treatment and a place to stay from Mr. Gurk of Leithanien. He required people to staff and safeguard that bizarre castle of his.
[name="Warm Voice"]These people's home was struck by severe Catastrophe. Going back seems unlikely at present, so most refugees have accepted this proposal. They're prepared to undergo treatment at Mr. Gurk's, and to wait for now to see if they should return home.
[name="Warm Voice"]Only the reasonable grounds of allowing these refugees to return to their home country could convince any related nobles not to interfere.
[name="Warm Voice"]About the young girl named Rita. Her mother has already passed on. Fortunately, her handicapped father is still able to work.
[name="Warm Voice"]A Catastrophe Messenger in the vicinity mentioned Earthspirit on the Rhodes Island landship is an old acquaintance of Gurk's. I'll write her a letter asking for a favor, to see if this father and daughter can be admitted onto his estate.
[name="Razor-like Voice"]The young Vulpo lady was unorthodox enough to leave deep impressions on people, but plucking herbal medicine and understanding some clinical theory was all she had. No way of suppressing her own Oripathy.
[name="Razor-like Voice"]She's too simple about the task of aiding refugees. It would've cost her her life sooner or later if she was too reductive about it.
[name="Razor-like Voice"]In a moment, I want you to make contact with a nearby Messenger. There's two letters I want to send. One to Rhodes Island, and another to a place in Toron.
[name="Warm Voice"]......
[name="Warm Voice"]I'm compelled to remind you, Victoria has nobles who want those refugees dead here to serve their vie over territory. So as to keep our motive secure, we cannot at this moment openly represent Rhodes Island.

[name="Warm Voice"]Not to mention you slipped out of a Victorian medical seminar to come here. Your actions must be kept subdued. It'll be best you don't give even more issues the chance to form.
[name="Razor-like Voice"]Oh, I was in an academic seminar, huh. See, these past few days, I was under the impression I'd be participating in some wannabe Durins' wine-tasting.
[name="Razor-like Voice"]Heh. To some nobles, philanthropy is a trend, and a trend is as far as it goes. They weighed the pros and cons, and did something anyone could've seen coming from a mile off.
[name="Warm Voice"]She's too weak. If we don't immediately treat her, further illness will seize hold of her, and we'll see her Oripathy infection accelerate.
[name="Razor-like Voice"]Let her pass off as my assistant and get the best treatment Victoria has to offer.
[name="Razor-like Voice"]Yeah, no kidding, we're gonna keep our true identities a secret from her. You happy with that?
[name="Warm Voice"]Assistant? Why do I suspect you're thinking of having her by your side?
[name="Razor-like Voice"]I'm no nanny. You ever seen me drop in from the Victorian skies on an umbrella?
[name="Razor-like Voice"]Once she recovers, I'll contact a specialist place and get her on a course for medical Arts, and I've got other fish to fry in the meanwhile.
[name="Razor-like Voice"]If she wants to keep up her innocent little savior business, I'm not gonna write in to complain.
[name="Razor-like Voice"]But as a doctor with Oripathy, she's got no choice. She can't keep playing the wild maverick forever. Bottom line, she needs to learn how to protect herself. How her own future spirals out is her business.
[name="Warm Voice"]Suit yourself. *sigh*. I suppose once Scout's done with his mission, I'll be transferring to his squad anyway. Having a Victorian local by your side to keep an eye on you works out.
[name="Warm Voice"]I weep for that Vulpo...
[name="Razor-like Voice"]She's sure as hell a lot more confident than you when she treats people.
[name="Warm Voice"]Hm. And her prescriptions when treating non-Oripathy patients are particularly effective.
[name="Warm Voice"]......
[name="Warm Voice"]I think I see what it is.
[name="Warm Voice"]Kindness, strength, honesty, a tender age yet already at such standards.
[name="Warm Voice"]You want to defend a possibility.
