Other people always say you become numb after working for too long. They say this is true for everything else as well, that everything becomes normal once you've been through it enough.
But when I go back and forth between the mountains and the cities, what I deliver most is letters back home.

I know that on the other side of this mountain lies more mountains, and that when the convoy from Shiqiao sets out, they'll at best meet me head-on. But, I can't slow down.
It feels as if I'm rushing to meet the last of my neighbors who still haven't moved.
If I arrive earlier, we'll be able to sit down together for a chat over a cup of tea. Any later, and I'll only be able to catch the sight of their backs.

When I get to the end of the letter, I have to grit my teeth to keep myself from crying. But, the old woman simply turns around, slowly making her way to the backyard.
There is already a carefully tended tree in the center of the courtyard, covered with jujubes both green and red.
The old woman slaps her palm down between the branches and leaves of the jujube tree, and the sharp thorns dig into her hand. Tears crawl down her wrinkled face.
After a moment of silence, she turns around and heads in the direction of the convoy.
