Honeyberry feels a lump in her throat and could say no more.
Martenson's attitude is harsh and stern, but Honeyberry sees only fear in his eyes.
The same fear that they had cast towards her family.
She looks around at Samantha, at the others, and sees the same in their eyes.

Dear Zoey,
How are you doing?
Carl and I both applied to the mining company. Guess who got hired?
Both of us! I couldn't believe it!
We celebrated by having a nice meal out. Carl chose a Siracusan restaurant, and it was really good. We'll take you there next time you're here.
We both went through the entrance physical, and showed no trace of Oripathy. I've fully recovered from my symptoms too.
Thank you so much for your help.
Give your mum my regards!
Your dearest Lydia
P.S.: Carl's dad came to see him and brought him some food from home.
He said that the arguments went on for days after the Rhodes Island operators brought the Oripathy screening equipment and trained people how to use it.
In the end, they're letting the Infected and their families live near the village. They don't have to stay in the forest anymore.
He asked whether we wanted to go back, but Carl turned him down.
Even if Carl said yes, though, I wouldn't go back. I won't ever go back.
[Character(name="avg_449_glider_1#13$1")]
[name="Honeyberry"]......
[name="Honeyberry"]I guess I don't have to go back anymore.
[Character(name="avg_449_glider_1#14$1")]
[name="Honeyberry"]They've taken the first step. They'll put their prejudices aside.
[name="Honeyberry"]They will.
