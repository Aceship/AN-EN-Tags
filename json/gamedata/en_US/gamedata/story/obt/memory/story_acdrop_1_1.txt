[name="Staff Worker"]Thank you very much, Miss.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]
[name="Aciddrop"]So what's the deal?
[Character(name="avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Staff Worker"]We've unanimously agreed that you're the strongest contestant in the graffiti art competition...
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]
[name="Aciddrop"]No need to butter me up. I know exactly what I'm worth.
[Character(name="avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Staff Worker"]I'll cut to the chase then. Just give me a nod, and we'll make sure you're crowned winner.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]
[name="Aciddrop"]Just a nod? That easy?
[Character(name="avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Staff Worker"]Hear me out first. The champion not only earns more prize money, but also gets to automatically become the first president of the city's Graffiti Art Association—
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]
[name="Aciddrop"]Perfect, I've been wondering about that. So, what exactly are all these associations, and what are they for?
[Character(name="avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Staff Worker"]Naturally, to bring street culture to more people, have more youth participate, and have older folks gain a greater appreciation for it as well.
[name="Staff Worker"]Take the graffiti art you love so much. After the association is established, it will become a legal government entity, and its members will be protected under the law to freely express their ideas in a reasonable manner.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]
[name="Aciddrop"]Even if that expression takes place on someone else's property?
[Character(name="avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Staff Worker"]The association will have a designated venue for its activities.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]
[name="Aciddrop"]Okay, say I'm falsely accused of shoplifting by some store, and their surveillance cameras just happened to be down...
[Character(name="avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Staff Worker"]That has nothing to do with what we're talking about—
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]
[name="Aciddrop"]...I can only spray what was meant for the wall of that shop in that 'designated venue,' right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Staff Worker"]......
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]
[name="Aciddrop"]Sounds like I hit the nail on the head.
[name="Aciddrop"]So I can only express my anger 'in a reasonable manner' in that 'clean and tidy' 'designated venue' that even the shop owner would feel dirty stepping in.
[Character(name="avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Staff Worker"]Once it is formed, the first legal venue for the association will be the white walls of City Hall. There's no way your hypothetical shopkeeper would miss it.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]
[name="Aciddrop"]...Is that so?
[name="Aciddrop"]And will the gentlemen in City Hall allow what's on that wall to go against them?
[Character(name="avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Staff Worker"]There's no need to be so cynical, Miss Aciddrop—
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]
[name="Aciddrop"]After seeing your Parkour Association president today, how can I not be?
[Character(name="avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Staff Worker"]...Is this really the hill you want to die on?
[name="Staff Worker"]If you're going to maintain that position, I'd recommend withdrawing from the competition, so as not to make both sides look bad.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]

Aciddrop pokes her head out from behind the alley.
She sees that the graffiti she sprayed on the wall last night had gained a few friends, presumably added by people after her.
The policeman from last night, as well as someone she didn't recognize, are pouring water on it.
Splash.
Aciddrop rubs her eyes.
Splash.
Two buckets of cold water in, and everything she'd sprayed had become a cloud of muddy water.
The policeman takes out a colorful rag from another bucket and wipes it along the wall a couple times. The wall's original off-white color quickly reveals itself, with no trace of the graffiti left behind.

[name="Stranger"]And after that association is established, they'll all come here like obedient little lapbeasts and get it out of their system. After all, who in Columbia wouldn't want the backing of the law?
[name="Stranger"]Then all we'll have to do is check the surveillance footage every day—camera should be coming in tomorrow—and find out who's complaining about what they shouldn't be.
[name="Stranger"]Then I clean it up, and you bring the bastards in to show 'em their place.

[name="Police Officer"]I'd bring them to the wall they vandalized and make them scrape it clean and paint it over. They'd learn the price of being a public nuisance through hard work and elbow grease.
[name="Police Officer"]But now... how am I supposed to explain that they're being brought in for not doing 'legal graffiti'?
[name="Police Officer"]Not only that, even if it <i>is</i> 'legal,' there's no guarantee they won't be brought in anyway.
