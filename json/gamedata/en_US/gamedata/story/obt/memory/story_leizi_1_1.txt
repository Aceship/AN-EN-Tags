[name="Lin Qingyan"]I've said this many times as well. Deputy Minister Lin Qingyan merely does what the Deputy Minister of the Central Judicial Office Assistant must.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Ten years ago, when Deputy Minister Yu inspected the nation's many prisons, he passed by Langyi and indicted the local magistrate. After a year and three months, the magistrate died in prison.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]And I discovered certain discrepancies while going over the literature.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Three months ago, I visited Langyi and looked into the matter... The key evidence that Deputy Minister Yu used during the impeachment, such as the account book and directory of personnel were all indeed fabricated.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]The evidence I have gathered is conclusive, irrefutable.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_041",focus="r")]

[name="Jie Zhen"]Is it not also indisputable, nay, irrefutable that he repeatedly misused his position and issued local decrees to levy new taxes?
[name="Jie Zhen"]How long did he block the appeals of subjects demanding redress for their injustices, bribe government inspectors and officials, falsify the sentiment of the populace in his reports to the capital, causing immeasurable harm?
[name="Jie Zhen"]......

The three turn at the hillside corner, abruptly opening up their view.
Taihe and Jie Zhen follow Lin Qingyan's gaze. A bottomless cliff and a cloud haze block the way forward, but a lone, thin pine tree stands tall, tainting its surroundings with a jade color that cannot be hidden by the snow.

[name="Taihe"]I see.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_039_1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]At the time, Deputy Minister Yu was still young and inexperienced. He climbed high and looked far ahead to see nothing but clouds and mist. Suddenly, the sunlight broke through, dispersing the gloom, shining clear on heaven and earth...
[name="Lin Qingyan"]He thought of how he was to enter the capital, to take up his post at the Central Judicial Office. He was filled with a mix of emotions.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]He vowed to uphold justice for the people, to become the last line of defense for the laws of Yan, to ensure that none would be wronged. Thus, he planted a pine sapling to symbolize his determination.

[name="Taihe"]Our good Deputy Minister Yu!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_039_1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Good indeed. The sapling has now grown into a tall, upright tree. Likewise, my predecessor has lived up to his aspirations from when it was planted.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Yu Cheng is the most outstanding Deputy Minister the Central Judicial Office has had. He made countless fair judgments, and the case of Langyi's magistrate is not the most difficult he has adjudicated.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]He erred only this once. But he did err this once.

[name="Taihe"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_041",focus="m")]

[name="Jie Zhen"]Anyone who climbs so far to be faced with such a tree, standing tall, reaching for the clouds, enduring storm and wind unbreaking, would find his heart invigorated.
[name="Jie Zhen"]Deputy Minister Lin Qingyan, were this tree toppled, to what degree would the enthusiasm of those climbers be dampened?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_039_1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_040",focus="m")]
[name="Taihe"]It seems Monitor Censor Jie Zhen has a point to make.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_041",focus="m")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]I wish to suppress this case, not only to protect Yu Cheng.
[name="Jie Zhen"]Deputy Minister Qingyan, having just taken a post at the Central Judicial Office barely one year ago, has thoroughly examined all documents pertaining to the former Deputy Minister. Following his retirement, the former Deputy Minister was recalled and convicted.
[name="Jie Zhen"]Does this not suggest that the next Deputy Minister of the Central Judicial Office should investigate you upon his appointment?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_040",focus="m")]
[name="Taihe"]Deputy Minister Qingyan happened to come across the relevant records during routine archival work...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_041",focus="m")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]Indeed. But what difference does that make?
[name="Jie Zhen"]You and I both know that even the purest, most innocent soul cannot withstand investigation. Particularly in matters concerning civil service.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_041",focus="m")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]Think about it. If we establish this precedent, officials of all rank will stand on edge, acting only out of concern over future investigation. It will hinder the execution of their duties.
[name="Jie Zhen"]The slightest indication that one may have lost his way becomes a vulnerability. Whether colleagues or successors, one never knows when ill intention may uncover something, with imprisonment the end result.
[name="Jie Zhen"]If we continue down this path, would anyone dare make progress during their tenure?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_039_1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_041",focus="m")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]Deputy Minister Qingyan, the Three Organs of Justice are not the Tianshi Bureau. We have more to weigh than righteousness alone.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_039_1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Jie Zhen, why do you change the subject?
[name="Lin Qingyan"]As the Deputy Minister of the Central Judicial Office, you have chosen to describe the act of forging evidence as merely 'losing one's way'?

[name="Jie Zhen"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_039_1",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_041",focus="m")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]Oh?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_039_1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]You would take no action and call it an act of preservation?
[name="Lin Qingyan"]In my early years studying Lei Fa, the Tianshi instructed me: 'One who controls lighting must first respect its power, lest one come to harm oneself.'
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Among the Three Organs of Justice, the Department of Discipline and Supervision oversees the civil service, while the Central Judicial Office reviews criminal cases. Behind every official and every case, there must be a pair of watchful eyes and a final checkpoint.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]And so do we require a Censorate to censure the Censors? Another pair of eyes behind us? There is no perfect system under Heaven, and it is not possible to keep infinitely layering inspectors.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]And so the ones we must be inspecting first and foremost are ourselves. Otherwise, how are we to ensure that the law truly protects all the subjects of Great Yan?
[name="Lin Qingyan"]We all serve the Three Organs of Justice. You may not be unaware of this principle!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_041",focus="m")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]Does the law not allow for compassion?
[name="Jie Zhen"]Is it you who is truly ruthless, or is it the law of Yan?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_039_1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]If those who enforce the law are not bound by the law, then what is the use of establishing the law?

[name="Taihe"]Calm yourselves, please...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_039_1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]I must see this case through. And not only to dispose of Yu Cheng.

[name="Jie Zhen"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_039_1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Back in Langyi, Deputy Minister Yu lost his way and resorted to half measures when faced with a corrupt but cunning magistrate. In pursuit of justice, this seems somewhat understandable.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Were it you or I, we may have made the same choice.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]But what if the future brought us a more ambiguous case? What if, in the future, we found ourselves with ill intent?
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Would it be easier to lose our way and resort to such measures in order to seize a good man in place of a bad one?
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Indeed, it would make the execution of ill intent that much simpler.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]The law of the land decides life and death. In the fulfillment of our duties, we may tolerate neither error nor deviation.
