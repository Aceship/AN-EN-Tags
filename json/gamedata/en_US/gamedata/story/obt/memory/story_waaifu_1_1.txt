[name="Huai Tianpei"]What a joke.
[name="Huai Tianpei"]How vast do you think the land is? Just because I pass through a few cities with no opponent, I can pretend I'm number one?
[name="Waai Fu"]But you've trained so hard, and you look for opponents everywhere. So why?
[name="Huai Tianpei"]Training is training. Why all the 'why?'
[name="Huai Tianpei"]All I'm doing is seeking the masters, finding the peaks. Only by witnessing the heights of the sky and the breadths of the land can I know where I stand, can I go further!

[name="Waai Fu"]Martial arts are like a mirror, they reflect your own will, your own state of mind. Practicing them is recognizing yourself. It's that one, 'with no purpose and no self, there is no boundary and no end'.
