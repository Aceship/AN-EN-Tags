[Character(name="avg_489_serum_1#9$1")]
[name="Corroserum"]Is there an issue?
[Character(name="avg_npc_222")]
[name="Customer Representative"]So here's the situation. We've been... having a number of internal reorganizations lately. A lot has changed.
[name="Customer Representative"]The new manager proposed a new target policy, and was dissatisfied with the performance of the current corrosive agent. He would like you to meet the following benchmarks.

[name="Corroserum"]A corrosion index requirement as high as this... practically falls under the category of a WMD.
[Character(name="avg_npc_222")]
[name="Customer Representative"]It's... for personal protective use.
[name="Customer Representative"]Also, for whatever reason, the budget for this project has been slashed.
[name="Customer Representative"]Therefore, you might encounter some difficulties in terms of controlling costs and future development expenses. I hope you understand.
[Character(name="avg_489_serum_1#2$1")]
[name="Corroserum"]Sorry, but allow me to say something.
[name="Corroserum"]First of all, I can't guarantee that we can meet these new benchmarks. It's something I'd have to discuss with my teammates first.
[name="Corroserum"]Second, an extended R&D cycle would inevitably lead to an increase in development costs. If you're going to cut the budget...
[Character(name="avg_npc_222")]
[name="Customer Representative"]Um... In that case, how about removing some of the unnecessary protective systems? Just leave in the basic safety features.
[Character(name="avg_489_serum_1#2$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_222")]

[name="Customer Representative"]Which is why I think of these as hurdles we can overcome together. ...We are, of course, very sorry for the trouble.
