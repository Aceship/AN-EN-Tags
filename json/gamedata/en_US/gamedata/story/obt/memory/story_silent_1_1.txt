[name="Silence"]The next time we go out together, I'm insisting that we go see the fountain in Trimounts Common.

[name="Joyce"]Do you like the fountain in Trimounts Common?
[character(name="avg_108_silent_1#2$1",name2="avg_128_plosis_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Yes, it reminds me of a little park back home. There was an identical fountain there, just a little smaller.
[character(name="avg_108_silent_1#2$1",name2="avg_128_plosis_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Joyce"]The fountain of Trimounts Common is known for its exotic design. It is possible that both fountains were built by Trimounts' Munson Inc.

[name="Silence"]Ha. I thought it was a fun coincidence, but I guess it's just Munson Inc. expanding its business into rural areas.

[name="Silence"]It's hard to know what to say, when you ask like that.
