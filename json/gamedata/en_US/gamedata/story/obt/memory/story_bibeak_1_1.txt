Bibeak swings her sword.
She has done so to protect others from angry mobs before, and she has done so countless times in training.
But today, she has only herself in mind when she swings her sword.

[Character]

None of the villagers answer.
The swarm of gloompincers breaks through the barricade in front of the village.
Bibeak does not move her feet. She stands there holding her sword, raises it, swings it, and clenches her jaws.
