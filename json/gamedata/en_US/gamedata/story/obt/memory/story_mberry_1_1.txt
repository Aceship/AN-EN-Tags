L-Let's stop here. This mountain road is so twisty that if we keep driving, we might actually end up <i>closer</i> to those clouds.
Look, everyone else's stopped by the side of the road. There's nothing we can do but pray for the Catastrophe to float past us.
Ning-Ning, don't stick your head out the window. Just hold onto this talisman and keep yourself hidden.
Mom, Dad, is that really... a Catastrophe? B-But... why didn't the Catastrophe Messenger warn us?
Well, there are some disasters not even the Catastrophe Messengers can foresee.
Don't you worry, though, we'll be just fine... You'll get to grow up, Ning-Ning, as happy and peaceful as can be.
