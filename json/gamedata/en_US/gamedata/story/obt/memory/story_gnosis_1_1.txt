Three times the fowlbeast has flown past the window. Perhaps it had already flown past many times before Gnosis noticed it.
The fowlbeasts of Kjerag build their nests in the mountains. The adults leave their nests before the sun rises, foraging in human lands.
The cold climate has made them strong and sturdy.
Track the flight of a fowlbeast, and one will find that they traverse half of Kjerag in the span of a single day.
At least, that is what the books at home say.

[name="Teacher"]Let's continue from where we left off yesterday, then.
[name="Teacher"]The institutions of Kjerag share certain characteristics with Victoria.
[name="Teacher"]The three clans are analogous to the grand dukes of Victoria, while the Vine-Bear Court performs some of the functions of the king.
[name="Teacher"]By understanding Victoria's institutions, you will gain a greater understanding of where the two systems are similar, and an even greater understanding of where they are different.
[name="Teacher"]Do you concur, Master Enciodes?

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_288_1#7$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]Kjerag's institutions are built upon faith in Kjeragandr. Therefore, despite the similarities with Victoria's institutions, they are fundamentally different.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_288_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]As written in the 'Kjeragandr', the three clans formed a covenant with Kjeragandr to lead the people. The mantle of authority is merely an insignificant reward.
[name="Enciodes"]On this point, the relationship between the three clans and the Vine-Bear Court is fundamentally different from the relationship between the Victorian dukes and the king.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_272_1#1$1")]
[name="Teacher"]Excellent, Master Enciodes...
[charslot]
Gnosis pays no heed to the exchange, letting his mind wander and imagine the fowlbeast outside the winding gliding on the winds.
These fowlbeasts are smart creatures. They are waiting for leftovers from lunch that the kitchens will throw out soon. The Silverash food is among the finest in Kjerag, after all.
After they have had their fill, they will fly towards Lake Silberneherze, frolicking on the meadows there, or interact with the burdenbeasts basking in the sun.
If they are lucky, they will be thrown a scalecis or two by the fincatchers on the ice.
When the sun sets in the west, they will return to their warm nests and put an end to a productive day, like someone who has just finished a hard day of work.

Gnosis stares at the quiz paper. He finds the questions even easier than a fowlbeast finds looking for food.
His mind wanders to how fowlbeasts live their entire lives between looking for food and sleeping, interposed by the occasional territorial conflict, day after day, year after year, until they die.
It seems almost like there is some kind of law governing it, because the fowlbeasts of Kjerag do not appear to ever think about flying beyond the mountains.

His father buried in his research in a sea of books, with eyes only for the millennia of Kjerag history.
He probably does not know what time it is. He probably does not remember what his son is doing.
When he reads something that excites him, he will call out to his son, then his wife will tell him that his son is studying with the son of Master Olafur.
He would mutter a response and continue with his research. By the time his son came home, he would have forgotten what he wanted to say.
He would talk nonstop at the dinner table about what he discovered that day, and what he would discover the next.

A young fowlbeast separates from the flock, flying off in another direction, beyond the snow-capped mountains.

[name="Teacher"]Can you tell me why?

[name="Gnosis"]It's true that I don't like my life right now.
[name="Gnosis"]I don't know what kind of life I want.
[name="Gnosis"]But that doesn't mean I want to leave with you.

[name="Teacher"]What a shame.
[name="Teacher"]You've lost your one shot at freedom.

[name="Teacher"]My dear Master Enciodes, do you really think that Victoria will allow you to develop?
[name="Teacher"]Victoria takes pity on Kjerag at the moment, because you're too weak.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_272_1#1$1")]

[name="Teacher"]You're a long way from town. Even if your father realizes you've disappeared, it'll take a long time for him to find you.

[name="Gnosis"]No.
[name="Gnosis"]You outsiders don't know Kjerag.
[name="Gnosis"]A lot of wild burdenbeasts live in these lush forests.
[name="Gnosis"]Before the people of Kjerag learned to domesticate them, this was where they caught wild burdenbeasts and tamed them. You're hiding in one of the old ruins that they left behind.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_272_1#1$1")]
[name="Teacher"]Burdenbeasts? What are those docile animals going to do?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_290_1#1$1")]
[name="Gnosis"]A common misunderstanding. Burdenbeasts are not naturally docile. The tame ones that you see are the result of centuries of domestication.
