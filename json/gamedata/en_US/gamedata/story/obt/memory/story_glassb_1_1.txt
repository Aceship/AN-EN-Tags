[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#1")]
[name="Istina"]Sonya, you can see I've been assembling my outfit. The clock's behind you. You have the power to look for yourself.
[Character(name="char_115_headbr_9#6")]
[name="Zima"]It's already twenty 'til!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#1")]
[name="Istina"]Your warning is appreciated.
[Character(name="char_115_headbr_9#6")]
[name="Zima"]Yeah, I AM warning you!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#1")]
[name="Istina"]I did tell you how strenuous it is to coordinate an outfit, and that it could take a very long time. If you're hungry, you can go to the canteen for lunch, and I'll head there myself once I'm done.
[Character(name="char_115_headbr_9#3")]
[name="Zima"]Do you really need to do all this just for some food festival booth?
[Character(name="char_115_headbr_9#1")]
[name="Zima"]Sure, you're manning it, so you wanna dress up a little. But do you have to take this long? It's already been half an hour.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#3")]
[name="Istina"]Is half an hour so long?
[Character(name="char_115_headbr_9#1")]
[name="Zima"]It's not short.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#1")]
[name="Istina"]It's worth taking the time to ensure we match well with the theme of our booth.
[Character(name="char_115_headbr_9#1")]
[name="Zima"]And that theme is 'Ursus Desserts'. That's it.
[Character(name="char_115_headbr_9#1")]
[name="Zima"]Like, we're Ursus from Ursus, even if we're wearing plain old Rhodes Island uniforms, we're gonna fit the theme. How are you still working on this?

[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2",name2="char_197_poca_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]Thank you very much, Natalya. You have a class in the afternoon, don't you?

[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2",name2="char_197_poca_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Rosa"]Ah, but there is the matter of the application for the booth. You've asked that none of the surrounding booths serve beverages, and that yours should be close to the entrance, yes?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#1",name2="char_197_poca_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]That's correct. I would also like for the booth to be as large as possible, but I understand that's beyond our control.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#1",name2="char_197_poca_1#1",focus=1)]

[name="Rosa"]I would like to think so.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2",name2="char_197_poca_1#1",focus=1)]

[name="Istina"]And the same to you, Natalya.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2",name2="char_197_poca_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Rosa"]—Of course, to drag Rosalind out of the training room, you're going to need it.

[name="Rosa"]Your prospects there are far more pessimistic, I believe.
