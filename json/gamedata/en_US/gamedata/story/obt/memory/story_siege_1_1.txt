[name="Siege"]It's a form of laziness I've grown accustomed to.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]Many things cannot be achieved through sheer hard work, Vina. We use 'fate' to describe these vast and intangible forces because they cannot be defied.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]Hah. The 'inertia of depravity,' right?
[name="Siege"]Those who step out of line will be culled—gently, yet decisively—just like the Steam Knights.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]Just like... Alistair, my father.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]Vina...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]Don't worry, I have no interest in raising a stink in his name. To be honest, I never even knew him that well.
[name="Siege"]Funnily enough, when I was young, my adoptive parents used to tell me stories about my father, the great 'King Alistair,' all the time...
[name="Siege"]But they passed away too early that I barely remember those stories anymore.
[name="Siege"]It wasn't until Allerdale mentioned the King's name to me again that all those fragmented memories started to rush back. Rash, ambitious, determined to accomplish something big...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#4$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]Haha, I'm not sure what similarities we share beyond our blood ties. He was a monarch hanged for his failed reforms, offending nearly all the nobles.
[name="Siege"]As for me, I'm just a Norport gangster. The only place I'm familiar with, besides the bar and boxing gym, is the police station.
[name="Siege"]We share the surname of 'Victoria,' but that's about it.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]The Duke of Windermere's duty has always been to safeguard the border between Victoria and Leithanien. We've never paid much attention to the political struggles taking place in Londinium.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#8$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]But... it's true that my mother spoke very little of the coup and King Alistair.
[name="Delphine"]I think she deliberately avoided talking about it. I actually analyzed the situation before—
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#12$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]There wasn't anything she could do, and I understand that. Delphine, you don't need to feel sorry for me. That's just how the rules of the game are in Victoria—beneath the calm facade, everything has already been decided.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]......
[name="Delphine"]Regardless of what my mother thought at the time, I don't think the people were at fault for seeking change.
[name="Delphine"]Change is something we all want, isn't it? It's just that... nobody knows how to go about it.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]Yes. Everyone back then knew something was wrong, just as they do now.
[name="Siege"]This war indeed is reshaping Victoria, but in what direction?
[name="Siege"]But... are we truly getting any closer to the future we hope for?
[name="Siege"]We've just witnessed Wellington's betrayal, as well as the indecision of the dukes. These are things that've happened time and again.
[name="Siege"]Delphine, what do you think is the reason behind everything we're facing and what our country is going through?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]Do you really want my opinion?
[name="Delphine"]Simply put, it's because we've been deceived by the brutal and cunning Sarkaz.
[name="Delphine"]All Victoria needs is time. I could easily come to the same conclusion as every noble reading newspaper in their manor.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#7$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]But we've seen it firsthand.
[name="Delphine"]Our 'glorious homeland' is short-sighted, arrogant, and reckless. It is filled with greedy nobles, incompetent bureaucrats, a weak parliament, and landowners or factory owners who exploit their workers...
[name="Delphine"]The problem is that Victoria might always has been this way, even during what people consider as her golden age.
[name="Delphine"]––All of these things are the sources of Victoria's former glory, yet they are also the inertia that we so despise.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]......
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]But then again, we have a team now. It might be time to do more.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]What do you mean?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]Ah. It suddenly dawned on me that I might share another similarity with my father.
[name="Siege"]Both our enemy is 'Victoria.'
[name="Siege"]He might've been too reckless, but I might not be any better than him either. Maybe... I'll even meet the same end as he did.
[name="Siege"]But it's still worth a shot, isn't it?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]......
[name="Delphine"]Vina—I mean, Alexandrina Vina Victoria—do you know what you're saying right now?
[name="Delphine"]Indeed, we've found ourselves some companions, and the Exemplars have created a miracle in this battle...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#7$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]But this is just Londinium, a single city! How many cities are there across of all Victoria?
[name="Delphine"]The soldiers and officers involved in this war see you as a hero because the dukes—
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#4$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]The dukes need a hero to cover up their failures. We are just icons they use as a front. I'm well aware of that. 
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]But, so what?
[name="Siege"]We're already here.
[name="Siege"]Everything that has driven Victoria's 'inertia,' the obsession with glory, the worship of splendor, the monarchy, and the puppet Parliament...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]Must end here.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#4$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]You want to change all of that?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]More than just change.
[name="Siege"]I will wage war against them.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]It certainly won't be an easy task. We might need to fight against everything that makes up this country, including ourselves. It might take a long, long time, up to a decade or even two...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]But if I want to make sure what happened in Londinium today never happens again, this is the only way.
[name="Siege"]I need to vanquish the Victoria of the pastuntil I'm the only one left in the ring.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#4$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]I...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]......
[name="Delphine"]That's a distant dream. And, rationally speaking, it might never even come true.
[name="Delphine"]There's no shortage of reformers and even revolutionaries in this country. Some succeeded, while others failed.
[name="Delphine"]Yet, all their efforts invariably ended up lost in the mists of Londinium. And Victoria has never changed.
[name="Delphine"]But... Vina, you'll treat this as a ring, won't you?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]That's right. Regardless of what I face, there's only one thing I can do—give it a good 'slobberknocker'.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]*sigh*.
[name="Delphine"]Just to be clear, I have no intent on stepping into the ring with you.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4110_delphn_1#11$1", focus="r")]
[name="Delphine"]But... if you do manage to land a few good punches, I'll be cheering for you.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avgnew_112_siege_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Siege"]Sounds good.
[name="Siege"]It's time to let the people of Londinium know that the Exemplars are on their side!
[name="Siege"]We... are home.

The coffin was too big, and my hands felt sore. Even with the help of adults, carrying the coffin into the cemetery was a laborous task.
My adoptive father was buried right next to my adoptive mother. They both shared the same gravestone.
Those visitors who used to frequent my place when I was little didn't show up. They must have given up already. After all, it's been so long.
