[name="Amiya"]  So you're saying the employees of the newly-established branch of Karlan Trade did not receive the first batch of pharmaceuticals we sent them?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6", name2="char_013_riop", focus=2)]
[name="Guard Operator"]  Correct.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4", name2="char_013_riop", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  ......
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4", name2="char_013_riop", focus=2)]
[name="Guard Operator"]  Also, our people found this in a nearby black market.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6", name2="char_013_riop", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  This is... one of the analgesics we manufacture. You've cross-checked the serial number? 
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6", name2="char_013_riop", focus=2)]
[name="Guard Operator"]  Mhm. I specifically checked with the Logistics Department—it's the very same batch we sent. In short, there's no need for any guessing games: without a doubt, someone pawned off our medicine.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7", name2="char_013_riop", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  ......
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7", name2="char_013_riop", focus=2)]
[name="Guard Operator"]  We didn't originally plan on involving you or the Doctor. After all, companies doing stuff like this isn't exactly uncommon, and we have relatively robust procedures in place to deal with it.
[name="Guard Operator"]  But this time, we're dealing with one of Karlan Trade's branch offices, so we thought it'd be best to consult the two of you first.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_013_riop", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  Mm, I understand... Cliffheart is one of our operators now, and we do a substantial amount of business with them. Regardless of the perspective we're coming from, this matter must be handled carefully.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  The core issue is this: was this an arbitrary decision from the other party's middle management, or did it have the tacit approval of the higher-ups?
[Character(name="char_016_medic", name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]  Medic, you were a witness to the signing of the contract with Mr. Silverash. What do you think?
[Character(name="char_016_medic", name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Medic"]  Hmm... It's hard to say.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic"]  We've maintained business ties with Karlan Trade for months now. There was nothing out-of-place with this particular large-batch order either. He came to us wanting to buy medicine, and we agreed—simple as that.
[name="Medic"]  But we know nothing about how he actually views the Infected. And from the perspective of so-called business logic, he did in fact purchase this medicine from us with money.
[name="Medic"]  It belongs to him now, and what he decides to do with it is up to him.
[name="Medic"]  As for us though, this is not something we can simply write off as a 'business practice'.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic"]  Doctor, how do you view the situation?

[name="Medic"]  Oh! I totally forgot; you weren't there at the time.
[name="Medic"]  Excuse me. You've become so reliable lately that I've started to subconsciously assume that you already know everything...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  Mr. Silverash's full name is Enciodes Silverash. He's the president of Karlan Trade and one of our major clients.
[name="Amiya"]  It seems he's always hoped to purchase a degree of personal protection for his Infected employees, as well as treatment for his younger sister who was infected with Oripathy.
[name="Amiya"]  After contacting several pharmaceutical companies, he finally found us.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic"]  That's right. He was very firm about this, though cautious as well. After a lengthy negotiation, he finally placed a large order with us.
[name="Medic"]  He purchased a health insurance contract that covers all of his employees, as well as a supply of analgesics for each branch.
[name="Medic"]  Because these analgesics are only effective at the disease's onset, we keep separate statistics on the amount delivered to each branch.
[name="Medic"]  This is to ensure that every employee has a quarterly supply of them, as well as to allow the company to hold reserves.
[name="Medic"]  Those were his demands.
[name="Medic"]  To be honest, it was the first time I've seen an employer set aside this much money for Infected employees.
[name="Medic"]  As for the kind of person the president is...

[name="Enciodes"]  As such, I hope your company will be able to offer me a discount.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic"]  Well...
[name="Medic"]  The size of this order is massive compared to anything else Rhodes Island has ever gotten. As a matter of principle, it's understandable that you'd want a discount.
[name="Medic"]  However, the raw materials used to produce these drugs are also very expensive. In fact, the price of one dose of analgesic is not much higher than the cost.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  If you lack the authority to make this decision, then you can ask the head of your company, Miss Amiya, to speak with me.

[name="Medic"]  No, I can make this decision.
[name="Medic"]  What I wanted to say is––
[name="Medic"]  Rhodes Island makes drugs to help the Infected.

[Character(name="char_016_medic", name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]  He sounds nothing like those bosses who make it obvious that they don't want to spend a single cent paying for medicine for their Infected employees.
[Character(name="char_016_medic", name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Medic"]  Yeah. To be honest, even if what I saw was just a publicity stunt, there aren't many bosses in this world who would even bother putting on a show like that.

[Character(name="avg_npc_001", name2="avg_npc_002", focus=2)]
[name="Infected Employee"]  Yeah. I actually used to work at a different factory. After I got sick, I was transferred here, which is specifically for Infected employees.
[name="Infected Employee"]  At first I thought it'd be like the stuff you always hear about. Y'know, about how ordinary people wouldn't last a week in the conditions Infected workers had to deal with.
[name="Infected Employee"]  But turns out it was a lot better than I expected.
[name="Infected Employee"]  Plus, President Silverash personally bought us Oripathy painkillers from some drug company...

[name="Enciodes"]  I went to Rhodes Island to purchase medication and an insurance package for all of you, to ensure the health and safety of all my Infected employees.
[name="Enciodes"]  However, due to the negligence of our management as well as the local manager, this medicine was not properly delivered to you. For this, I deeply apologize.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005")]
[name="Infected Employee A"]  It isn't your fault!
[Character(name="avg_npc_006")]
[name="Infected Employee B"]  It's all Dyott's fault!
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  Yes, Dyott has already been fired, and a new manager will be selected from among you.
[name="Enciodes"]  I hope that this will help ensure better conditions for you to continue with your work.

[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  In particular, there are two people here I'd like to thank.
[name="Enciodes"]  Both are special investigators from Rhodes Island... Thanks to their bravery, I was able to discover what Dyott had been hiding from me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_006", focus=1)]
[name="Infected Employee A"]  Isn't that the new guy...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_006", focus=2)]
[name="Infected Employee B"]  So they're from the company that makes our medicine?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_006", focus=1)]
[name="Infected Employee A"]  They're willing to do all that for our sakes...?

[name="Enciodes"]  There are many who do not understand why I would purchase medication. This lack of understanding eventually gave rise to violations of company policy.
[name="Enciodes"]  In order to prevent this situation from occurring again, I negotiated with Rhodes Island to send an undercover team to secretly surveil this branch office.
[name="Enciodes"]  The intent was to sniff out people like Dyott, who would harm both our company's operations as well as Rhodes Island's image.
[name="Enciodes"]  In return, Rhodes Island is willing to deepen its cooperation with Karlan Trade and further reduce the price of medication.
