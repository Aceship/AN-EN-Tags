[name="Grandmother"]For now, let's give you a name.

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_369_bena_1#5$1",focus="r")]

[name="Grandmother"]There was once a pair of dearly close children who were soon to part, who entrusted to Granny a letter to safekeep.
[name="Grandmother"]Should they be wed, their letter would be returned to them on the day their child was born, care of the Castle of Dreams.
[name="Grandmother"]It was the most complicated request I'd taken in a long while.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_369_bena_1#9$1",focus="r")]

[name="Grandmother"]'Bena'.

[name="Grandmother"]There were a great many names on that letter, little lamb.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_369_bena_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Bena"]So if—if they had a second girl, what would she be named?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_093",bstart=0.3,bend=0.7,focus="l")]
[name="Grandmother"]'Annie'.
[name="Grandmother"]You see, little lamb? This is the work Granny does.
[name="Grandmother"]Someone has to be watching. Someone has to make good.
[name="Grandmother"]But Granny's old, now, and can't keep up with it anymore.
[name="Grandmother"]Little lamb, would you like to learn? To take on a little of Granny's work for her?

[name="Grandmother"]No, little lamb, that you needn't learn.

[name="Bena"]'The art of safekeeping'?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_093",bstart=0.3,bend=0.7,focus="l")]
[name="Grandmother"]To preserve an item untouched, unchanging over decades and centuries, to be returned to one's hands just the same as when it had left.
[name="Grandmother"]Would you like to learn it?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_369_bena_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Bena"]Yes, Granny.

[name="Grandmother"]Then allow me to commence the first lesson.
[name="Grandmother"]Everything, with no exception, has to begin from a wish.
[name="Grandmother"]Come make a wish, little lamb. Preserve a thing for future you.
[name="Grandmother"]What would you like to leave, to your future self?

[name="Grandmother"]Very well, five years.
