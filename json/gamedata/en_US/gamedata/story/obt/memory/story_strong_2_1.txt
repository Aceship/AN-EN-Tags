Jaye keeps running.
He most likely bumped into a few passersby, and he definitely knocked over the fruit stand on the street corner. He keeps muttering, 'deoi m zyu,' but he doesn't stop.
His friend is right ahead. His friend is still running.
He has no time to even think about which streets he has been running through. He notices nothing except how there are less and less people, the roads are getting narrower, and his surroundings are getting quieter. So quiet, he can hear nothing but his and his friend's panting.
The oxygen deprivation is causing him to hallucinate.
