[name="Frostleaf"]Sounds like a young person wanting to get back together with their lover after they broke up, and they feel like a lost star...

Frostleaf puts away the vocabulary book in her hand, and crumples up several sheets of paper.
She stretches her neck, and walks out of the dormitory, where she had been for a long time.

The hall outside is still a hall, and the room is still a room, but—
'Instructions for Rhodes Island Operators'
'Today's Cafeteria Menu, featuring a Leithanian head chef!'
'Oranges sent from home, feel free to eat them!'
'Don't forget about the event in Perfumer's garden today!'
'The snack shelf has been restocked!'
She suddenly realizes she can understand all these previously meaningless symbols. The doorplates, the menus, the notices, they all have their own meanings.
In a way, it felt as if she suddenly belonged here.
