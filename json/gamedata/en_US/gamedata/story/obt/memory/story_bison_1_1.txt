Bison leans against a tree and thinks about everything that has happened today, in an attempt to come up with anything that could explain this absurd turn of events.
But right now, he isn't very keen on thinking too hard.
Perhaps the chilly New Year's Eve breeze has left his mind completely blank.
Perhaps the strange events that unfolded throughout the day have numbed his thought process.
Or perhaps... he simply doesn't want to think, and just wants to lean against the tree.
That is, until a ball comes tumbling toward his feet, rousing him from his daze.

Bison suddenly recalls that it's been a very long time since he played football.
His father forced him to join the family business before he had even graduated. And he had to sacrifice a lot for it.
He lifts his head up and gazes at the child in the distance waiting for him to kick the ball back.
They have no grass field to play on, but a dirt pit is more than enough.
They have no goals, but a couple of tin cans will do the trick.
They kick erratically, and their play is all over the place, but what does it matter as long as it's fun?
Bison suddenly realizes that it has been a very long time since he last did anything just for fun.
