[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]I'm fine. I've been scratched up like this many times before. I'll be okay with a bandage.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]I'm probably not one to talk, but you don't seem like you can hold your own in a fight that well. I'm surprised you managed to survive this long.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]I saw you use Arts to move the cover. That's the technique of a seasoned veteran.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]How long have you been on the battlefield?
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="char_009_12fce_1",focus=2)]

[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]Well, you're a humble one, I'll give you that.

[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="char_009_12fce_1",focus=2)]

[name="???"]The mission may be a failure, but I'm not planning on dying here.

[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]Scout? You?
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]Listen, I'm not trying to look down on you, brother.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]But I promise, it doesn't matter how much cover your Arts can make you. The moment you poke your head out, you'll be blown to pieces.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]My suggestion: We stay here and observe.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="char_009_12fce_1",focus=2)]
[name="???"]I'm afraid we can't do that.

[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="char_009_12fce_1",focus=2)]
[name="???"]They're light infantry. Most likely the Kuranta mercenaries. There may be others as well... They work together fairly often, after all.
[name="???"]Once they charge in here, we won't have anywhere to run.
[name="???"]They might even have some caster drones with them.

[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]How'd you know that much?
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="char_009_12fce_1",focus=2)]

[name="???"]I could be wrong, of course, but that should more or less be it.

[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="char_009_12fce_1",focus=2)]
