Cantabile looks at the fowlbeast, and the critter's two shiny black eyes also peer back at her.
Just then, it hops over unsteadily, trying to snuggle up to the person who rescued it.

The young patient picks up a small musical instrument placed at her bedside and plucks the strings clumsily, making an out-of-tune sound.
The fowlbeast chirps softly, as if to sing along.
[name="Resting Patient"]Ahaha! You've been practicing for so long, and that's the best you can do?
[name="Feeble Patient"]What are you talkin' about? She hasn't had anyone to teach her. The fact that she can even make a sound is pretty good.
[name="Feeble Patient"]It might not be what you can call a song yet, but I don't mind listening to it every now and then.
A hand reaches out, covering the young patient's tiny hand—
Cantabile lightly plucks the strings, and a little ditty drifts through the quiet sickbay. She's playing a piece she's never played before. There is no score, only the mood of the moment conducting her.
