[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Of course do. When I was helping out at the mead store back home, I would write 'All checked' after I'd received and checked all the goods.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]

[name="Myrtle"]Wasn't that smart?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]...Let me explain.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]The mission report is submitted to HR, and then to your supervisor. It's a very important part of our work. You need to take it seriously.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#3$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#5$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#5$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]Calm down, Myrtle.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#5$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Two or three days, I think. They're probably still... Hey, you don't mean—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]Just slip it into the pile and no one's the wiser.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#3$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]So I can sneak in then?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]But that's against the rules...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#5$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]I remember now! The operator's manual says you have to submit a mission report, but it doesn't say when!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]We wouldn't have had to deal with this if you'd just remembered that earlier.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Whew... Now I don't feel so anxious.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]It's too soon to relax. You need to fill it out ASAP and sneak it into the pile before they're all taken away!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]We'll help you recall what happened on the mission and finish the report, okay?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#7$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]O-Okay. I guess it's pretty serious.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]Let's start from the beginning. Do you still remember?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#7$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Of course! We went into the barrens with that caravan. Our mission was to escort it to the destination.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]Good. Write that down. Next?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#4$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Well... the sun was hot and the air was dry. I was thinking I should put on more sunscreen the next time—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]You don't need to put in anything that doesn't have to do with the mission!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Alright, how about this? Just write down what I say.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]There was nothing out of the ordinary during the first half of the escort mission, aside from a few wild animal attacks.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#7$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Got it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]At 1604 hours... don't forget the zero.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]At 1604 hours, we encountered bandits in the wilderness. I was responsible for protecting the caravan and providing combat support.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]During the fighting, I made the decision to unload the goods from the trucks, which helped repel a wave of enemies.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Done? Let me see.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#7$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Here you go.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]'And then I accidentally chased the enemy away...' That's totally different from what I said!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#8$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Nice and simple, isn't it? Exactly as it happened.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Just that? But I saw you...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#4$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Yeah, I was protecting those guys.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#4$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]While you were fighting over there, I saw a bunch of people coming from the other side.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#4$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]A good generalissimo knows when to fight and when to retreat, so I called for them to get onto the trucks so that they could get out of there.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Then you unloaded the goods...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#8$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Less weight means more speed, right?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]...So it was just an accident?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Should we put it in like she said, Susan?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]I guess we could, but...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]You should think about how the accident had the effect it did. That's why we write reports, after all.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#5$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]I have to put that in even if I didn't think about it?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]Reports aren't just to let others know how we do things, or for command personnel to reference. They're for self-reflection too.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]In cases like this, we should consider the situation, weigh the pros and cons, find a solution, and put it into action. Mission reports are about writing down what you were thinking at the time.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]And if you weren't thinking, you should organize your thoughts now, in the report.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#4$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]I see. So since there's a thought behind every action, and I should think about it now if I wasn't thinking during the mission?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]Correct.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Can I try to fill out the rest myself?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Sure. I'll look over it once you're done.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]Hoger, there's something I need to check with you.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]The part where we chased the bandits back to their hideout and took the goods back... I was acting separately from you two at the time.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]You were fighting the bandits at close range while I provided fire support from above.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]We'd better cross-check the parts that I'm not entirely sure about, so that we can keep Myrtle... focused.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]I remember that! We started fighting at the entrance of their base!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#4$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]I wanted to lead the charge, but it was my first time seeing a battlefield like that, so all I could do was get the others to cover.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]That was more than enough.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#4$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]We had the advantage until they brought out some big thing, like, THIS big, that blew up a truck with one shot!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#5$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]We would've been blown up too, if you hadn't pull us into cover!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]There was no intel about any heavy weapons. It might have been a recent acquisition.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]I heard you talking about it over the comms. There was a lot of smoke and I was busy calibrating the distance, so I didn't really see what was happening.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]I was wondering, though... How did the two of you charge into the fray under that kind of firepower?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]What did you do, Hoger?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]I-It wasn't me. It was Myrtle...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#8$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]It was all thanks to Hoger! He was amazing!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Huh?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]What?!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#6$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]I saw it with my own eyes!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#6$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Hoger leapt out of cover and charged forward with a war cry, and everyone else followed!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#8$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]The bandits must've been shocked, because they just stood there motionless! It was like they were under a spell!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#6$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]So Hoger just punched the guy, and down he went!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]......
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#3$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Hey, why are you guys so quiet?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]I remember it all so clearly! I'm gonna write it down now.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]Hoger...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Myrtle, don't you remember what you did?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#7$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Me? I just did what you asked, keeping everyone safe and supporting them as much as I can. Last but not least—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#6$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]I gave everyone a morale boost, like a generalissimo should!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]It may have been my first mission, but I'm really good at that!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]I-Is that all?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Yeah!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]...That's not how it went. Wasn't it all thanks to you that we won?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Oh, stop teasing me, Hoger. Mom always told me not to take credit for something I didn't do.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]This is how it happened, Susan:
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Myrtle ran up to the front and jumped up on the ATV we were using for cover. Then...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]...She raised her white flag high and waved it. Everybody could see it clearly.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]I was freaking out and trying to pull her down when I realized... it wasn't just us. The enemy was dumbfounded too.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]So I took the opportunity to charge in while they weren't shooting. The rest went as she described.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#8$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Oh yeah, I was waving my flag! Haha, forgot about that.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#8$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Well, it was nothing. It's the generalissimo's job to keep up morale!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#8$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]People always feel energized whenever they look at me! It always worked when I did it at home, anyway!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]That's it?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#8$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Yeah. To get something done, we all have to come together. We can do it if we work together!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]And there I was, wondering how you came up with the idea of waving a white flag...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]
[name="Myrtle"]Sounds like it had an unexpected effect again. I think I know what to put in the report now...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]What are you going to write?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_972_1#1$1")]
[name="HR Operator"]Hm? Why do you ask?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]Oh, well, er... we were on the same mission, and we submitted our reports a while ago, right?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_972_1#1$1")]
[name="HR Operator"]Oh, there's no problem. But honestly, I was wondering that myself, because the Doctor handed this to me just now.

[name="Operator Susan"]The Doctor?!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_972_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_151_myrtle_1#1$1")]

[name="HR Operator"]Thanks for coming over today. I wanted to talk to you about Myrtle's performance.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_972_1#1$1")]
[name="HR Operator"]Don't worry, it's not that there's a problem. All the missions she's performed with you have gone smoothly. We just want to know more.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]...I'd still like to know the reason you're asking.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_972_1#1$1")]
[name="HR Operator"]Very well. There are some... discrepancies between her mission reports and yours.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_972_1#1$1")]
[name="HR Operator"]Frankly, they don't even sound like they're from the same mission.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]...Didn't she said she understood?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]It's our fault for taking her word for it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_972_1#1$1")]
[name="HR Operator"]Also... she submitted a few hand-drawn pictures along with her last report. Take a look.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]...Generalissimo Myrtle's Tactics Manual?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_972_1#1$1")]
[name="HR Operator"]She seems to believe that operators who work with her should understand her tactical thinking. So she put this together so other operators could review it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_972_1#1$1")]
[name="HR Operator"]You two have spend a lot of time with her. Do you have any, er... questions about her?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]...Hoger?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]Of course I do. Who doesn't?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Hoger"]I don't think it matters, though. She has a knack for making things simple.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]As far as I'm concerned, it's easier to just charge forward with her than try to understand her through those pictures. We can put our trust in an outstanding operator like Myrtle.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_972_1#1$1")]
[name="HR Operator"]Understood. I have no further questions. Thank you for your time.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"](Whisper) That was the right conclusion to reach, right?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_089")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_088")]
[name="Operator Susan"]Excuse me... could we borrow Myrtle's Tactics Manual for a couple of days?
