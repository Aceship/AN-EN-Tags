[name="Genial Noble"]If it is not too much trouble for you, would you allow us to follow you and observe how a photographer with such a unique understanding of the art captures such profound images?
[name="Genial Noble"]As I'm sure you well know, there are many who struggle to find meaning. And even among those who don't, they are often unable to elevate themselves to the next level. They fail to self-actualize.

Day after day, Scene continues to wander through the ruins.

She remains silent, for the battlefield is whispering to her.
Within her camera, the ruins change from real objects to shadows: the present moment turns into a flat, delicate sheet.
But behind it is the weight of reality, a freeze-frame of a moment powerful enough to overwhelm reality itself.
It is more real than the things written on a page, an affirmation of the very land's experience, a call to awaken one's consciousness.

Scene has read the records of this war: back when the battlefield was cleaned up, a crossbow bolt pulled from a corpse was heavier than the body itself.
They clearly knew they would die, yet they still fought on.
Their blood dyed the ground black, so thick that not a single plant could grow here.
The distant morning light penetrates the thin clouds and sprinkles across the ground. This place of death finally glows with a bit of the sun's golden light.
Atop a high, withered branch, Scene presses the shutter to record this moment of false life.
A hoarse fowlbeast rises from the dead branch, its thin claws loosening up a small puff of dust. Time flies away from this single fragment of a moment.
