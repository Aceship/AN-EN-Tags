[Character]
In the alleys of Lungmen, Exusiai is making deliveries in her own special way, as usual.
What she doesn't know is that on a rooftop not far away, someone is watching her.

[name="Mostima"]  Tsk tsk, El is playful as ever, and her marksmanship continues to improve.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1")]
[name="Mostima"]  You think so too, right? Watching her makes me miss my gun.
[name="Mostima"]  Get Rhodes Island to make a gun-staff? Perish the thought... If Lemuen saw, she'd make fun of me.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3")]
[name="Mostima"]  Besides, wouldn't that look like I'm pining for the past?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1")]
[name="Mostima"]  Hm? I'm not that sentimental.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#5")]
[name="Mostima"]  But it's not like I've forgotten either.
[name="Mostima"]  Times change, and so do people. I thought you'd know that better than anyone.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1")]
[name="Mostima"]  ...That's true. You perceive things different from we do, huh.
[name="Mostima"]  I do think about it sometimes. What does change feel like when you count time by the century?
[name="Mostima"]  Can you find meaning in a subtle feeling at all?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3")]
[name="Mostima"]  I mean, you know it doesn't matter to me anyway.
[PlaySound(key="$d_gen_walk_n", volume=0.6)]
[Character(name="avg_npc_035")]
[name="Yith"]  Oh, so it was you, Mostima.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#4")]
[name="Mostima"]  Yith?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  G'day.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Does Emperor need me for something?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Not really. There hasn't been anything major lately. I was just passing by when I felt a familiar aura.
[name="Yith"]  And that's... Exusiai over there? I see, I see, just another day of work.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  That's right. Also took the chance to take this little fella out for some fresh air and a little chat.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Ah, sounds like a good time. I'm jealous.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  What about you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Same as always. No rest for the wicked.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  You work too hard.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Oh, please. It's what I was made for.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  By the way, since you're here, I'd like to ask you a favor.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Let's hear it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  I've got a nasty complainer here lately. Might be something wrong with the lock. I was hoping you'd take a look for me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Ah, I thought the lock was looking a bit worn down when you gave it to me for safekeeping last Sauin. Wouldn't surprise me if there were some minor problems.
[name="Yith"]  Pass it over then, I'll take care of it.
[name="Yith"]  Your other one's fine?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Sure, it's in the lock. The other one's just the key. Won't give me any issues.

[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  It happens.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Speaking of which, Mostima, I've never asked you this before, but I'm curious - where did you get this lock and key?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  It was somewhere around Kazdel before it came into my hands.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Near Kazdel, huh... That explains a lot.
[name="Yith"]  Can't say I expected that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  If you want more details, I mean, I could tell you the whole story. But I don't really feel like it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  The whole story... Are you talking about the Liberi girl?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Yeah, you've met?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Just once, last Sauin.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Pain in the ass, isn't she?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]

'Bang!' Suddenly, a crossbow bolt penetrates into the space between Mostima and Yith.

[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  See?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Seems like she's no fan of mine.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  No, she's just getting pissy at me. Any other questions?
[name="Mostima"]  Really dig deep there. I joined Penguin Logistics because of you and Emperor, but we haven't had any serious talks since then.
[name="Mostima"]  So hit me with any questions you got.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Have you considered looking for the other pieces?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  This is the only one left.
[name="Mostima"]  And even if it wasn't, it's not into the idea, and neither am I. Might as well leave things as they are.
[name="Mostima"]  You know though, if it really wasn't interested, it wouldn't have ended up like this in the first place.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  I see. That does make sense.
[name="Yith"]  Much of the way we are now can be attributed to similar decisions.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Actually, I've asked it before, whether it wanted to come out.
[name="Mostima"]  Let me think... That's right, it was during the Rhodes Island operator test.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Why?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Umm... I guess because it seemed like an interesting place, so I wanted to show them what I could do?
[name="Mostima"]  Might've also been because I wanted to scare the Doctor.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  This one wouldn't cooperate, though. It felt something, I guess.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  And hey, I gotta hand it to 'em, Rhodes Island is definitely interesting. You should check it out yourself, if you have the time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Yes, if I have the time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  And when might that be?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  Who knows? Keep an eye on Emperor's mood. If it sours, I might have some time on my hands.
[name="Yith"]  But meetings between people are wonderful things indeed.
[name="Yith"]  After its hibernation, it actually met a wielder so well suited to it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Maybe.
[name="Mostima"]  But if I'm being real, it's brought me way more headaches than power.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  But you don't mind, do you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Guess I don't.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yith"]  In any case, that's enough chatting for the day.
[name="Yith"]  I'll let you know how the staff turns out.

[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suffering"]  Who the hell was that? I know Emperor's got something crazy going on underneath, but I never knew Penguin Logistics had anyone like that.
[name="Suffering"]  You actually gave him your staff, and he seemed pretty comfortable with it.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Let's say it's his area of expertise and he's trustworthy.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suffering"]  Let's say your trust and that crossbow bolt have a conversation.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Do you need an explanation? I'm an open book.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suffering"]  No thanks... 'they' obviously know what's going on, and just decided not to tell me.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suffering"]  And that means I shouldn't be hearing it from you.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  And that doesn't bother you at all?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suffering"]  My job is to keep my eyes on your horns. Beyond that, it's none of my business.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  You don't care at all?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Suffering"]  ......
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Hey, hear me out. You volunteered to watch me, way back when, but there's a ton of stuff you have no way of knowing. And you're running yourself ragged to keep up with me. That's some serious masochism.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suffering"]  As if I need you to spell it all out.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  I'll say it again: what happened in Kazdel wasn't your fault.
[name="Mostima"]  Whether you were there or not, I would've pulled the trigger.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Suffering"]  And you don't care that you've turned into this, I take it?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Bingo! See, you're getting to know me better and better.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Suffering"]  And my choices are none of your business.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Sure, sure— Oh yeah, some folks from the Notarial Hall swung by yesterday, right? Another new job?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Suffering"]  Not for the time being, just a routine report. But...

[name="Mostima"]  That bad, huh? Lay it on me, I could use some cheering up.

[name="Suffering?"]  ...One-Armed Chainsaw Guy.

[name="Mostima"]  Huh... Did they just watch that shitty Lungmen flick?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  I brought it back. Ugh, I should've known better. Why didn't I bring them something artsy?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Hah, hah, hah. Maybe you'll be Guns n' Roses next time.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Do I look that bored to you?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  If you ask me, I'd say that there aren't many people in this world more bored than you.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Do you really think so highly of me?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  That wasn't a compliment.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  What matters is that I take it as a compliment.

[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Anyway, that really wasn't my plan. Just had to swing by to take a look, call it force of habit. Wouldn't be my first time doing this either, and you should know that.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  I do. That you're not proactively trying to make contact with her is a good thing in my opinion, but...
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Ever since I had that little chat with her last Sauin, you've been totally fixated on it.
[name="Mostima"]  Are you worried that I'll tell her something?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  If that was your plan, I might not be able to stop you. So I need to know how you feel about it.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Hmm... Fine then.
[name="Mostima"]  I know that look in your eyes. You're not gonna leave until I give you an answer.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  I'm glad you understand.
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  Force speaks louder than reason with you.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Tell me this... what's the best way to make someone stop caring about you?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  To disappear from their life.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  No, not good enough. Once you've appeared, there's no way to completely disappear.
[name="Mostima"]  You have to wait for that person to find a new life, a new environment.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  To tell the truth, I never thought she'd come running here from Laterano.
[name="Mostima"]  When Emperor told me she joined Penguin Logistics, I was quite shocked.
[name="Mostima"]  But you know, that whole time until Sauin, I never once spoke to her.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  As for what happened then... Just consider it part of the festivities.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  She's not going to give up looking for you.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  But she's not actually looking for me.
[name="Mostima"]  It's not like she had anything to do with it, at least not directly, but we all have to keep our mouths shut.
[name="Mostima"]  Is that something I can clue her in on? Tell me, One-Armed Chainsaw Guy.

[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  Please don't unironically call me that name.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  Unfortunately, it's absolutely top secret, so you cannot.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  See, I can't tell her the thing she wants to know the most, so what's the point of me showing up in her life?
[name="Mostima"]  Give her little hints here and there, pique her interest, and drag her into this whole mess?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  So, you want her to stop caring about you?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Isn't that what you want too?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  As I said, from an official standpoint, I'd like her to distance herself from any matters concerning you. Personally speaking though, I don't really care.

[name="Mostima"]  Honestly, if you were to ask me if that's really what I want, I don't think I'd say yes.
[name="Mostima"]  But when I let go of Laterano, cut all my ties, it was just as easy as when I raised my gun that one time. No hesitation.
[name="Mostima"]  All I can say is, if something happens, just let it be.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  That is indeed the kind of person you are, and I don't like it. You don't care about loss.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Lots of people dislike that about me.
[name="Mostima"]  But color me interested. What good comes from caring about loss?
[name="Mostima"]  You end up crying your eyes out over whatever you've lost and whatever you see yourself losing, and then what?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  I'm not here to talk philosophy with you. All I'll say is, if you really think that, then why did you come to watch her?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Take a guess?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  No clue. I don't suppose you're lame enough to be doing this in hopes that she'll realize you're here.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  You haven't been reading sappy romance novels, have you? Go easy on that stuff.

[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=15, ystrength=15, vibrato=20, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  Grrr!
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Oh, did Lemuen ever tell you why El is named after her? Why is her name Lemuel when the two of them are obviously not blood-related?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  She keeps her work and her home life separate.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]  True.
[name="Mostima"]  The reason's simple. When she joined that family, El hadn't been born yet, and the parents decided it would be nice to integrate her into the family.
[name="Mostima"]  Though, that couple is just as joyous as El. If you told me they were just too lazy to come up with another name, I'd probably buy that.
[name="Mostima"]  In any case, Lemuen might not straight up say it, but she's really grateful to those parents, deep down.
[name="Mostima"]  And she cared even more about her little sister Lemuel.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  So what does that have to do with anything you're doing here?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  I'll spell it out for you, One-Armed Chainsaw Guy.
[name="Mostima"]  I'm thinking that Lemuen would let Lemuel leave Laterano, not just because she wanted to.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  She's a discerning one. If El really got obsessed with you-know-what, I don't think she would've let her go.
[name="Mostima"]  It is precisely because that matter had nothing to do with El, and because finding me is not some obsession she can't give up—
[name="Mostima"]  —that she could come to Lungmen and join Penguin Logistics.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  What Lemuen really wants is for El to see the world and find her own life.
[name="Mostima"]  And she kind of indirectly handed the responsibility to look after El over to me.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  Even though you left without saying goodbye?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Precisely because I left without saying goodbye.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  Watching her from a distance probably doesn't count as 'looking after.'
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  It's not like I left Penguin Logistics because of her either. It's something I should've done from the beginning, right?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  ......
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  So you're doing all this because you believe it's what Lemuen wants you to do?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Who knows.
[name="Mostima"]  Might've just been an excuse I came up with to explain why I'm doing this.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  Well that's a surprise. I never expected you to come up with such a sentimental excuse.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  I'm not a robot. There just happens to be a whole lot of stuff I don't care about.
[name="Mostima"]  Guilt, nostalgia, sorrow, etcetera etcetera. My heart's packed full of 'em all, but I've got them smoothed out pretty good now.
[name="Mostima"]  But if you or Lemuen decided to cut ties with me or something, I'd feel pretty sad.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  For how long?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Dunno, I could probably manage a week, yeah?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  That's a damn long time.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  From ten-thousand feet, you could say I also grew up with those sisters. Since El came here, it's only natural I'd keep an eye out for her.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  So, you plan to keep going along like this?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  More or less? She seems to be getting on just fine with her current partners.
[name="Mostima"]  I do think we'll meet once in a pair of blue moons, here or there, but only out of happenstance. That's good enough for you, isn't it?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  That's fair...
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  ...is what I'd like to say, though from a personal perspective, I don't think it'd be fair to her, even if I'm not qualified to say it.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  I guess. But ever since I became the owner of the lock and key, fairness has kind of left my vocabulary.
[name="Mostima"]  If I've got a reason to talk to her, I'm not gonna dodge it. If there is something I have to tell her, I'll deliver the message in person.
[name="Mostima"]  But the truth is... I don't have a reason, or anything like that.
[name="Mostima"]  I have my mission, and this girl already found a new life in this city.
[name="Mostima"]  Don't you think that's actually fair, in a sense?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="One-Armed Chainsaw Guy"]  As long as you're fine with the status quo.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]  Alright, shoo already. If someday, by some stroke of ill fortune, she ends up getting tangled in our side's mess, we can pick up this discussion again.
