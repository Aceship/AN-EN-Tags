[name="Candela"]Besides, truly worthwhile things aren't afraid to stick around for a while, just like the bottle of rum sitting on the table – produced in my private winery, aged for seven years, the finest batch of that year.
[name="Candela"]Seven years in the darkness has only served to enhance its aroma.

[name="Tequila"]Haha. Thank you, Ms. Candela. Half a glass will do. After being away for so long, I can't hold my liquor as well as before.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5",name2="avg_npc_198_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Candela"]That is fine. Mr. Booker, please pour out half a glass for our guest.
