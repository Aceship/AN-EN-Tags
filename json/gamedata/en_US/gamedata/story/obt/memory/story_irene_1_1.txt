[name="Saint Carmen"]Irene, you can step down without leaving the Inquisition altogether, you know.

[name="Irene"]Huh?

[name="Saint Carmen"]You can become our Messenger to Rhodes Island, and cooperate with them on our behalf.

[name="Saint Carmen"]Remember, Irene. Your decision today will be the next step in Ægir's partnership with Iberia.

[name="Irene"]...Yes, sir!

[name="Saint Carmen"]See, Kal'tsit?
[name="Saint Carmen"]For me, the opportunity for Ægir and Iberia to rejoin hands came far, far too late.
[name="Saint Carmen"]Even if they've given us an opportunity to turn things around, time has taken its toll on me, and I can no longer feel even the slightest bit of joy from it.
[name="Saint Carmen"]But for her, it truly is the dawn of a new day.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]If their evolution is the instinct of life itself, then the decision she made just now must surely be the instinct of civilization.
