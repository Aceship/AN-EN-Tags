No, not compared to Astgenne.
Her sister continues to break new ground, striving for the lifestyle she wants. Meanwhile, she herself lacks the courage to even rebut her father's doubts.
Astrology is a school of tradition. It is not as systematic as modern science, but it is old, and with age comes authority.
She realized at an early age that her explorations and questions would be shot down by her teachers, or given an established answer. And she would accept it, even if she did not agree.
No mistakes were made, therefore they must be right.
She is afraid of being denied by authority, and so she accepts their conclusions without question.
Then why did Oripathy break that barrier?
[Character(name="avg_274_Astesia_1#2")]
Is it because she encountered the dilemma of either denying authority or denying self?
Or did her sister's courage inspire her to face her longtime doubts?
Astesia does not yet have the answer.

Other than preparing meals, Astgenne spends the rest of the day by Astesia's side, making life stuck in a hospital bed more bearable.
Astgenne wanted to stay by her sister's side as night fell too, but Astesia persuaded her to return to her own quarters.
She knows that bright stars fill the sky above Rhodes Island as it travels.
She has seen that sight countless times, but continues to be fascinated by the uncertainty that lies within. She would gaze upon it forever, if she could, but right now—

The doctor turns off the lights before she leaves. Astesia falls asleep, dreaming of the starry sky.
She has loved the stars from a young age, just as her sister loved science.
For her, watching the skies is a habit born of both nature and nurture.
Which is why it hurt so much to be rejected and denied.
Not because she was rejected by authority, but because of the regret that she did not understand.
The more she studies this abstract wisdom, the smaller she feels.
Does the answer truly lie in the stars?
Astesia does not know the answer.
