Ten minutes ago, Councilor Jones had been lounging comfortably on his sofa, sipping the wine his servants had prepared for him. Their backs blended into the light, while the shadows of his guards were reflected at his feet.
In Caladon, such an arrangement allows him to enjoy many a perfectly peaceful night in his mansion.
But few things are absolute.

The Councilor falls to the ground on his back, flailing his hands in an attempt to drive away the paper dolls encircling him.
He picks up a wine glass, aiming its contents at a paper doll. The wine seeps into the paper, and the swirl of white turns red as it fills the room with an alcoholic aroma.
Head in hands, the councilor huddles in a corner of the room, leaving only his rotund backside shaking in view.

As if they had gotten what they wanted, the paper dolls stop spinning around the councilor and instead hover quietly.
Then, they stretch out their bodies, reverting to their original sheets of paper before landing on the ground. The councilor panics and crumples them, afraid that they might once again take flight.

In the midst of the flurry, a document lands quietly on the middle of his desk.
His hands trembling, Councilor Jones picks it up—

The councilor bends down and scrambles to gather the papers scattered on the floor, fearfully scanning the heading and contents of each sheet, as if afraid to see something else on them.
He looks around, wary of the entire room. He then pulls back the curtains with a flourish.
Someone is definitely behind this! And he's going to find out who!
