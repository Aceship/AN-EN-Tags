[name="Keen Famiglia Juror"]Tsk, tsk. The courtroom sure is lively today.
[name="Composed Famiglia Juror"]Today's trial will be open to the general public, and broadcasted live. Far too many people will be joining in on the fun.
[name="Keen Famiglia Juror"]Heh, this is the first time I've seen jurors representing so many different famiglie arrive in such an orderly fashion. This almost seems more like a press conference than a trial.
[name="Composed Famiglia Juror"]After all, the man on trial today is none other than Leontuzzo Bellone.
[name="Composed Famiglia Juror"]Signora Sicilia gave the order that 'the famiglie are not to interfere with the new city' but didn't elaborate on her plans beyond that. Everybody's scratching their heads.
[name="Composed Famiglia Juror"]Finally, the court representing Signora Sicilia's will is about to make its move, so of course it has everyone's undivided attention.
[name="Keen Famiglia Juror"]But, the woman adjudicating the trial is that Judge Lavinia, and everybody knows she's tied up with the Bellones.
[name="Composed Famiglia Juror"]There's no Bellones anymore, they're stricken from the books. What kind of connections could she have?
[name="Composed Famiglia Juror"]If you ask me, she's taking the initiative to convict Leontuzzo, exactly because she wants to show everybody she's done with the Bellones.
[name="Keen Famiglia Juror"]And besides, Signora Sicilia's made it pretty clear what she's up to here. She's gonna make an example of him.
[name="Keen Famiglia Juror"]She's playing her cards well.
[name="Composed Famiglia Juror"]Who knows.
[name="Composed Famiglia Juror"]Anyways, since Bernardo was the mastermind behind everything, his son's obviously involved. Today's trial should give us the closure we're looking for.

[name="Leontuzzo"]As the former heir to a famiglia, there's no way I can empathize with your perspectives and experiences.
[name="Leontuzzo"]What I have to suffer now... is just dealing with whatever's left over after unloading that identity.
[name="Leontuzzo"]Also, from a utilitarian perspective, the people trust you, and this is a real chance for you to lock in that image.
[Character(name="avg_427_vigil_1#1$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lavinia"]If you put it like that, I'm afraid a lot of people will see this trial as nothing more than a show.
[Character(name="avg_427_vigil_1#1$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#5$1",focus=1)]
[name="Leontuzzo"]Let them think that then. It doesn't matter.
[name="Leontuzzo"]Even if they do think it's a show, sometimes, the willingness to put on a show is already a gesture in its own right. Don't you think?

[name="Lavinia"]......
[Character(name="avg_427_vigil_1#7$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#5$1",focus=1)]
[name="Leontuzzo"]Anyway, Lavinia, that's what I think.
[name="Leontuzzo"]We haven't accomplished anything big just yet.
[name="Leontuzzo"]One day, we'll end up mistrusting each other.
[name="Leontuzzo"]One day, when we come to our senses, we might realize that we've been misguided all along.
[name="Leontuzzo"]But...

[name="Lavinia"]Leontuzzo Bellone, what is it that makes you stand here so resolutely?
[name="Lavinia"]You were born into a famiglia, yet now, you've become the famiglie's worst enemy. Why?
[Character(name="avg_427_vigil_1#6$1")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]Why, huh... I ask myself the same question a lot.
[Character(name="avg_427_vigil_1#1$1")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]Is it my idea of chasing efficiency?
[name="Leontuzzo"]Was I raised on ideals of justice?
[name="Leontuzzo"]Is it because of the actions of an admirable government official?
[name="Leontuzzo"]Is it a conclusion from a minor observation of changes in the famiglie?
[Character(name="avg_427_vigil_1#7$1")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]Maybe all of the above.
[name="Leontuzzo"]If we put all these reasons together, we might be able to come up with an answer––

[name="Leontuzzo"]The time has come.
[name="Leontuzzo"]Maybe Carracci avoided assassination and became a successful Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici, working hard towards a similar goal.
[name="Leontuzzo"]Maybe Ministero Rubio chose to show restraint and continued to occupy his position, secretly winning people over with his lofty ideals and striving to bring change to Siracusa.
[name="Leontuzzo"]This wasn't some elaborate plan I've been hatching my whole life. It suddenly dawned on me at some point, and I only made it this far on luck.
[Character(name="avg_427_vigil_1#7$1")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]If I die, there'll be someone who comes after me, and another man after that.
[name="Leontuzzo"]And none of this is a testament to how hard I work or how unique I am. It just means that––
[name="Leontuzzo"]The time has come for Siracusa to change.
[Character]
One question after another is thrown at Leontuzzo, the entire court filled with voices interrogative and vitriolic.
He stands in the center of the courtroom, earnestly and tirelessly answering every question he deems worthwhile.
Slowly but surely, more and more people begin to think that this young man is actually quite thoughtful, and that––
He's serious.
In the end, the courtroom's entire atmosphere seems to cower before him.
[Character(name="avg_427_vigil_1#7$1")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]All the jurors present, all the civilians watching, and all the people tuning in through various media.
[name="Leontuzzo"]Until now, my heart has been filled with uneasiness.
[name="Leontuzzo"]I borrowed this city from Signora Sicilia, but never saw it as something that belonged to me.
[name="Leontuzzo"]I borrowed this city from Signora Sicilia so we could work together to build something completely new, for all of you to work towards a Siracusa free from the famiglie.
[name="Leontuzzo"]Because I made that decision on everyone's behalf, I must also face everyone's judgment.
[name="Leontuzzo"]But, if you'll let me make a single grand statement–
[Character(name="avg_427_vigil_1#1$1")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]At this moment, Siracusa doesn't have the right to judge me.
[name="Leontuzzo"]And so, I can only be judged... by all of you.
[name="Leontuzzo"]You will receive this right, just as if you had won the power to build an entirely new city.
[Character(name="avg_427_vigil_1#8$1")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]Maybe one day, at one point in the future, the power to determine Siracusa's future will also lie in your hands.
[name="Leontuzzo"]This new city welcomes all of those dissatisfied living under the yoke of the famiglie and those who have their doubts, including doubts about me.
[name="Leontuzzo"]That's all I wanted to say.
