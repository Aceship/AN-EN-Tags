[name="Pallas"]Of course, of course. I should be candid in the presence of friends.
[name="Pallas"]Mr. William, I'd like to bring my work to the Victorian market. The materials for this perfume are by and large no issue, but the most important ingredient, a kind of tree, formerly could only be found in Minos.
[name="Pallas"]Perhaps it was some will from Above, that I should have found the same tree in this city too. Do look, please.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="William"]This leaf is your main ingredient, then?
[name="William"]Definitely has a unique scent about it. In a perfume, it'd bring more overall calmness, classicalness. Unlike any wood-scented perfume on the market today.
[Character(name="avg_181_flower_1#1$1",name2="avg_482_pallas_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]A Minoan juniper. To find a mark of its growth in this city proves that it can adapt to this climate.
[name="Pallas"]Therefore, I wish to contract for a plot of soil in this city to plant them in bulk. But as a foreign merchant, the procedures pose me great challenges. Thus I hope you may lend me a helping hand in this matter.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="William"]I would like to say, that's easier said than done, even with my connections.

[name="Pallas"]Mr. William, since we are talking business, we may as well cut to the core. You needn't worry about this brand occupying your market. You need only be ready to aid me, and I will of course repay profits to you.

[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="William"]Hahaha... I could never. Ms. Lena and I are friends, and even if there was nothing in it for me, it's still right of me to lend an ear.

[name="Perfumer"]I wouldn't dare run my mouth. You're the connoisseur here, market-wise. As a perfumer, I can only give an evaluation of the work itself.
[name="Perfumer"]Wood-based perfumes have been fairly popular in recent years, and a 'taste of the exotic' easily sparks conversation. This perfume is no ordinary thing in itself, either. On the whole, it should be for you to judge, I think.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
