[name="Fang"]There were four who fled for Area 10 just now. If we wipe out the opposing forces here, we can prevent the other side from returning combat intelligence. It'll give us an incredible advantage for our second assault.

[name="Fang"]I'm sorry... I can't believe I'm the reason you got hurt.

[Character(name="char_193_frostl_1", name2="avg_123_fang_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Frostleaf"]Your judgment wasn't at all flawed, Captain. We were just slightly disjointed in that last mission, but we didn't lose any opportunity to carry out our search-and-destroy.
[name="Frostleaf"]Though it might seem extreme in hindsight, if we'd all gone on the offense together, we probably had sufficient strength to defeat them.

[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]It was a lapse in judgment with my command. I subconsciously... took my team members' combat styles to be those under simulated circumstances I knew better.
[name="Fang"]I had forgotten everyone's personal strengths by the time the mission started, and employed my habitual line of thought. I took it for granted and gave you the wrong assignment, Aciddrop.
[name="Fang"]Not just that, I even failed to clearly relay the plan to my team members... and caused everyone to spend even more energy on the mission.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Aciddrop"]I don't think you messed up at all just now, Captain. With the whole situation, putting me in charge of clearing the traps, and you and Frostleaf pursuing the enemy, that's solid tactics.
[name="Aciddrop"]Just didn't predict the enemy would still be on the counter after that. They really bit off way more than they could chew. I mean, you dealt with them all yourself.

[name="Fang"]Thank you, Aciddrop, Scene, Frostleaf... and Lens, too.
[name="Fang"]In all honesty... I believe that when it comes to team operability, A1 doesn't fall short against other reserve detachments.

[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]Yes... Before Beagle, Kroos and I came to Rhodes Island, we were an intern team at a Columbian garrison.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Aciddrop"]That's some major force. All I ever had on the brain was skateboarding, back in Columbia. Only realized after hitting Rhodes Island, hey, when that old police guy taught me those crossbow techs? Actually got a use for those.

[name="Aciddrop"]Heheh, you think so? It's not my first time getting a combat scrape, though. Always easy to lose track and get hurt, and I get my captains keyed up all the time with it.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]You'll improve with experience.
[name="Fang"]A1's been through a lot of combat training.
[name="Fang"]With how we've worked each other out, we've devised a set of handy signals only we understand.
[name="Fang"]They give me the time and space to judge a situation. That gives me the opportunity to command as a captain. But...
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Aciddrop"]But?
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]To tell the truth, this is my first time directing combat as an official acting team leader...
[name="Fang"]I don't know why I've been unable to adjust my plans or instructions... I haven't just failed to make my orders understood, I've given the wrong orders to the wrong teammates.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1#5",focus=2)]

[name="Lens"]You possessed the ability to rapidly locate the enemy's vital points on the front line, and were exceptionally brave in leading your charge to open the way for us.

[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Aciddrop"]And besides, the way you lead A1 to victory out there in battle, and then come back and have such a great, friendly relationship, that all shows what a great captain you are.
[name="Aciddrop"]I mean, it's not like everyone's lucky enough to get set up in an reserve op team. Like me, I'm such a free spirit they won't even give me the chance.
[name="Aciddrop"]So buck up, Captain Fang.
[name="Aciddrop"]Nobody thinks you gave the wrong orders. You're just hung up on doing better.
[Character(name="avg_npc_145", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lens"]If you would like to change, then learn from your failures. You definitely have what it takes to find a solution.

[name="Fang"]Huff... puff...
[dialog]
[delay(time=2)]
[name="Fang"]I got it.
[name="Fang"]I'll keep working hard to be a good captain, but I hope you will all keep giving me suggestions on how to improve.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Aciddrop"]Well... Like, I guess I didn't really get why you went rushing on ahead, and it sorta freaked me out?
[Character(name="avg_npc_145", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lens"]Aciddrop, I think what you are trying to say is the captain should 'improve communication.'
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Aciddrop"]Yeah, that!
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]Right... so I need to give clear and concise commands...
[Character(name="char_193_frostl_1", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Frostleaf"]Yes, communication is important. You act and react decisively, but it's important to make sure everyone can keep up.
[Character(name="char_193_frostl_1", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]Get a plan in place and keep everyone safe...
[Character(name="avg_npc_145", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lens"]Battlefield command is very difficult, but crucial. There is no doubt you have what it takes to be captain.
[name="Lens"]But we hope you will provide more encouragement to your teammates, such that they will have even more faith in you.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Aciddrop"]Yeah, like, beyond just training, you and the A1 girls do other stuff to build teamwork, right?
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]Hm... we do talk strategy, I guess. And we fight, and chat, and argue...
[Character(name="avg_npc_145", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lens"]You argue? That sounds like a rather intense pastime.
[Character(name="avg_npc_145", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]Yes, like at times like these, they'll be so caught up in themselves, I have to push them to rest, or they'll talk right through their break time...
[name="Fang"]We have thirty minutes until the next mission, so you should be resting up too. I'll wake you when it's time to move.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Aciddrop"]Wha? But I wanted to hear more about you and your reserve op team.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]We can't keep talking, you're wounded. You need your rest. Lay down, Aciddrop.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Aciddrop"]Ugh, fine. But after the mission, you've gotta gimme some real tight war stories, okay? I'm jonesing.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]Alright...
[Character(name="char_336_Scene_1")]
[name="Scene"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_145", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lens"]Miss Scene wants to ask if you have cheered up? She hopes that conversation was helpful to you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_145", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]Don't worry, Scene, or Lens. I just need a little alone time to think.
[Character(name="char_193_frostl_1", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Frostleaf"]Yeah... good call.

[name="Beagle"](And her tail's still flapping away. Fang really has so much energy.)
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1")]

[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#5", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]

[name="Fang"]Me?
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#4", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Grace"]Correct. I've gleaned a few things from conversations with the rest of A1. There are some concerns about your leadership.
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#5", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]I... I don't want to make anyone worry.
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#5", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Grace"]Anyone can see that A1 has grown a lot. When you're done with training, we'll break out the team members for temporary practical duty with other squads.
[name="Grace"]And you haven't been doing too badly as captain.
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#5", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]But... I almost never do that kind of temporary duty alone.
[name="Fang"]Hibiscus, Kroos, and Beagle all had great temporary duty runs, and Lava gets out there on real missions, everyone can see how well she does alone.
[name="Fang"]But me? I may be captain, but I only pull it off with my team's support.
[name="Fang"]I mean, I sometimes think it'd be fine to just keep on leading A1, as selfish as that is...
[name="Fang"]I wish A1 could stay together, but I know everyone has their own futures ahead of them. I... I know we have to move on.
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#5", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Grace"]Yes, well, your teammates have all talked about how you feel. They know your sense of responsibility and duty.
[name="Grace"]And honestly, it's important for your feelings to get through to your teammates.
[name="Grace"]I've been around the block enough that I can tell you Rhodes Island's training regimen isn't just about getting your combat scores up.
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]Right, I know!
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Grace"]Instructor Dobermann always talks about how she wants Rhodes Island Operators to be strong and steadfast in battle, but also... to never blind themselves to the cruelty of war, to keep a beating heart.
[name="Grace"]Never see yourself as a pawn on the board.
[name="Grace"]What that means, Fang, is a lot more opportunities for you, not only for Rhodes Island to trust in your strength, but to refresh yourself.
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#4", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]Re...fresh myself?
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#4", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Grace"]Your A1 teammates recognize your strength, they trust in you. The understanding you have is unmatched.
[name="Grace"]Trust in yourself, but also trust in the idea that, no matter your teammates, no matter the odds, you can find a way to achieve the goal before you.
[name="Grace"]No one person is perfect, but two, or three... when they converge, the power in the center grows, maybe at the cost of some differences and disagreements.
[name="Grace"]I'm always pushing you one step further, Fang. Go make yourself into the leader who can guide that power in the center.
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#3", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]Instructor...
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]...Yes. I... I won't give up.
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Grace"]Not everyone can handle the burden of command.
[name="Grace"]Alright. Believe in yourself. And remember that feeling you had today when you dove in there. You can do it.
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]Um... But, Instructor Grace... I kinda feel like hearing this stuff from you... it's weird.

[name="Grace"]Ahaha... is it a little different from my usual style?
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#3", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]Not exactly, it's just... a little more... professional? Than usual!
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#3", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Grace"]Ah, you know me too well. And I think you can guess who's really telling you this stuff.
[name="Grace"]But even if 'she' isn't here to speak up and tell you herself, she definitely hopes you can get that courage and confidence from somewhere.
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#7", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]Alright! I got it!
[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1#7", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Grace"]Okay, go rest up. You'll have your first solo temporary duty assignment soon.

[Character(name="avg_123_fang_1", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]

[name="Fang"]I revised my plan based on our previous engagement. Here's your copies to review.
[name="Fang"]Taking our previous experience into account, I think we'll want to take a more aggressive stance.
[name="Fang"]Lens and Scene need to stay secure, keep our communications unobstructed. The front line needs clear maps and imaging.
[name="Fang"]Aciddrop, we still want you on the high ground for covering fire. But don't spread out too much, we want you close.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=1)]

[name="Frostleaf"]Roger.
[Character(name="avg_npc_145", name2="avg_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]Lens's terrain imaging needs to get to team two as quickly as possible. The other team can then move to support us.
[name="Fang"]Once we break through the first enemy line, we'll direct the supporting fire.
[name="Fang"]That's all we've got for the plan before we move. Once we reach Area 10, listen for my orders.
