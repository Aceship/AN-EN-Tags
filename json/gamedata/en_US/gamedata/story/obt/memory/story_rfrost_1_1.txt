The hunter holds her breath and waits, finger on her trigger.
In her sight is a fowlbeast, wandering back and forth in the forest, leaving one footprint after another in the snow.
It too is a scavenger, seeking other life to allow its own to persist in this harsh environment.
It seems to have seen something, standing its slender neck straight, sharp beak aimed towards its prey.
In one and the same instant, it spreads its wings, and the hunter pulls the trigger.

[name="Old Sarkaz Hunter"]In the end, I accompanied that cursed, vile beast as it found that caster. Indignantly, it asked: 'Where, after all, is my home?'
[name="Old Sarkaz Hunter"]'All beings have an origin. Since they have an origin, there must be a place they are born. Yet why do I not? Could it be my existence was never meant?'
[name="Old Sarkaz Hunter"]The Caster answered: 'This is the rule of the curse. You exchanged your home for wisdom, and the power to make all people fear. But now you forever lost your home; true, you should not exist!'
[name="Old Sarkaz Hunter"]The beast was full of anger, and desired to savage the Caster to death. But still it calmed down.
[name="Old Sarkaz Hunter"]Revenge was of no avail. It would not solve the contradiction its own existence posed. And an irrational existence is preordained to disappear.
[name="Old Sarkaz Hunter"]Finally, the cursed beast chose to run, incessantly. So long as it never stopped in any one place, no part of this land would come to mean 'home,' nor 'away' to it, anymore.
[name="Old Sarkaz Hunter"]How wise of the beast, to solve the crisis of its own existence so. However, I had no energy to continue to run with it. I could only choose to stay in my little wood hut, and while away the rest of my days.

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_053",focus="l")]
[name="Old Sarkaz Hunter"]More than enough. To the point my life could have ended at any point, and it would be no regretful thing.
