[name="Swire"] Hello, Master Wei.
[character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1#5")]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Take a seat.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Officer Swire, there is something we must discuss.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Oh? Well, that's a new one. We've never had a discussion, just the two of us, have we?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] You might want to get used to it, then.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] ......
[name="Swire"] So Officer Ch'en isn't coming back?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] No, she isn't.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] There are a lot of superintendents in the L.G.D. Why me? The things Officer Ch'en did, I might not...
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] You needn't do what 'Officer Ch'en did.' She was never the ideal choice to lead the Special Inspection Unit.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Master Wei? Just because Officer Ch'en is gone doesn't mean you're free to speak ill of her.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] I don't mean to speak ill. However, Officer Ch'en's strongest merit is her sense of justice, and that is also her greatest weakness. Her position called for more than a sense of justice.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Did it? Hm... Let me think... What else could you expect from me?
[name="Swire"] Good relationships stakeholding factions? A talent for command? A new face from the next generation? A bad relationship with Officer Ch'en? You wouldn't be after my family, right?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] You speak your mind, Swire.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] I've never been one to beat around the bush. I'm not my grandfather, Master Wei.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] And here I thought you'd avoid the word 'Grandfather.'
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] There was a time when I did, though I've since gotten used to it. He casts a long shadow in the L.G.D., and there's no running from the name 'Adams Schwire' as long as I live here.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Hah... I can't recall hearing an ordinary Lungmenite say his name. Perhaps it's not Lungmen that can't run from it, Officer Swire. It's you who can't escape the name.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] ......
[name="Swire"] Let's cut to the chase, Master Wei.
[name="Swire"] I know the current L.G.D. Commissioner is one of his lackeys, no matter how solid his relationship with you. I also know that the longer my grandfather stays in his sickbed, the more uncertain things get.
[name="Swire"] My family has had its differences with you, even before my grandfather got sick, but we always knew that the Corporate Union and Lungmen should and must coexist.
[name="Swire"] Now that my grandfather has been bedridden for fourteen years and counting, though, things have gotten far too chaotic and stupid with the men supposed to carry out his will.
[name="Swire"] If they continue this way, what will become of the relationship between the Schwires and Lungmen by the time he finally shuffles off his mortal coil? This is a problem you have to face, Master Wei, just as the L.G.D. must.
[name="Swire"] And maybe... It's one that I have to face too.
[name="Swire"] Am I right?

[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] That's a provocation, Master Wei. I resent the idea that anyone would see a single trace of him in me.

[name="Swire"] No... It's alright.
[name="Swire"] I've been thinking I might have to talk to you about this sooner or later, if I ended up taking over for Ch'en.

[name="Swire"] Childhood memories tend to be blurry, and they say that if you have one that's particularly clear, it must've had a profound impact on your personality.
[name="Swire"] So then, if I remember this so vividly even now, does that mean it was the first time I truly came to 'know' my grandfather?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] If my memory serves me right, your father is Adams's oldest son, and your grandfather had high hopes for him in his younger years... Hoh... Indeed, that's just like Adams.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] It doesn't seem like you grew up in the same kind of environment he did, though.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] My parents moved out of the place many years ago, after all. I could count the number of times I've met my grandfather on one hand. When my he wasn't around, my parents treated me well.
[name="Swire"] Though... in another sense... I have always lived in his shadow.
[name="Swire"] 'Don't do that, Grandpa said.' 'Don't play with them. Grandpa wouldn't like it.' —All the things I wasn't allowed to do when I was little, they were all because of 'Grandpa's wishes.'
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] —Not that I ever listened to him much.
[name="Swire"] I cried, I got angry. I even asked, 'Why am I not allowed, just because Grandpa wouldn't be happy about it?' My parents were never able to give me a reason, but I could tell. They were much more afraid of him than I ever was.
[name="Swire"] They weren't even trying to get on my grandfather's good side. They were just afraid of making him angry.
[name="Swire"] In the end, my grandfather was the thing I feared most at the time. He was like... just like a monster that ends up killing the heroes in a B movie.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Who would show their child something like that?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] I saw one once, and it kept me up all night. When I told my parents, '*Sobs* That ghost's scarier than Grandpa—' I got an earful from my father.
[name="Swire"] Then, I started to think: Oh, so Grandpa's actually scarier.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] ......
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] It doesn't sound so bad just listening to the story, does it? Believe me, though. It wasn't easy to live through. There was a time when I thought of 'angering Grandfather' as the red line that could never be crossed.
[name="Swire"] But some time after that...

[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] I was actually baffled. You see, my cousin had just told me a few months prior that he was the first in line to take over.
[name="Swire"] But when he said it, something felt off to me.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] The heir to the Schwire family fortune... Shouldn't that be...?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Correct, neither me nor my cousin. It should have been my father.
[name="Swire"] This is one of those questions that I could never wrap my head around when I was a kid, and then one day, after I'd grown up, I suddenly realized that it couldn't have been any simpler.
[name="Swire"] —Of course, my father didn't want to take over, and my grandfather never thought of him as a successor.
[name="Swire"] He's always called me the heir to the Schwires. Maybe that's his honest belief, but looking back...
[name="Swire"] He was probably just thinking something like: 'As long it's not me, it doesn't matter who it is.'
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] At the time, I still trusted my father, though. Or maybe I should say... even if they have their doubts, there aren't a lot of kids out there who don't trust their parents.

[name="Swire"] ......
[name="Swire"] Yes, you're right. I had a terrible time after that. Every so often, someone would bring it up.
[name="Swire"] A year or two later, though, I suddenly realized something.
[name="Swire"] By then, my grandfather was already pretty quiet on his sickbed... He wasn't even awake much, actually. Nevertheless, I still lived in his shadow.
[name="Swire"] Actually, even before that, I rarely saw him actually giving orders.
[name="Swire"] So how did he cast that shadow anyway? Did it come from my grandfather? From my father, my relatives? Or was it actually cast... by my own heart?
[name="Swire"] He barely said a word the year after he was bedridden. How come nobody dared to stand up against him? He didn't actually hold much power, but no resisted him. Why?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Forgive me, Officer Swire... but you don't seem like the type to ponder these matters at age thirteen or so.

[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] To tell you the truth, I was only muddling along back then. I didn't think, much less notice what was really on my mind.
[name="Swire"] If it wasn't for the cop who saved me, my guess is I would probably be just another loafing, good-for-nothing rich kid.
[name="Swire"] I still have the badge he dropped during the kidnapping case. If I ever find him, I'd really like to give him a proper thank you...
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] If you ask me, becoming a superintendent is the best way to show your appreciation.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] I suppose so.
[name="Swire"] Anyway, I went to Victoria to for school, basically because I was trying to get away from Lungmen.
[name="Swire"] I thought that, by going to Victoria, I could finally escape my grandfather's shadow. Boy, was I wrong.
[name="Swire"] I should've known... The Schwires have far more assets in Victoria than Lungmen.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Right, that's why, by going to Victoria, I actually managed to suss out my grandfather's position a little. It was like I finally found some of the answers to all the doubts that had been lingering in my mind.
[name="Swire"] I guess... there are a lot of ways to grasp power, but there is only one way to maintain that power, and that's to be right.
[name="Swire"] My grandfather could buy dignity with his power, but when he lost the ability to use that power, no one dared to turn on him, and there's only one reason why that is: He's always right.

[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] ......
[name="Swire"] My grandfather has done a lot right, there's no arguing that. But sometimes, there's more than one 'right' in this world.
[name="Swire"] What's right for the Schwires isn't necessarily what's right for Lungmen, what was right before isn't necessarily the right way forward, and what used to be right for my grandfather definitely isn't going to be right for me.
[name="Swire"] The thought of betraying my family has never crossed my mind. And the idea of betraying Lungmen is even crazier, because I won't ever betray my badge.
[name="Swire"] That's my answer, Master Wei. I'll leave it there for now.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Heh... You can keep going.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Where was I...?
[name="Swire"] Oh, I learned a little about my family's past during secondary school, and that was when I realized how my grandfather had planned everything so carefully when he moved the family business out of Victoria.
[name="Swire"] He predicted Victoria's troubles and fissures over forty years ago. He knew Victoria's fall was coming even at the height of its prosperity.
[name="Swire"] And then, even though nobody understood his decision, he stubbornly pressed forward until history finally proved him right.
[name="Swire"] And also... fine, I'll stop singing his praises. I'm sure you know more about his exploits than I do anyway.
[name="Swire"] Anyway, I'd be lying if I said I never wavered during this whole process. Though I came to understand that all this... didn't actually make me fear him any more.
[name="Swire"] In fact, the more I learned about his achievements... the weaker my fear became.
[name="Swire"] All because I couldn't figure out the source of my fear.
[name="Swire"] Back when I didn't understand anything, my grandfather cast a dark shadow, shrouding even the sky itself. The depth of his terror was limited only by my imagination.
[name="Swire"] But when I finally understood the source of his power, he was only as terrifying as the bounds of reality. I know why there is no standing up to him, and that's how...
[name="Swire"] That's how I figured out how to stand up to him.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] And that's that... but I didn't actually mean to backstab anyone, you know?!
[name="Swire"] They call me 'unseemly' day in and day out, like everything I do is some kind of dig at them. What's that about?!
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] That hotheadedness runs in your family. Surely you know that?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Of course I do, and that just makes me all the more pissed! Why do I have to take over the family business and have them prickling at me day after day? What's wrong with the L.G.D.?!
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] ......
[name="Wei Yenwu"] I've long heard rumors of the L.G.D. Officer Swire with her booming voice that echoes loud and clear. It seems the rumors are true.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] ......?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Ahem. Anyway, I figured at the time... running away won't solve anything.
[name="Swire"] If I kept running away, then even if I managed to become a cop, I might still shudder in fear every time my thoughts turned to my grandfather.
[name="Swire"] What's more, he'd see me running. And that would only lend more credence to his idea that I'm an unseemly granddaughter.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] No, thank you.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] And that is why, starting your third year of university, you began to take on work in the family business—even if it was in direct opposition to your parents' wishes.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Right... Now that you mention it, they grumbled about that for quite a long while. No matter. Who cares what they think?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Hmm...

[name="Wei Yenwu"] In 1092, the Schwire Group's Lungmen headquarters issued an order to its real estate officer in northern Victoria to sell off some of their properties there.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] The director refused the order and submitted a report describing why the order was not feasible.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Working through a classmate, you got your hands on certain internal data from the dukedom in question and pointed out errors in the report. That was the first time you meddled in your family's business.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] However, the officer very quickly submitted a second report and plugged all the holes you found.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] In the end, the plan to sell off the properties did not succeed.

[name="Wei Yenwu"] In 1094, you came back to Lungmen, and while you were interning at one of your family's companies, you found out a director trying to get the Corporate Union and Lungmen to turn on each other.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] And you picked a fight during a meeting.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] In the end, the director's plan was foiled, and the individual was relieved of duty. However, you also had to leave the Schwire Group.

[name="Wei Yenwu"] 1095. That was your first year with the L.G.D. The Lungmen Trade Union held a strike over a wage dispute. The Corporate Union asked the L.G.D. to end the strike.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] In private, you arranged for a meeting between the Trade Unionists and the Corporate Union, though it fell apart. You couldn't stop the strike, and you ended up in a huge row with the Commissioner.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Following that, during a Schwire family meeting, your cousin accused you of damaging the Corporate Union's profits, though you fought back, and you did not find yourself more ostracized.

[name="Swire"] Why are you recounting my life story, Master Wei?! I know I didn't accomplish much during those few years, but growth happens over time!
[name="Swire"] Look at how much I've done lately!
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] I'm not trying to make fun of you, Officer Swire.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Do you remember what you said earlier? You asked me what more I expect from you.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] You're wrong to question yourself. This is what I expect to see in you. What the L.G.D. looks to uphold is not justice.
[name="Wei Yenwu"] You've been working to accomplish everything I want out of the L.G.D. You will experience even more failures than you did those few years, but just as you've never given up before, you won't give up now.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Understood.
[name="Swire"] Master Wei... I'm just thinking... whether I can accomplish the task at hand isn't actually that important.
[name="Swire"] What matters is this is the only way I can find courage, and win the right to choose my own path.
[name="Swire"] ......
[name="Swire"] I think I have a pretty good idea of what my grandfather thinks of me being a cop—'You don't have what it takes to devour the L.G.D., so why are you even doing this?'
[name="Swire"] —Maybe something like that? I don't really care anymore, though... Definitely. I don't care. Who cares what he thinks?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] You don't care? How did you manage such a flawless impression him, though?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Oh... I mean, I've been fixated on this since I was a kid. I can't completely not care!
[name="Swire"] ......
[name="Swire"] I'm sure you can tell. In recounting my childhood to you, I'm pledging my loyalty.
[name="Swire"] But now I know. You've seen what I've done these past four years... No, maybe you've been keeping an eye on me since even before that.
[name="Swire"] My actions thus far say much more about my position and how I feel than mere words. And when I say that, I guess it makes this conversation seem kind of meaningless.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Not necessarily... It's true that I used to see Adams in you.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Not that you look anything like him.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Hmm... Actually, even now, I can't say for sure he never influenced me. After all, I know in my heart that I actually do care what he thinks.
[name="Swire"] That said... Master Wei, are you willing to have a little faith in me?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"] Hmm...
[name="Wei Yenwu"] It's just as you said. Actions speak louder than words.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1", name2="char_2005_weiyw_1", focus=1)]
[name="Swire"] Well, then... You won't be disappointed.
