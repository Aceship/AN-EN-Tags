[name="Catapult"]Why let go of the good days, and risk it all on this?
[character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="avg_npc_217",focus=2)]

[name="Catapult"]Whatever. We're way past that, now. Let me be real with you.

[name="Catapult"]Under the geezer, as long as we do what we're told, we get everything taken care of, and we get a little allowance. And sure, maybe a whole lot consider those fine days to live.
[character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="avg_npc_217",focus=1)]
[name="Catapult"]But I just couldn't stand it anymore. Everything that happens everywhere pisses you off. That life grosses me out, down to the core.

[character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="avg_npc_217",focus=2)]
[name="Patrolling Knight"]So you did it for all the civvies who couldn't pay taxes...

[name="Catapult"]Yeuch, don't make me out like some kind of beacon of righteousness. I'm not THAT good-hearted.
[character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="avg_npc_217",focus=1)]
[name="Catapult"]I wasn't counting on doing something for anyone else's sakes. Blowing that geezer's vault open, dumping everything in there everywhere, that was all just me channeling my revenge.
