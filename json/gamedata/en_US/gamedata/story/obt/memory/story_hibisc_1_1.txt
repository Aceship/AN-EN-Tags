[name="Closure"]As for the private message you sent... Well, it's not like I <i>can't</i> pull some strings to get a sweet discount on this type of equipment...
[name="Closure"]I just wanted to double-check that you really think this is necessary.

Hibiscus! I've called you three times already! How long is this gonna take, seriously? The guys from A1 are gonna break down my door if you don't get back to me!
Anyway, I wanted to say it's really impressive how you got the situation under control in such a short time. And on your first field mission, too. You even got Edgar to buy the new machines.
Patience, professionalism, sticking to your guns, predicting the client's needs... We should work together on a business venture some time.
Seriously though, come back soon! We're holding a party to celebrate your success and we need the guest of honor!
