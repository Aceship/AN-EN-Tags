The officer stops pushing the cart loaded with wine and lifts his head to scan the courtyard in front of him.
Chengnan Bladesmiths, the most reputable bladesmiths in Yumen. The Patrol Battalion contracted them to produce much of their military equipment. Its owner, Meng Tieyi, is also a good friend of both the Lord Exorcist and the Grandmaster.
On days when they are off duty from the garrison, they often gather at the workshop with warriors from all over to spar, drink, and share stories.
He, too, comes every now and then, but something is different about the courtyard here todayâ€”
A few dozen bricks by the gate have been removed, and a old pagoda tree has been planted in the resulting pit. With its branches extending in all directions, it has taken up a considerable amount of space in the courtyard.
The tree's trunk is as wide as two lovers sharing an embrace. The grooves on its bark are lightly covered in small grains of sand, and coarse like an old man's palm.

The officer can tell it belongs to the heroine who often sits by the Grandmaster's side. He has no idea when she joined the celebrations. She is sitting opposite the Grandmaster this time, so he can only see her from behind.
No one knows what she came to Yumen for. All they know is that she is on very friendly terms with the Grandmaster, the Lord Exorcist, and Master Meng. Supposedly, she and the Grandmaster had a friendly bout togetherâ€”it takes a fight to truly know one another, or so it is often claimedâ€”and stayed afterwards.
All his brothers on the squad have sparred with her. They usually have nothing but good things to say about her, too. Her swordsmanship, her alcohol tolerance, her carefree and straightforward personality, and just how likeable she is overall.

He recalls how a decade or so ago, on the day he was first transferred to Yumen, the Grandmaster made an exception and paid the arena a visit.
Almost all the newly enlisted men had heard of the legendary Grandmaster, and he certainly did not betray their eager gazes.
Thousands of days and nights have come and gone across countless battlefields. Not once has Yumen's march through the sands come to a halt. Ten years have passed by in the blink of an eye.
He knows the Grandmaster's eyes. They never exert power nor radiance. More often, they are calm, with an unfamiliar-yet-comforting aura to those around him.

The workshop was closed yesterday, and the owner also forgot to keep the forge fires burning. The morning breeze sweeps through the courtyard and lands on the officer's face, immediately waking him from his wine-induced slumber.
His head still hurts, and all he remembers is how they had all raised their wine bowls to celebrate the Grandmaster's new name. Before long, one of the inebriated attendees began to sing a folk song from the barracks, and he teared up after a while.

It had only been a single night, but the old pagoda tree no longer feels out of place. Rather, it is the man standing underneath it whom the officer is surprised to see.
He tries to sneak away, only for the man to hear him.

[name="Centurion"]You saved me! During our last battle a few days ago!
[name="Centurion"]I was so focused on the bandit in front of me, I didn't notice the blade coming at me from behind. You fended it off for me.
[name="Centurion"]If it weren't for you, even if I'd achieved enough to be granted a promotion, it would only have been for dying gloriously in battle.

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_2024_chyue_1#3$1",focus="l")]

[name="Centurion"]No, that's not it...
[name="Centurion"]Thanks to you, I survived our last battle, but the injury I had before has been acting up a lot these past six months. The doctor told me my meridians will never heal up completely. This hand of mine won't be able to hold a blade for much longer.
[name="Centurion"]General Zuo has been very understanding. He's already given me permission to leave the army early. Once I'm finished packing, I'll be able to head home. I'll probably be gone by the end of the month.
[name="Centurion"]My old mother is still waiting for me, and I don't have any siblings. I've been in the army for over a decade, and I've never had the chance to go home and care for her, not even for a day.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_2024_chyue_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Chongyue"]How could this be...?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_796_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Centurion"]It's nothing, really. Even if I won't be able to hold a sword, I can still plow the fields with a hoe.
[name="Centurion"]The court is kind to us soldiers too. After I retire, I'll still have the same benefits as a centurion.
[name="Centurion"]...Grandmaster, I hope you won't mind me speaking my mind.
[name="Centurion"]When I found out I couldn't serve anymore... I really wasn't sure if I was ready to leave you, General Zuo, Yumen, and all my brothers behind... and I mean this from the bottom of my heart.
[name="Centurion"]I know we used to yell 'the yellow sands will bury us all together,' but I actually felt a little fortunate when I realized I could go home alive...
[name="Centurion"]And lately, I can't shake this thought either... Suppose I die on the battlefield. Even if my mother gets compensated for my death, how is she supposed to live out the rest of her life on her own?
[name="Centurion"]Do you perhaps... consider me a deserter?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_2024_chyue_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Chongyue"]Why would you think so?
[name="Chongyue"]Your injury is definitive proof that you have defended your homeland for years. What could give anyone the right to criticize you?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_2024_chyue_1#10$1",focus="l")]
[name="Chongyue"]And even in plowing the fields back home, you will still be serving our country by producing food.

A single leaf falls from the old pagoda tree. Having been replanted here from a hundred li away, even though the tree is now in a far superior environment, it has naturally yet to become accustomed to its surroundings.
The two men's lingering tipsiness draws them closer to one another. The officer glances at the man standing next to him.
He is the kind of man heard of only in legends, the kind of man one can only dream of laying their eyes on. Yet the man who stands beside him right now feels like nothing more than an approachable older brother.

[name="Centurion"]Everyone calls you the Grandmaster, but no one seems to know what your actual position is... We risk our lives together, but the court never seems to award you for any of your achievements.
[name="Centurion"]You have no family... and the heroine has been here in Yumen for so long too...
[name="Centurion"]Or perhaps it's because you have no equal under all of heaven, and the blades and arrows of the battlefield mean nothing to you, that you have no worries at all...
