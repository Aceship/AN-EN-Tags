Smoke and debris spill over the hills, scorching flames searing the land.
The helpless red dragon, locked upon its throne.
Threads pierce its bones – so that it may not move.
Originium splits open its flesh – so that it may not heal.
Cries fill its ears – so that it may find no rest.
A scepter nails the tip of its tongue, a crown binds its brain, and a stone orb crushes its spine.
It is a red dragon atop a throne, a puppet of the shadows.
It may not resist, beg for mercy, or escape.
Within its purgatory, the living statue weeps.
Tears drip from its eyes, flowing along the threads into its unhealing scars.
All it receives in return for its suffering and obedience is silence.
Bitter hail begins to fall from the sky—

Reed sits down on the bed, blankly staring at the door to her room.
Rhodes Island's standard-issue sliding door perfectly fulfills the task for which it was created, letting not even a speck of light through.
Of course, its sound insulation is also beyond question. Though, given that it is that time of day when people begin their daily activities, some noisy voices nevertheless reach Reed's ears.
This is exactly the life she dreamed of.
She need only open the door, and she would become a part of Rhodes Island too, living a life in the sunlight.

Every one of those souls, young and old, were always staring at her. It's all they can do now, harshly sting at her soul whenever her heart sways like a reed in the wind.
That's the only form of revenge left for the dead.

Before lying down, Reed moves her tail to the other side of the bed so that the burning flames will not affect the work of the Medical operator.
The fabrics of the bed are made from special materials so she doesn't have to worry about inadvertently setting the entire room on fire.
Reed originally thought the medic would stare at her tail curiously and ask questions, but she simply stares at the notebook and her instruments, with no intention of making small talk.

So Reed lies face-up on the bed, casting her eyes towards the ceiling, her gaze slowly drawn to the light emanating from the ceiling lamp.
[name="Medic Operator"]That should do the trick... Next up is...
It is nothing more than an ordinary ceiling light. Upon closer inspection, she can see a ring-shaped bulb through the covering.
Like a Sankta's shining halo...
[name="Reed"]Do you know... where the Sankta who saved me is? I want to thank her...
[name="Medic Operator"]You were sent to Rhodes Island by a Victorian Vouivre and some Rhodes Island operators who were on a mission in County Hillock. I don't recall any Sankta being among them.
[name="Reed"]Did I misremember...?
Reed continues to look at the ceiling lamp. The light from that Sankta was so vivid in her memory, there should be no mistaking it.
[name="Medic Operator"]But I did hear that we lost an elite operator during that operation...
[name="Reed"]Elite operator...?
[name="Medic Operator"]She was a respected older woman. Though she rarely swung by Medical, the snipers who came by for treatment or just to get a physical always had something to say about her.
[name="Medic Operator"]They said that she was extremely patient, and that her revolver was even more accurate.
[name="Medic Operator"]If I recall, I think she was a Sankta...
[name="Reed"]What... was her name?
[name="Medic Operator"]Outcast... That's what they all called her...

Daily life suddenly blossoms so vividly before her, and it proves strange and foreign.
Some cordial pleasantries, a bit of noise stirred up by trivial matters, and some idle chatter to pass the time.
How long had it been since she experienced these things?
Reed holds onto her left wrist with her right hand and leans against the edge of the corridor, trying to hide her tail as best as possible to make herself less conspicuous.
How she craves to be a part of this life; to pick up a fountain pen, or to savor a soft drink.
But she is not allowed to.
The ghosts of the past still sit atop her shoulders, tearing away any hopes she might have for a better life.

The targets are here to be destroyed, and so the cycle continues – wait, be aimed at, confirm hit.
The victims are bound tightly to the target dummies, lamenting Reed's savagery until their lifeblood runs dry.
And so, this place ceases to be a training ground, and instead becomes an exhibition of her vile deeds.

Originally, these artifacts were stacked in a warehouse in the Integrated Bioprocessing Unit, along with other unclaimed items.
But everyone knows that some things will never be claimed, and only gather dust in the warehouse. Precious artifacts, fated to be eroded by time.
So they were placed into custom-made storage containers, and housed in a small room at the end of the warehouse.
It is a cemetery, made for the operators who have given their lives for the cause.
But there are neither flowers nor tombstones here.
Everyone keeps their voices down, for fear of disturbing the slumber of the deceased.
The same goes for Reed. She restrains her fire, trying not to allow the dancing flames to disturb the solemn atmosphere.
In front of each artifact compartment is a plume of light, and Reed follows the lights to identify the person sleeping there.

Here, silence is the most effective means of communication.
After a simple exchange of courtesies, the two pass each other by.
It is then that Reed sees the code name of the one the Doctor was mourning–
Ace.
Perhaps, it tells the story of another savior. Perhaps one day, someone will tell that story to her.
But not today.
She walks in front of Outcast's artifact compartment, bows slightly, then reflects upon the legacy she left behind on this land.
In the compartment lies a damaged gun chamber, and next to it lies a eulogy someone wrote for her–
