[name="Voice on Television"]...Let us turn our attention to the string of events that occurred at Arena No. 4 a few days ago.
[name="Voice on Television"]Renowned knight 'Razor' Zorn of the Silveredge Knightclub continued to unleash his relentless attacks and critically wounded his opponent, who has yet to regain consciousness.
[name="Voice on Television"]The prosecutor's office has brought multiple charges against Zorn, including aggravated assault and disorderly knightsports conduct. A court hearing is set to be held.
[name="Voice on Television"]The injured knight, Roth, is a rising new star in the Kazimierz Major.
[name="Voice on Television"]From the knightsports arena of a remote village, he climbed all the way up the ladder to the Grand Knight Territory, and has obtained excellent results in the recent preliminaries.
[name="Voice on Television"]According to his attending physician, it is highly likely that he will never regain his mobility. Sadly, this may be the end of the road for our fledgling young knight.
[name="Voice on Television"]Now for an interview with Roth's wife...

Throngs of fans surround the court's front door. The newly-acquitted knight waves his arms as he walks toward the crowd, like a hero returning in triumph.

[name="Voice on the Phone"]The chain of evidence was still somewhat crude, but going solely by the results, you've met our expectations. Very well done.

[name="Timid Woman"]Roth said... his greatest wish is to stand in the arena of the Major, and prove to everyone the glory and dignity that knights should have.
[name="Timid Woman"]He's always worked towards that...
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4032_provs_1#11$2",focus="l")]
[name="Deszcz"]Then you must not be very familiar with your husband's work.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_004",focus="r")]
[name="Timid Woman"]What do you mean...?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4032_provs_1#11$2",focus="l")]
[name="Deszcz"]I received some news that wasn't related to the case. Interested?
[name="Deszcz"]Two days before the match, the Goldhelmet K.C. transferred a sum of money to Roth's personal account. Then, a substantial amount was transferred <i>out</i> of that account.
[name="Deszcz"]This money was then transferred through multiple accounts in succession. In the end, it was all used to place a bet on Razor winning his match against Roth.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_004",focus="r")]
[name="Timid Woman"]How could that be...?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4032_provs_1#10$2",focus="l")]
[name="Deszcz"]I don't know the details of the deal between Goldhelmet and Mr. Roth, but it's not so hard to guess. As for Razor Knight, his involvement was an unfortunate accident.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4032_provs_1#1$2",focus="l")]
[name="Deszcz"]It seems your husband isn't the knight novel protagonist everyone makes him out to be. Although that does make him more relatable.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_004",focus="r")]
[name="Timid Woman"]No way... That's not the kind of man he is...
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4032_provs_1#1$2",focus="l")]
[name="Deszcz"]If not for the accident, do you know how much those 'lottery tickets' of his would've been worth, compared to the prize money for winning a match?

[name="Timid Woman"]......
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4032_provs_1#8$2",focus="l")]

[name="Deszcz"]There's only so much cake to go around. Everyone wants a slice, but this also means each faction only has a limited influence on the court. There's definitely a way to break through, we just need to find it.
[name="Deszcz"]That is, if someone is willing to stand up and declare war. As for the risks...
