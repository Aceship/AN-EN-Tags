––Crack!
In the distance, a newly-hatched fowlbeast is finally blown dry by the frigid wind. It opens its eyes and sees that it is inside a nest atop a cliff.
Its mother built the nest here to avoid predators.
But now, it faces a problem: before it learns to fly, the only way to secure food is by jumping down the cliff.
It trembles as it steps out of the nest, spreads its fragile wings, tries to let the wind support it, and then takes the plunge–
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=20, ystrength=20, vibrato=15, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
Bang! The wind blows it over, and it slams against the side of the cliff.
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=20, ystrength=20, vibrato=15, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
Bang! It continues to roll downwards, the sharp ice slicing through its body.
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=20, ystrength=20, vibrato=15, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
Bang! It crashes into the snow beneath, the hard and icy snow offering barely any cushion from the impact. It sways its neck slowly, trying to stand up and return to its mother before it freezes to death.
It walks past the carcasses of its brothers and sisters, and behind it, another fowlbeast steps forward.

The fowlbeasts are startled by the sudden noise. They flap their wings and fly out the window. Large swaths of feathers continue to drift by, obscuring Qanipalaat's vision.
As the feathers subside, his vision gradually becomes clear again.
Ding, ding. A bright-red knot hangs from a dead tree on the icefield. Its incomplete threads droop down, falling onto the snow.
Layers of footprints spread out like another great tree growing horizontally, the knot spreading along with its roots.
[name="Knot"]......
Qanipalaat recalls a story his mother told him.
How hemp is changed from plant to rope, how it was dyed, how it was woven by her and his father. How it was hung on the tree, and finally, how he clasped it in his hands as he braved through the wind and snow.
The knot trembles slightly, and Qanipalaat looks down at his hands.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_466_qanik_1#8$1")]
[name="Qanipalaat"]This knot was on my staff... Why is it here?
[charslot]
He stands on his tiptoes, removes the knot, and re-attaches it to the top of his staff.
Rainwater falls from the sky, nourishes the tree's leaves, and sinks into the swamp.
A crystal sleeps beneath the swamp. Qanipalaat looks down and sees his face mirrored across the ripples on the water's surface, his eyes covered by a soft feather.
[name="Crystal"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_466_qanik_1#8$1")]
[name="Qanipalaat"]I can't see my own eyes, but I know that yours and mine are... very similar?
[charslot]
Qanipalaat reaches down and scoops up the crystal. It splits into two pieces – one sinks back under the water, while the other he takes to embed in his staff.
Countless feathers swirl into the sky until he can no longer see anything, and can only hear a soft sound.
It is as if he is back home. As if his father and grandmother are softly lamenting that no trace of them remains there.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_466_qanik_1#6$1")]

[charslot]
Qanipalaat laboriously takes a step forward, holding on to the feathers covering his eyes. He hazily steps over dead branches, ice and mud, and extends his hand.
His hand grasps at air, yet it also feels like hugging a fistful of warm feathers. It fills him with warmth.
The knot and the crystal sparkle, as if they have something to say.
[name="Kindly Voice"]Qanik, your mother embedded this crystal into your staff for you. It will serve as your eyes. Do you still remember what I taught you?
[name="No Longer Grumbling Voice"]It means you can see past the wind and snow, find who you wish to find, and reach the destination you need to reach.
Qanipalaat clenches his hand and holds his staff tightly. His father and grandmother appear in the snow. The latter smiles at him, so tenderly, so kindly.
