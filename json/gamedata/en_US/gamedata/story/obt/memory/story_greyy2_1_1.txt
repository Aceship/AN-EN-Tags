[name="Office Operator A"]What he's doing is choosing to die! Out of all my friends from back then, I'm the only one who's an operator here and still healthy. Everyone else is working at factories in god-knows-where, catching Oripathy and dying before they know it.
[name="Office Operator A"]Do you know how it felt watching their ashes scattered from the nomadic cities?
[name="Office Operator A"]And him! He should've had more choices available to him!
[name="Office Operator A"]Even though he's Infected, he could've chosen another path, and lived out his life healthy and safe!
[name="Office Operator A"]I'm not Infected, and neither are you or Rita. As long as a war doesn't break out, we can look forward to a long life. I don't want to watch him die before me, just like all my old friends!
[name="Office Operator A"]I'm prepared, but I'm not *that* prepared. I'm just a normal guy who was born and raised in Bolívar, and I'm only working here to try to save a couple more Infected for the sake of those friends of mine.
[name="Office Operator A"]I'm not rescuing people just to watch them work themselves to death!
