[Character(name="avg_npc_167")]
[name="Stormeye"]As I stated in the report, she was unconscious near the safe house, barely clinging to life. She was covered in dust and sand, looking just like a desert Catastrophe victim.

[name="Stormeye"]Obviously, she followed me.

[Character(name="avg_npc_167")]
[name="Stormeye"]I performed a comprehensive cabin inspection, and didn't see anything out of the ordinary.
[name="Stormeye"]She suddenly appeared in the middle of the journey, and I can't even confirm that she had been hiding inside the aircraft.
[name="Stormeye"]If not for her poor physical condition at the time, she might've even hit me with that attack.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]According to our analyses, she possesses some form of invisibility-type Originium Arts. If you can provide any further details, we'll have an easier time handling her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_167")]
[name="Stormeye"]I'm sorry, Dr. Kal'tsit. I honestly don't have anything else to offer.

[name="Kal'tsit"]Now then, the next matter is yours, {@nickname}.
[name="Kal'tsit"]We tried to identify the ID cards she had on her person, but most of them are older than her – remnants from a regional conflict decades ago.
[name="Kal'tsit"]All we can tell from them is she has been active throughout most of Sargon. Beyond that, there's no deeper connection among those IDs.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The other angle of investigation arises from the weapon she was carrying. We can fairly conclusively say that her primary function mode is assassination.
[name="Kal'tsit"]She carried several small and delicate devices with a level of craftsmanship unlikely to be self-made.
[name="Kal'tsit"]But, Rhodes Island has no way to trace the weapons and poisons. Our intelligence networks have come up completely blank.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Similarly, assassinations are not uncommon in Sargon, so we can't link her activities with any specific event.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Finally, judging from her behavior since coming in contact with Rhodes Island, it might be difficult to get any information directly from her.
[name="Kal'tsit"]She has been awake for three days, but has continued to refuse the food and water we've provided.
[name="Kal'tsit"]If she's so fiercely loyal to her past, can we really reach a cooperative relationship with her?
[name="Kal'tsit"]––These are things for you to decide, {@nickname}. If you have time, you can go see her.
[name="Kal'tsit"]For Rhodes Island, she is an Infected first and foremost, and that has nothing to do with her past.
[name="Kal'tsit"]If she is willing to cooperate, then we can accept her.

[name="Dobermann"]You're right, Doctor. For the operators of Rhodes Island, a raid of this sort would not be impossible.
[name="Dobermann"]I also agree with putting some less-experienced operators into this drill. So they won't be completely caught off guard when encountering invisible enemies on the battlefield.
[name="Dobermann"]But there is one problem: we don't know anything about this assassin who goes by 'Manticore.'
[name="Dobermann"]You can't let her scribbles on a single piece of paper replace the formal application process, let alone serve as an application to participate in a combat exercise.
[name="Dobermann"]She still hasn't talked about her past, and the only information we have on her background is still vague.

[name="Dobermann"]Are you saying that once we win her over, she'll never betray–– I see now.
[name="Dobermann"]But first, how will Rhodes Island win her over?

[name="Kal'tsit"]When our operators have the ability to defend against her attacks, or even counter them, this mock battle will instead have the effect of demonstrating Rhodes Island's sincerity to her.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Just like how an assassin places a knife by the monarch's pillow to let the opposition know she has the ability to strike at any time, but simply chooses not to.
[name="Kal'tsit"]She should be able to get our meaning.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]Fine. I accept your proposal.
[name="Dobermann"]I'll arrange for a video recording of this exercise, to keep as part of her files.
[name="Dobermann"]Doctor, I trust you'll be able to get exactly what we need.
