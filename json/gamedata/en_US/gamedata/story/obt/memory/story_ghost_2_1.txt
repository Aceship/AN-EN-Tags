[name="Specter"]The scent.
[name="Specter"]Fluid without the scent of seawater. Foul nutritional fluid, or completely scentless distilled water. It maddens, drives mad.
[name="Specter"]The noise.
[name="Specter"]There is no singing. There is no dancing. Only an endless, drawn-out clamoring remains. A horrific murmur, bringing craze.
[name="Specter"]It's not all like that. Sometimes, in the momentarily returned quiet, there are voices to hear too. Clear voices.
[name="Specter"]...Is it 'I' who hears them? Not for sure. How should 'I' respond? Not important.
[name="Specter"]This ragged, dilapidated body... here and now lacks, beyond maintaining silence, any use.

[name="Skadi"]...She's...
[name="Skadi"]...Shark... no... Lauren... Laurentina!
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Don't rush, Skadi. You're far more familiar with her past than I am. But as for her present, you do not necessarily know her more thoroughly than I do.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I know you've been emotionally excited by the prospect of seeing one of your colleagues, but do not make contact with her. Her slumber is the product of tremendous effort.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#6")]
[name="Skadi"]Shark... Shark of the Second. It really is you.
[name="Skadi"]You're still alive... I'm not the only Abyssal Hunter still alive...
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Of course you're not.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]What do you mean...?
[character(name="char_263_skadi#8")]
[name="Skadi"]I wandered dry land for so many years, and she was the first one I ever saw. Rhodes Island, exactly how did you find her?
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]A deal, of no small cost, but thankfully enough for me to find out where the Church hid her.
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]When we brought her back, she still held the last of her clarity, but very rapidly fell into confusion.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]Shark... can you not hear my voice? You should still remember me... no matter if it's me with you, or you with me, there's still so much for us to talk about.
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]But in her conversations with us... while her confusion hasn't relapsed, she only calls herself 'Specter.'
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]'Specter?' She wasn't called that before. She's an Abyssal Hunter, one of the fiercest, cruelest 'executioners' of the Second...
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]But she is presently Specter. Infected, has fled the Church of the Deep, and proclaims herself 'Specter.'
[name="Kal'tsit"]Skadi, no matter her past, in her final waking moments, this is all as she told me. As to her capacity as an Abyssal Hunter, she mentioned not even a word.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]Why...?
[name="Skadi"]Shark... no, Specter. She was taken away by a church on the land? They must have carried out so many cruel experiments on her.
[name="Skadi"]They wanted to learn the secrets... Specter's secrets, the Abyssal Hunters' secrets. And you...
[name="Skadi"]Isn't that your reason too?
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]You know this is no easy topic. But exactly as per my attitude regarding you, the Abyssal Hunters' secrets are in no way the ultimate truth I seek to learn.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I regard Specter the same way. She is first and foremost my patient, and then one of Rhodes Island's personnel. As for anything priorâ€”anything she hasn't mentioned before, I have no need to investigate deeper.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]I want to ask... when she'll wake up.
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Keeping an empty nest only wastes time. That miniscule chance of a miracle is not something you'd be willing to stop in your own tracks for.
[name="Kal'tsit"]We are sustaining her life. Her outlook is neutral; whether or not she can recover entirely depends on her. Here on dry land, this is all we can accomplish.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]I'll come back.
[name="Skadi"]I want to meet her, speak with her, hear her singing. I've already... we've already been apart from our colleagues for far too long.
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Your and her callings, significances at Rhodes Island are not the same. But provided she awakens, Skadi, she should be able to address your and my confusions alike.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I hope... we won't have to wait too long.

[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]No harm in waiting. She's more familiar with Rhodes Island's other operators.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]I see now. Aaaaall you need is to make a deal with Dame Kal'tsit, and that's why she's the only one you got in touch with.
[name="Specter"]But I've been stuck in there for ages. There's so much that can take the same answer, and be done the same way.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]The situation is provisionally stable, but not completely secured. When the time comes, either myself or Skadi will be confirming whether we can take you back.

[name="Specter"]Hah. I'm not withered enough to collapse before I make it to Rhodes Island. Yet.
[name="Specter"]On that note, Captain, do you have any idea what kind of place it is? They don't even have auto-flush smart toilets!
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]I know.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]So I'm not aaaaall in a hurry to get back to that landship. Skadi's got her worries to settle, and we can chit-chat over ours.

[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]Saying this now might be way, way too late... But I can't help but say it. Captain, relax. I haven't leaked anything about us to anyone, not once, not ever.
[name="Specter"]Those Church idiots wanted to find our secrets. They tried prising open my mouth, digging the words out from inside my throat.
[name="Specter"]I wasn't willing. Then they went and thought to find any hint, whisper, indication from within my flesh, from inside my brain. But... you've seen where that got them.
[name="Specter"]They never got their wish.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]I saw. Were this the past, I would have to honor you... but at present, no one has the qualifications to do it for you, to officially and formally assess your conduct.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]No, Captain, you have those qualifications. Let's go back to the past for just a bit... we both have the memories to talk the talk.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]Very well, then. Shark... your judgment was proper. You protected our secrets with your life. Very well done.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]Heh... hah, hahah, that soothes me.
[name="Specter"]Nothing else from me, Captain. I suppose you got to know everything going on with me all by yourself. It's a stupidly drier tale than what you've dealt with.
[name="Specter"]I just want to know, actually. If it's not you skittering everywhere by yourself, but rather 'us' now...
[name="Specter"]The Abyssal Hunters, back together again. What will we get up to, then?
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]My mission has never changed. But, Shark, who are you now?
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]Me?
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]Those dry-landers aboard Rhodes Island all say it, let alone Dame Kal'tsit. Now, even Skadi calls you 'Specter.'
[name="Gladiia"]You have chosen to accept this identity, and have had no need to continue being 'Shark.'
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]I'm still same as ever, Captain... I do something when I can do it. I have others to think about the rest for me. I'm Laurentina, I'm Shark, and I'm Specter.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]Not a bad way to be.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]And is there nothing else? Captain, it's been so long since we saw each other, we've gone through so much. Why did it take so few words for us to become like we were before?
[name="Specter"]But you never did care about much. Same then, same now.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]There is something. But you have no need to recall it.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]Something you want to know? What is it, then?
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]When were you captured?
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]On dry land. I broke free of those monsters, chased up onto shore, and while I was totally spent, those 'spirits' clasped me.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]So... you ultimately know nothing of the remaining hunters who were dragged to the bottom of the sea.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]Right. Everyone scattered.
[name="Specter"]Captain, if all that remains of the Abyssal Hunters are us three now...
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]Even so, we are still Abyssal Hunters. Our blood leaves us no escape from it.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]That's true, I knew you'd say something like that. Believe me, I wouldn't run from my mission.
[name="Specter"]Weird. Who in the hell's Skadi meeting for this long of a chat? Sal Viento's turned into a real wreck these days. Like there's anything to keep her here.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]It seems of the Abyssal Hunters who walk on dry land, she has changed the most, and undertaken more besides.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#4", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]Landwalkers' emotions, hah. It stuns me how accustomed she is to living out of water. And all the connections she's worked up.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#4", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]Utterly meaningless. But to you, it is not a way of life necessarily ruled out, Shark.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]I get it, I get it. If they really can figure out how to cure my case of bad-mouth, I'll reconsider my lifestyle.
[name="Specter"]But right now, my top priority is to reminisce, shoot the breeze.
[name="Specter"]My weapon's duller than it was, my body's heavier than it used to be, and my reactions have slowed some too. If I'm going to be of real help to you, it'll take a bit more time.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]*sigh*... Forget it! Skadi's taking forever to come back anyway, so let's take a break. Oh, I'm dying to sing. Captain, who's going first?
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=2)]
[name="Gladiia"]Hmph.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#2", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]Through all those mad, chaotic, inescapable days of pain, I would've gladly even given up my ability to fight, if only I could just sing.
[Character(name="char_143_ghost#3", name2="avg_474_gladiia_1",focus=1)]
[name="Specter"]But in the end, shock and horror, that was the one thing I somehow couldn't do.

[name="Specter"]Also, how long has it been since we last fought together? That battle just now could hardly scratch the itch.
[name="Specter"]Even if... Fine, I can imagine facing off with land idiots won't take much effort. It probably wouldn't even leave the slightest wound.
[name="Specter"]You two. One only ever says what she has to, the other skirts and sidesteps and never wants to say what's weighing on her mind. You suffocate me, both of you.

[name="Closure"]Alright. I hope we can get everything out of you with these statements, and Rhodes Island will do all we can to respect your wishes.
[name="Closure"]Specter, when you first came to Rhodes Island, you did not make it in time to convey the message you wanted. Do you intend on conveying it now?

[name="Specter"]There's no need... Closure, is that what they call you? What I needed to convey, my colleagues have already come to learn.
[name="Specter"]As for the leftovers, though... I won't allow those strains that the church pawns planted in my will to flower, to spread those obscenities to places farther, wider still.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#3",focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]Alright. Next up, Rhodes Island took you in for treatment, and then with great caution sent you into field combat. Do you consider...
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#3",focus=2)]
[name="Specter"]I know all that. It was my own choice to fight. Dame Kal'tsit figured out that much, and I still need to give her a little thanks for that.
[name="Specter"]The battlefield... is a peaceful place. At times, the silent ruins are much quieter than all that medical equipment, constantly whirring away.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#3",focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]If, and I mean if, Specter, regarding recovery of your awareness... if we find a way to maintain your waking state to a certain degree, do you have any plans made for your future?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#2",focus=2)]
[name="Specter"]Plans? I've long since had those ready.
[name="Specter"]I was thinking about them on the trip back, even.
[name="Specter"]Why not invite the Captain and Skadi to form a team of three with me, go outside just for a spot of slaughter, and bully your useless land-dwelling punk idiots a little.
[name="Specter"]Skadi says after so long walking on land, she can tell apart the 'good' and the 'bad' in your hearts. With the Captain leading, we three are a complete army.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#2",focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]For sure, if we consider what we know of the Abyssal Hunters' strength...
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#3",focus=2)]
[name="Specter"]However, I haven't told them any of that.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#3",focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]Yes?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#3",focus=2)]
[name="Specter"]Dame Kal'tsit's warned me, and I've had inklings myself. This sanity is something that can't last for long.
[name="Specter"]A three-person team fails at the planning stage. My combat style is already totally unlike how it used to be. Rhodes Island, the tactics you currently choose for me seem to be the most optimal.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#3",focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]Before we can find a way to treat you...
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#3",focus=2)]
[name="Specter"]Forget it. All this dry-land technology of yours could only ever give me occasional peace.
[name="Specter"]The faults in my body... only I myself can sort them out. Anyone else? Hopeless.

[name="Closure"]......
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#2",focus=2)]
[name="Specter"]Hey, now, don't look like that, Closure. All I can do is remain at Rhodes Island. I count as one of you. When I want to hack someone apart, let me out to war, and it'll be a win for you too.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#2",focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]So, are you able to accept continued combat as a Rhodes Island Operator?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#2",focus=2)]
[name="Specter"]I told you, the battlefield is where I can find some peace and quiet inside my head. I can't work like I did as an Abyssal Hunter anymore, but aboard Rhodes Island, there are those who let me revel in the fighting front.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#2",focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]So you mean to say, our commander gives you effective instruction?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#3",focus=2)]
[name="Specter"]In fact, once I'm done with you, that is where I plan to go.
[name="Specter"]We've never talked while I was awake. I've got a few things I need to explain, quickly.
[name="Specter"]Rhodes Island's commanderâ€”the Doctor, is nothing like any of you.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#3",focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]You can tell.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#2",focus=2)]
[name="Specter"]When language can't reach, all the other senses become stronger as a result. If I want to continue fighting...
[name="Specter"]I must... bring the Doctor... to that place...
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#2",focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]Specter...
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_143_ghost#2",focus=2)]

[name="Specter"]Heheh. This is my first time talking to you awake...
[name="Specter"]Yes... awake. I am still awake right now, but I am also... somewhat fatigued.
[name="Specter"]Relax, Doctor. You are already used to this sort of conversation with me. Now, you may understand me even better.
[Decision(options="There's so much I want to ask you.;What are you willing to tell me?", values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[name="Specter"]Doctor... you have seen me before as I washed about, spoken with me.
[name="Specter"]If there were words then that you could not comprehend, do not... do not heed them.
[name="Specter"]Those madnesses should not be passed on, but it is beyond me to control it. Fortunately, I still have the right to silence.

[name="Specter"]Heheh, Doctor, there are so few who should be willing to try.
[name="Specter"]My one regret is, in that form, I am unable to sing. And I... the I of now, no longer have the voice for song...
[name="Specter"]Doctor... I will sing you a song.
[Decision(options="Why?;Alright.", values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[name="Specter"]I must sing it. And then... you have... some kind of power. I believe, after you hear this, you may be able to understand.
[name="Specter"]Doctor, I have met my colleagues. My captain... as Abyssal Hunters, we endured selection of the prime, elimination of the unfit, uncountable times.
[name="Specter"]Gladiia once commanded us to jointly resist that terrifying enemy... the darkness from within the ocean. She remains the same even now.
[name="Specter"]But I. I am the name 'Shark,' yet have become 'Specter.' Akin with Skadi, we carry the odor of dry land. We carry the scent Rhodes Island carries.
[name="Specter"]Doctor, in the times I cannot maintain wakefulness, I cannot swim together with my captain... my body has been implanted with makings of dry land, and I am forced only to crawl across this world.
[name="Specter"]I thirst, thirst to stand upon the battlefield, thirst to enter the sea, thirst to sing.
[name="Specter"]You are the tactical commander... on the battlefield, you know, the way in which I fight. Do not let me leave the battlefield for too long. That is my... evidence, that I live after others die.
[Decision(options="What should I do?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Specter"]Put even more danger upon my share.
[Decision(options="......;No.", values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[name="Specter"]Then let me a little closer to the enemy. Do not worry, Doctor, I'll be more obedient on the battlefield than ever before.
[name="Specter"]Do not fear my strength... simply keep far from me, what you do not want my saw to cut.
[name="Specter"]Fundamentally, an Abyssal Hunter's battle needs no surplus communication.
[name="Specter"]Worry not, Doctor. Break us in for a bit longer, and we will only become more familiar with each other, and the bindings of language... will have no meaning at all to fighters like us.
[name="Specter"]Should I trust you, commander of dry land?
[name="Specter"]To allow me to fight like an Abyssal Hunter, allow me to fight more and more... so that my faint consciousness returns to these hands of mine, power overflowing, weapon in their grasp?
[Decision(options="Specter.;......;Alright.;Trust in me, Specter.", values="1;2;3")]

[name="Specter"]Observe, Doctor, I still have so many 'secrets,' and I will be sure to tell them to you, before you go to that place...
[name="Specter"]But now, but now, just what ought I do...
