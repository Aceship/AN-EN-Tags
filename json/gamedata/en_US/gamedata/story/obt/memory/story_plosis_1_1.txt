[name="???"]  All of this information is consistent with our hypothesis.
[name="???"]  With these data on hand, Rhine Lab's newest results now directly correlate with the ancient Sarkaz legend. I don't think this is an accident.
[name="???"]  And if our hypothesis is verified, it will revolutionize everything we know about Originium.
[name="???"]  People think that Originium is a source of energy, a calamity; They think it can be used as a weapon, with only narrow applications outside of that. But the truth may be something far greater.
[name="???"]  If Originium really 'stores information,' just think about what that implies. From Originium, we will be able to read the story of this world, spanning hundreds or thousands of years, maybe even more...
[name="???"]  Does this really not pique your curiosity?
[name="Joyce"]  I've read all your previous reports already, and agree with your conjecture.

[name="Diary"]  I fell asleep in the cafeteria today. Gummy was worried about me.
[name="Diary"]  Dr. Silence reminded me that my 'narcolepsy' has gotten worse this month.
[name="Diary"]  There are more details in my physical examination report.
[name="Diary"]  The conclusion of the physical: 'Fatigue caused by long-term sleep quality issues.'
[name="Diary"]  Dr. Silence said that this was caused by the chip in my brain – Device #9.
[name="Diary"]  I am aware of these things. I know my own problems much better than those who worry about me, but I still must accept their concern.

[name="Diary"]  June 22nd, clear skies
[name="Diary"]  I went to see Mayer today to carry out some checks on the operation of Device #9 that I cannot carry out myself.
[name="Diary"]  Mayer brought up a troubling possibility. I've thought about it before, and have my own expectations.
[name="Diary"]  In other words, Device #9 has placed an enormous burden on my brain, and while this strain has not increased, my ability to withstand its impact cannot continue at its current level indefinitely.
[name="Diary"]  Della was a genius. Her accomplishments –– even if flawed –– must be protected.
[name="Diary"]  Device #9 does have a negative impact on me, and there's also the possibility of it malfunctioning. But had it not stabilized my prior brain disorders, I would not have had the opportunity to express these assessments.
[name="Diary"]  Furthermore, Della's invention also brought me many functional improvements. Some of these were expected even before the experiment, while others exceeded expectations.
[name="Diary"]  I can see the flow of Originium particles in the human body, and upon this, my understanding and control of medical Originium Arts have strengthened astoundingly.
[name="Diary"]  At the time, Della believed that not only was this due to a significant increase in the computational capacity of my brain, but also because of that, I was able to unlock a portion of Originium's functionality as an information pathway.
[name="Diary"]  That is what Device #9 is.
[name="Diary"]  Of course, it can have other uses... It can be used as a weapon. It can save people, and it can also bring destruction. Just like Originium itself, except more intuitive to use.

[name="Silence"]  I can't answer that question. It's outside the scope of my expertise.
[name="Silence"]  But the feedback data I've gotten from the monitor suggests your dreams are a side effect of Device #9.
[name="Silence"]  It might be reconstructing fragments of information you received when awake, and then playing them back repeatedly during your sleep.
[name="Silence"]  This 'playback' is one of the side effects of Device #9, in the same vein as the strong logical thinking it has brought you.
[name="Silence"]  Device #9 forces your brain to stay in a continuously stimulated state, which is also the source of your poor sleep quality as well as your 'narcolepsy.'
[name="Silence"]  As you know, Miss Dellareed's project was also full of holes. Most of the fundamental stipulations were built upon conjectures, and lacked evidentiary support.
[name="Silence"]  The basic principles of the experiment lacked solid ground, but they still had Miss Dellareed carry out that experiment. That's why you became what you are now.
[name="Silence"]  Internally at Rhine Lab, the experiment was considered a failure, and that led you to...
[character(name="avg_128_plosis_1#1$1")]

[name="Silence"]  Her death... had nothing to do with you. I don't have any right to blame her, but that tragedy was brought about by her obsession with her research.
[name="Silence"]  I've seen... far too many tragedies like that in Rhine Lab.
[name="Silence"]  Well, if it really is because of Miss Dellareed, I'm willing to have a chat with you. I'm sure Mayer would too.
[name="Silence"]  But I wouldn't fixate too much on that saying.

[character(name="char_134_ifrit_5")]
[name="Ifrit"]  Huh? Isn't it obvious? When she's happy, her eyebrows go up a little bit, her forehead is more relaxed, and the corners of her mouth change too.
[Character(name="char_242_mayer#3")]
[name="Mayer"]  How'd you figure that out?

[name="Diary"]  June 23rd, cloudy
[name="Diary"]  Dr. Silence told me that I am her friend. I am very thankful to her.
[name="Diary"]  Dr. Silence is a good person, but because of that, I don't want to make her life harder.
[name="Diary"]  She already carries too many burdens.
[name="Diary"]  Such as Ifrit's 'Diαbolic Crisis.' And the other problems she and Saria have to face.
[name="Diary"]  But... if my fate is already sealed...
[name="Diary"]  I hope Dr. Silence and Ifrit will have happy endings.
[name="Diary"]  My problems are very different from theirs, but they probably all stem from Rhine Lab's experiments.
[name="Diary"]  There are a lot of people like us at Rhine Lab.
[name="Diary"]  Outsiders think Columbian scientific research involves a lot of human experimentation.
[name="Diary"]  But that statement needs an addendum to be accurate. Many researchers are far too eager to carry out these experiments on themselves.
[name="Diary"]  ...and only a tiny number of them have happy endings.

A dream––
Joyce's dream is full of hallucinations and whispers, an illusory world full of things she does not understand.
She treks through these lengthy dreams day after day, and even if she doesn't understand them, these scenes have already become commonplace.
However, during this brief moment, she suddenly realizes that the dreamscape is becoming clearer.
[character(name="avg_128_plosis_1#6$1")]
The wending whispers by her ear turn to recognizable words and sentences.
The mist obscuring her vision is slowly dissipating as well.
[character(name="avg_128_plosis_1#1$1")]
She stands atop a lofty mountain, and gazes down at everything before her.
In front of her, a magnificent city collapses into a dazzling display of metallic dust. Towering steel structures melt like clay.
In front of her, the shadow of a terrible colossus floats in the clouds above, the writhing darkness blotting out the sun and enveloping all.
In front of her, anguished screams and desperate cries waft up from the city.
Behind her, the Originium crystal shines with a peculiar glow.
