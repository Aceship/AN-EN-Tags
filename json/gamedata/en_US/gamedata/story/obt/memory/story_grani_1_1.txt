[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_242",focus="l")]
[name="Mysterious Informant"]You were right on the money. This last year, they've been ramping up their purchases of refined Originium, processing equipment, and raw materials. It's clear that they're upping production capacity.

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_220_grani_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Grani"]Bolton Chemicals is the pillar of Rydell Cityâ€™s industries. If they wanted to ramp up production, they could just go through the city...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_242",focus="l")]
[name="Mysterious Informant"]But that takes money, which cuts into their bottom line. The most cost-effective way of increasing production capacity is... simply to have more in the first place.
