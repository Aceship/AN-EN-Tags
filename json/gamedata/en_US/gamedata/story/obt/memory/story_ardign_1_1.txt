[name="Merry"]Hello! Is this the liaison office of... uh... 'Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals?'
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]Uh... Yes! May I help you?
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=2)]
[name="Merry"]Um... My name is Merry. I'm from northern Leithanien... I-I guess I'm kind of a noble? I've got a pretty big family, and our neighbors love us.
[name="Merry"]I didn't bring my passbook with me, but I have this much in the bank... I-I can even work. I definitely won't owe any money for the medical fees!
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]Hmm...? Um... Excuse me...?
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=2)]
[name="Merry"]*Cough*... *Whimpers*, I'm sorry! I'm sorry I lied! I'm not a noble, and I don't have anywhere close to this much in the bank, but I will really work to pay for the treatment!
[name="Merry"]I have two friends with Oripathy. Please don't turn them down just because they are foreigners. They are heavily injured, and their lives are in danger. I really need someone to help them...!
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]Heavily injured Infected? Where are they?
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=2)]
[name="Merry"]At a settlement in the mountains. I left them there for the time being.
[name="Merry"]Please! Please come with me. It may be a little dangerous to travel there, but I promise! I promise I will keep the doctors safe even if I have to protect them with my life!
[name="Merry"]I'll do something about the medical fees too! Please just help them first...
[name="Merry"]Please, I beg you... Help my friends...
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]...
[name="Medic Operator"]You don't have to say that. Don't... swear on your life.
[name="Medic Operator"]It's Rhodes Island's mission to help the Infected, Miss Merry.
[name="Medic Operator"]We will go with you. Could you tell us how the Infected are doing?
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=2)]
[name="Merry"]Y-You will...?
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]Yes, we'll leave right away. Are they still in the early stages of their infection? If they are, then we mustn't wait. That's the best time to treat Oripathy.
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=2)]
[name="Merry"]I have their coordinates. I'll send them to you right away!
[name="Merry"]Oh, but... There's a snowstorm out in the countryside right now... We need to be prepared...
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]Relax. Rhodes Island has transport suitable for all kinds of weather, and also have experienced operators who can guarantee our safety during the trip. We'll make it there even in the harshest weather and most dangerous places.
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=2)]
[name="Merry"]Really?! That's so nice... I-Is this real?
[name="Merry"]I mean... I'm not too cold, am I? I-I can't feel my legs... Am I dreaming...?
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]*Sigh*... Looks like you need treatment yourself. Miss Merry, can you reach the patients right now?
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_209_ardign",focus=2)]
[name="Merry"]It's not a dream... It's not a dream!
[name="Merry"]I'll give them a call right now!

[name="Medic Operator"]Miss Merry, are you okay?

[name="Medic Operator"]We'll head to the coordinates' right now, but it'll take us seven to eight hours, even if the weather gets better.

[name="Merry"]Uhh... No way... It only took me five hours to get here...

[name="Medic Operator"]That was way too reckless! You... *Sigh*...

[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]I'll drive. The patients are waiting, and we need to head there ASAP. Is she sitting on the passenger side?
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]No, I need to take her in the med vehicle and treat her there.
[name="Medic Operator"]She's got frostbite, multiple scrapes, and sprained joints. From the looks of it... she might even have a few broken bones. It's a miracle she held on for so long.
[name="Medic Operator"]Five hours... That's way too reckless. How could she have made her way down such a treacherous path during a snowstorm...?
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]She's tough. If she managed to come all the way here that fast, she might just be the kind of operator we need.
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]And I heard her mumbling. She said she wanted to save her friends, right? That's some temperament she's got.
[character(name="char_016_medic",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]It's rash! She's just lucky, and she may not be as lucky next time! Seriously, if she was one of ours, the instructors would definitely be tearing her a new one.
[name="Medic Operator"]But fine... It's too early to talk about all this. Our top priority right now is to rescue her friends. As for Miss Merry herself...
[name="Medic Operator"]We'll have them walk us through everything she and her friends have been through after they all make it out safe.
