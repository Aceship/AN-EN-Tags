[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  Though you may not formally be on the Medical Department's roster of doctors, I still have a responsibility to remind you.
[name="Folinic"]  According to the “Regulations for Management and Treatment of Rhodes Island Wounded Personnel,” all wounded Operators must undergo registration at the Rhodes Island Medical Department.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#2",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  When people treat Operators' wounds in private like you have, we can put the little cuts and illnesses aside, but on the off-chance any complications arise in Operator Phantom's condition or from his wounds owing to your incomplete care, that creates a headache for the Medical Department.

[name="Phantom"]  There is no need to blame her.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4",name2="char_250_phantom_1",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  I'm just telling her the facts.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#5",name2="char_250_phantom_1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3",name2="char_250_phantom_1",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  Why didn't you report to the Medical Department following your injuries?

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#2",name2="char_250_phantom_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  This is irresponsible to the company, and irresponsible to yourself.

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1",name2="char_250_phantom_1",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  Right. I accept your apology.
[name="Folinic"]  Now, I need to issue you diagnosis and treatment, along with a full check on your state of health. No problem?

[name="Folinic"]  Just relax. There'll be no corridors. I'm not taking you to the Medical Department.
[name="Folinic"]  Blue Poison's told me you don't like places with a lot of people.
[name="Folinic"]  So I've brought all the equipment here.
[name="Folinic"]  I'll help you collect and sort out your treatment information, and then I'll treat your wounds for you with Dr. Whisperain.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  No problem, Dr. Whisperain?

[name="Folinic"]  Shoulder, perforation wound; injury to hand caused by sharp weapon; hypothermia...

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  Shoulder perforation wound.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=2)]
[name="Whisperain"]  I closed the wound just prior. There should be no jeopardy.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  Hm... If it was just an ordinary metal bolt, then we're good.
[name="Folinic"]  Did you debride?
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=2)]
[name="Whisperain"]  Already sorted.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  Judging from the healing of the wound, there should be no possibility of poisoning or infection.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  Right. Next item.
[name="Folinic"]  Laceration to the palm.
[name="Folinic"]  Hm. Seems to be healing well.
[name="Folinic"]  However, with two separate wounds, we have a substantially higher risk of infection, so in a moment, I'll give you a prophylactic injection. That should solve that worry.
[name="Folinic"]  Finally, frostbite on the left lower leg.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1",name2="char_250_phantom_1",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  Okay, alright. Stay like that, don't move. I brought the detection apparatus just for this.

[name="Folinic"]  We aren't optimistic about your Oripathy infection in the first place. We all need to do our best to avoid any situation that could worsen its progression.

[name="Phantom"]  That tickles. Don't you... hm? What is this?

[name="Whisperain"]  If I had to guess, she might want you to take a look at this leaflet.

[name="Phantom"]  Multimedia escape experience...
[Character(name="char_250_phantom_1",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=2)]
[name="Whisperain"]  I've heard it's a new manner of entertainment, one that emphasizes stimulating the senses and immersive experiences.
[name="Whisperain"]  It seems as though... most escape experiences are themed to rely principally on elements of terror and suspense.
[name="Whisperain"]  I'd seen one, some time before. Its theme was an underground labyrinth in Minos.
[name="Whisperain"]  Truthfully, I wanted very much to give it a try.
[name="Whisperain"]  But that day, the A1 Detachment's Operators told me after experiencing it themselves—
[name="Whisperain"]  “It scared me to death!”
[name="Whisperain"]  Yet, while they told me that, they seemed to be so happy.

[name="Phantom"]  (Hm... Enjoying being frightened?)
[Character(name="char_250_phantom_1",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=2)]
[name="Whisperain"]  I didn't dare go back then, and now that I think of it, maybe I regret that a little...
[name="Whisperain"]  Perhaps, this time, I can. Er, should I ask Weedy to come with me?

[name="Phantom"]  Ms. Christine, were you hoping for me to see this?

[name="Phantom"]  I believe I understand what you mean.

[name="Whisperain"]  You're leaving, now? So, have you decided on where to go for your vacation?
[Character(name="char_250_phantom_1",name2="char_436_whispr",focus=1)]
[name="Phantom"]  Just some concept of it.
[name="Phantom"]  If the right amount of fear can serve to bring others merriment.
