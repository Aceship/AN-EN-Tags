[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_997_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Costa"]They were a complex community, comprising many different species of migratory fowlbeasts, 'wayfowls' that came from all over the land, and its members took many different forms and habits.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_997_1#9$1",focus="m")]
