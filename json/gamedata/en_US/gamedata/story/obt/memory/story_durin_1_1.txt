[name="Durin"]Huh?
[name="Durin"](This red-haired tall one isn't very bright.)
[name="Durin"](Not that it matters though... *Yawn*... So sleepy...)

[name="Durin"]If I was really as amazing as you make me sound... *yawn*... My folks wouldn't have spent all that time nagging me.
[name="Durin"]But I'm frail, always sleepy... Sigh, it's not like I wanted to be like this...

[name="Durin"]Don't worry!
[name="Durin"]I go to Medical for regular check-ups, and I have no trouble with my normal work. Us Durins are tough—
[name="Durin"]Besides, I can always just blame my condition, and nobody can get mad at me for slacking off during work hours. Isn't that great?

Lack of energy, fatigue and listlessness, illness-prone, and a need for sleep to recover from any amount of exertion — Durin has long gotten used to having such a delicate body.
Congenital deficiency is different from disease and cannot be cured with medicine.
She used to be disgruntled and even angry about it, but when she came to the surface and saw its many stories, Durin came to terms with her physical weakness.
Like...
What does it matter if my body's a bit weaker?
Nothing beats getting sleep free and quiet under the sun during those easy hours of the workday.
