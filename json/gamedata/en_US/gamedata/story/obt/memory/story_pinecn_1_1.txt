But surprise! Your dad's found new work!
Remember Uncle Peter? He's an old work buddy of mine, and now he's a foreman. Does right by his friends too, I tell you! Called me in to the site. Good thing I kept covering his shifts all those years ago!
We're working on a small-scale nomadic city right now. I hear it's going to be used to temporarily settle people forced to migrate. It's no real big place, but functional enough, and welfare facilities are all well accounted for.
Peter says they're anticipating this city to work like a burdenbeast, doing runs through the wilds between big places like Trimounts, taking in anyone without a homeland anymore.
And it's all up to us to see to it that this burdenbeast gallops smooth!
Never thought Peter was foreman material, to be honest. The way he talks has grown just as much too. But he sure tells it like it is. There's still a hell of a lot of meaning in us building these hulking new cities.
That's our lot as frontier workers. The men don't matter so much, but the things we do matter like nothing else.

[name="Aciddrop"]It was this trick skateboarding competition a couple blocks got together to hold. Nothing big-time, but crazy professional. Champion's prize was a high-grade, custom-made board... yeah, see what I'm riding right now? This is one of them bad boys.
[stopmusic(fadetime=1)]

[name="Aciddrop"]Neighborhood was old bones, government turned it over to a megacorp to turn into a commercial sector. Said they were gonna build this business complex over the park we hung out at.
[name="Aciddrop"]Whoops, I meant 'commercial sector.' All they did was the same shady business once they landed...
[name="Aciddrop"]But in a city as big as Trimounts, skating, graffiti, it's stuff they only let you do in a designated area... a tiny little corner.
[character(name="avg_440_pinecn_1#4$1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]

[name="Aciddrop"]Neat's not a word to them, y'know? Freedom, risk... the bigshots don't like that stuff.
[name="Aciddrop"]They need order, doesn't matter if it's good or bad. 'Street culture's' just a dirty word to those guys.
