[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Caster Operator"] Yep. Given our branch offices operate under all sorts of conditions all across the world, any weird and wild commission could come to our doors.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Guard Operator"] But it IS usually just responding to some Infected or Originium.
[name="Guard Operator"] According to the info the office gave, the village militia'll help us with the operation. Says their chief's a pretty impressive one.
[character(name="avg_npc_061#7")]
[name="Blemishine"] We already spent a chunk of time just getting here. I hope nothing happened in the meanwhile...

[name="Blemishine"] You're the head of the village militia. Was Lanton the name?
[character(name="avg_npc_001")]
[name="Young Hunter"] No, I'm his brother Landi. The thing with him, well...
[name="Young Hunter"] Not long ago, while he was leading a team on patrol, they got attacked. The others were alright, but he went missing. We've searched for ages without turning up any trace of him, so now it's up to me to lead the militia until we get him back.

[name="Young Hunter"] I'm just hoping you can help out with catching those bandits. It'll take a weight off the village's shoulders.
[character(name="avg_npc_061#4")]
[name="Blemishine"] Our intel says a group of bandits stole a merchant caravan's Originium weapons, and then fled this way.
[name="Blemishine"] That tells us these bandits are no pushovers.
[character(name="avg_npc_061#5")]
[name="Blemishine"] Right now, it's highly likely they're eyeing the village, so all of you stay here to protect against potential raids.

[name="Young Hunter"] It doesn't matter if I was called a slouch. It doesn't matter if I'm not trusted... I don't want these things to bring me regret.
[name="Young Hunter"] So... I guess what I mean is it's the least I can do to fight off my brother.

[character(name="avg_npc_061#2")]
[name="Blemishine"] I always had some lingering fears.
[name="Blemishine"] I always thought me and my sister getting along was as natural as anything, and it would carry on just like that.
[name="Blemishine"] But now I know. I've just been lucky enough...
[name="Blemishine"] If at the time, I actually did fluke my way into winning the whole thing, and when Margaret came back, I'd turned into an outstanding competition knight—
[name="Blemishine"] Would I have become her enemy, maybe?
[name="Blemishine"] I have no idea.

[name="Blemishine"] Standing where I am, I've already realized, what I was thinking would probably never happen...
[name="Blemishine"] Because I'd never, ever end up in that position.
[name="Blemishine"] The old me would say it's because she suits it better than I do.
[character(name="avg_npc_061#2")]
[name="Blemishine"] But now, I'd like to say it's because—I know that being where I am suits me better.
[name="Blemishine"] I don't need the spotlight shone on me. If she can carry the equipment I've cast for her to stand in that light, that's enough for me.
[name="Blemishine"] If she wants a sword, then I'll forge her the sharpest sword. If she wants a shield, I'll forge her the sturdiest shield.
[name="Blemishine"] If she wants a way, then, well, I'll forge her the best tools to open it.
[name="Blemishine"] That's all there is to it.
