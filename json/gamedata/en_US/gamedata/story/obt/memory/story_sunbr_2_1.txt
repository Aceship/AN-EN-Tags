Amidst the chaos, the children of the Ursus Student Self-Governing Group form an intimate gathering.
Istina takes Gummy's left hand, while Zima takes her right hand. The little bears hold hands, their foreheads touching. Nobody backs away even when their cheeks get itchy brushing against their friends' hair.
Gummy presses her head against her friends', their foreheads gently touching just as they always do when they play together.
And her friends press back against her intimately.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2")]
[name="Istina"]Gummy, do you remember what I said before?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2")]
