[character(name="avg_129_bluep_1",name2="char_411_tomimi_1#3",focus=2)]

[name="Tomimi"]And what fun stuff might happen in the future?
[name="Tomimi"]I'm really looking forward to it.
[name="Tomimi"]I guess when Gavial chose to stay at Rhodes Island, and not in Acahualla, this was why.
[character(name="char_411_tomimi_1")]
[name="Tomimi"]......
[name="Tomimi"]I wonder what Gavial's up to now?

[name="Field Operator"]Thinking what I'm thinking? We can take a vacation.
