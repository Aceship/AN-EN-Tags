[name="Melantha"]  Hello.
[Character(name="char_208_melan_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]  Did you just finish training? It's so late... Doesn't it seem like the Reserve Team's training sessions have been running later and later?
[name="Logistics Operator"]  I'm glad that everyone is motivated, but your health should always come first.
[Character(name="char_208_melan_1#2",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_208_melan_1#4",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]

[name="Logistics Operator"]  But that's easier said than done... The cafeteria might already be out of hot food, so if you want something fresh, you'll probably have to cook it yourself.

[name="Dobermann"]  Ahem.
[Character(name="char_208_melan_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  Enough joking around. Melantha, Fallon's already talked to you about the Reserve Op Team's formation this time around, right?
[name="Dobermann"]  After talking things over, we decided to make you the captain. If Reserve Op Team A4 has no issues with it, I'll bring you the paperwork that needs to be signed tomorrow.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]

[name="Franka"]  Makes sense that you'd prefer to train up your own teams than rely on outsiders. I get it.

[name="Melantha"]  Well, Steward thinks things through a lot better.
[name="Melantha"]  During the last mock battle, we made three mistakes. Steward was the one who made up for them behind the scenes and won us a good final result. Everyone trusts him.
[name="Melantha"]  Ansel always pays close attention to our health, and he can often judge how we're doing and prepare appropriate measures even if we don't tell him anything.
[name="Melantha"]  Adnachiel, um, though I still can't tell what he's thinking, whenever we need firepower, he's always able to identify the needs of each teammate and launch attacks from the most suitable position.
[name="Melantha"]  Merry... Um, Cardigan, is energetic but not reckless. She always pays close attention to protecting the other members of the team during battle. Our formations are often centered around her.

[name="Melantha"]  I... I might have areas where I'm not good enough, and there might be a lot of things I still have to learn...
[Dialog]
But putting them aside, I... What do I want to do?
What is it that I want?
[Dialog]
[Character(name="char_209_ardign", name2="char_208_melan_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Melantha"]  I want to be able to protect people. Not just be sheltered by my parents, struggling to communicate with my own family...
[name="Melantha"]  I'll give it my all! I'll do everything I can to become a worthy captain, and continue to grow alongside all of you.

[name="Melantha"]  Merry, are you... okay with that?
[Character(name="char_209_ardign", name2="char_208_melan_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Cardigan"]  Of course!
[name="Cardigan"]  Isn't that what we've always been doing all this time?
[Character(name="char_209_ardign", name2="char_208_melan_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Melantha"]  Yes... Thank you, Merry.
[Character(name="char_209_ardign", name2="char_208_melan_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Cardigan"]  Mmhmm!
[name="Cardigan"]  Ehehe, I'm so glad you're finally smiling!

[Character(name="char_211_adnach_1", name2="char_210_stward_1", focus=1)]
[name="Adnachiel"]  They found the frozen food in the freezer and are heating it up now. What should I do with these sweets, Steward? Should I still hand them over?
[Character(name="char_211_adnach_1", name2="char_212_ansel_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ansel"]  Why are we still hiding over here anyway?
[Character(name="char_212_ansel_1", name2="char_210_stward_1", focus=2)]
[name="Steward"]  I don't think we're needed here. Hold up a sec, Adnachiel, Ansel. Don't head over there yet, let them be alone a bit longer.
[Character(name="char_212_ansel_1", name2="char_210_stward_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Steward"]  I don't think I've ever seen Miss Melantha smile so happily before.
[Character(name="char_211_adnach_1#3", name2="char_210_stward_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Adnachiel"]  But...
[Character(name="char_211_adnach_1#3", name2="char_212_ansel_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ansel"]  Steward's right. It'd be way too awkward if we just dropped in now.
[Character(name="char_211_adnach_1#3", name2="char_212_ansel_1", focus=1)]
[name="Adnachiel"]  But, knowing the way Cardigan does things...

[Character(name="char_209_ardign", name2="char_208_melan_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Melantha"]  Is this... the heating button? The connection seems a little loose, so maybe we should turn it this way...
[Character(name="char_209_ardign", name2="char_208_melan_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Cardigan"]  Don't worry, I got this. I know just the thing, since basically all machines work like this!

[name="Dobermann"]  ...Just a little.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]  Because your team ran up another bill for destroying a kitchen appliance? Or because of your new shy team captain?
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  All of the above. Melantha still lacks confidence in herself.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]  Oh? Well, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing either.
[name="Franka"]  Compared to all those morons who have nothing but confidence without any of the skills to back it up, it's reassuring to be around some more cautious and reserved people, wouldn't you agree?
[name="Franka"]  Plus, you heard what she said.
[name="Franka"]  She's been paying close attention to every single member of her team. Is that not what a captain should do?
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex#2",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  It'd be great... if she recognized that.
