This wasn't my first encounter with this deadpan, stone-cold new hire.
Last year, the Notarial Hall recruited three new trainee executors, but unfortunately, two of them were ultimately unable to join our ranks.
One failed the traineeship period's assessment exam, while the other suddenly discovered that inheriting the family dessert shop would be a more fitting career path and handed in his resignation the day before he was to start as a regular.
The last one remaining was this young man by the name of Federico.
