It is almost noon, and the sun shines brightly outside.
Inside, however, all the doors and windows are tightly shut, with only a few rays of sunlight leaking through the cracks between the boards that have been nailed to the windows, preventing the room from being entirely engulfed in darkness.
The visitor hears the faint sound of scratching coming from the darkest corner.
He straightens his robe and approaches a massive canvas standing upright. A woman is using her brush to fill it with color.
