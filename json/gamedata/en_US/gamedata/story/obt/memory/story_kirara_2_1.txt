[name="Irritable Infected"]Even if it wouldn't, we've got to! You saying you want those bloodthirsty cutthroats to make off with our medicine, after we barely managed to buy it?
[name="Irritable Infected"]All our efforts just to buy this one cheap measly lot of suppressants! And I want you to imagine, if it wasn't for them, then you, me, the village at large, how long we'll still be alive for all these damn stones in us!

[Character(name="avg_npc_005",name2="avg_npc_001",focus=1)]

[name="Tense Infected"]Better we give them whatever they want. Better than dooming us all. We—We can always figure out something else!

[name="Irritable Infected"]I didn't hear this lousy tune from you when those girls helped us fend off the beasts AFTER dropping off the medicine, or when that doctor girl gave you an examination!
[name="Irritable Infected"]You think the measly amount we forked over was worth them delivering it all the way out here, and bringing a doctor to do checkups free of charge?
[name="Irritable Infected"]If that's the lengths Rhodes Island will go to, then whether or not the medicine works, I'm still believing in them!
[Character(name="avg_npc_005",name2="avg_npc_001",focus=1)]

The voice of gratitude is near-inaudible.
Silent since the villager entered the room, the girl seems in a rush to dodge all lines of sight, dropping her gaze to the maps she now holds.
Being hand-drawn by the Infected of the wild settlement, they are rough and crude, no more than a few abstract lines drawn as hints in parts; they could hardly amount to real topographies.
