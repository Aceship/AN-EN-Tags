[name="Bald Marcin"]  Gravel, what are you talking about?
[Character(name="char_237_gravel",name2="avg_npc_107",focus=1)]
[name="Gravel"]  And you, Marcin, you too. It could never miss you that I'd left Kazimierz, joined Rhodes Island... That's right, I came back from 'Rhodes Island.'

[Character(name="char_237_gravel", focus=-1)]
[name="Gekoski"]  Hmph. Have you already told them your name?
[Character(name="char_237_gravel")]
[name="Gravel"]  Not yet. I need to confirm for myself once more, whether or not they're deceiving me, whether they want to use me for evil.
[Character(name="char_237_gravel", focus=-1)]
[name="Gekoski"]  Then go. To that Rhodes Island to see, and continue your hometown search as you do.

[Character(name="char_237_gravel", focus=-1)]
[name="Gekoski"]  Stop.
[name="Gekoski"]  It is just as we said those years ago, Gravel. Go. You were to leave sooner or later. As you are decisive in this moment, so there is little to long for.
[name="Gekoski"]  Come back to Kazimierz, should you want to come back. And should you not... then do not be burdened, and go!

[name="Gravel"]  I went unsaved by a Knight, was trafficked into Kazimierz, sold into Kawalerielki... and I didn't even know how to go about getting back home.
[Character(name="avg_npc_004",name2="char_237_gravel",focus=1)]

[name="Gravel"]  I am a vassal to the master of the house. I'll forever revere him, be grateful for him.
[name="Gravel"]  But, the last thing he said to me... is that I shouldn't forever long for this place.
[name="Gravel"]  I left Kazimierz. Because I had a reason to. And it was time to find my own true home and parents.
[name="Gravel"]  Yes... this is all just a dream.
[name="Gravel"]  And I know this, because there wouldn't ever be another child kidnapped into Kawalerielki.

[name="Gravel"]  Those ruthless scum dressing up in the skins of 'bounty hunters' were the last force in the trafficking business. As far back as I'd followed every village patrol and punished every hunter, they were already—

[name="Gravel"]  Even today, I still can't bring to mind where it is I came from. I only remember it was a place completely different from Kazimierz.
[name="Gravel"]  Poor, a backwater... fragile. The parents of mine who couldn't even protect their own child.
[name="Gravel"]  But no matter what, all these years and years, I've wanted always to find my home, to return and see my parents. I don't know if they're well, or if they'd still remember me.
[name="Gravel"]  How lucky of me, to be picked up by that old knight, to have a fate unlike the other 'chattel', to seize knighthood by my own efforts.
[name="Gravel"]  But, I've never forgotten... why it is I became a Knight.
