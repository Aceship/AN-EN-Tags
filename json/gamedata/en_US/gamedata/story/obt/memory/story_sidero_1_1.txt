[name="Sideroca"]  Hello? Can you hear me?
[name="Sideroca"]  Long time no see, Madame President!
[name="Sideroca"]  I heard you'll be visiting, so I took the liberty of reaching out. I hope you don't mind.
[name="Sideroca"]  Y-Yes.
[name="Sideroca"]  My parents' business is doing well, thanks to you.
[name="Sideroca"]  I'm sure you know. Those of us from Corinia tend to really think highly of that.
[name="Sideroca"]  Me?
[name="Sideroca"]  I'm prospering here, much thanks to you.
[name="Sideroca"]  Perhaps we could get a meal together soon?
[name="Sideroca"]  The day after tomorrow? Yes, of course!
[name="Sideroca"]  I'm always free! I'm just so happy to get to share a meal with you!
[name="Sideroca"]  Yes, okay.
[name="Sideroca"]  Something more modest? How about the cafeteria?
[name="Sideroca"]  Is the food at the cafeteria not to your liking?
[name="Sideroca"]  A private room? Isn't that a little too excessive?
[name="Sideroca"]  No, I'm sorry, that was thoughtless of me to say!
[name="Sideroca"]  Y-Yes, okay. I'll see you then.
[name="Sideroca"]  Thank you very much, Madame President.
[name="Sideroca"]  Bye.

[name="Sideroca"]  Yes...
[name="Sideroca"]  I couldn't find her after I took Suzuran to the clinic, so I thought I'd come to you...
[name="Sideroca"]  I'm sorry. This is all my fault, Instructor Dur-nar! I couldn't keep my eye on her.

[Character(name="char_333_sidero_1", name2="char_260_durnar_1", focus=1)]
[name="Sideroca"]  I've been thinking I'm not doing very well in this particular area. I'm always losing track of my targets.

[Character(name="char_333_sidero_1", name2="char_260_durnar_1", focus=2)]
[name="Dur-nar"]  Ugh...
[name="Dur-nar"]  Those are just exceptions. Right, exceptions.
[name="Dur-nar"]  Our day-to-day environment is very different from the battlefield. I am sure there is nothing wrong with your ability to track enemies on the field.
[Character(name="char_333_sidero_1", name2="char_260_durnar_1", focus=1)]
[name="Sideroca"]  Really?
[Character(name="char_333_sidero_1", name2="char_260_durnar_1", focus=2)]
[name="Dur-nar"]  Yes, I'm sure of it.
[Character(name="char_333_sidero_1", name2="char_260_durnar_1", focus=1)]
[name="Sideroca"]  I'm very happy to hear that.
[Character(name="char_333_sidero_1", name2="char_260_durnar_1", focus=2)]
[name="Dur-nar"]  Yeah.
[Character(name="char_333_sidero_1", name2="char_260_durnar_1", focus=1)]
[name="Sideroca"]  In that case, would it be okay if I apply for courses that teach me how to track people down in our day-to-day living environments? I think this is a very important thing to learn.
[Character(name="char_333_sidero_1", name2="char_260_durnar_1", focus=2)]
[name="Dur-nar"]  Uh—Hm?
[name="Dur-nar"]  Oh, um... Well, about that.
[name="Dur-nar"]  It's getting late, so why don't you head home and get some rest? I'll talk to the other instructors about that over the next couple of days. I should have some good news for you later.
[Character(name="char_333_sidero_1", name2="char_260_durnar_1", focus=1)]

[name="Dur-nar"]  You really should watch it yourself.
[name="Dur-nar"]  According to the dorm staff, Bubble has been holing up in her room the whole time, leaving only to shower. She didn't even come out for dinner; her roommate had to bring her her meal.
