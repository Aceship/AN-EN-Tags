[name="???"]  ......
[name="???"]  Perhaps my understanding is flawed, but does the handling method Rhodes Island has chosen fall under the... cooperation you mentioned?

[Delay(time=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Our liaison was precisely to discuss that, but it seems you've arrived a few hours ahead of schedule.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1",blackstart=0.3,blackend=0.5)]
[name="???"]  I would imagine that even on dry land, arriving earlier than the designated time ought not undermine trust.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And even in Ægir, traipsing through the entryway of another's home without so much as a greeting ought not constitute etiquette.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1",blackstart=0.3,blackend=0.5)]
[name="???"]  You remain quite eloquent, but I have no intention of apologizing. Moreover...
Before the Ægir's voice reaches, she has already reappeared over ten meters away, standing before the door at corridor's end as if she had been there all along.
Only her voice, left to linger in the hallway, attests to her movement.
She presses her lance lightly against the solitary door, covered in pale blue stickers. Her expression communicates both disgust and indignation, yet her breathing is calm and unperturbed.

[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]  Forgive me for asking, but what purpose could compel you to allow a room of this kind, Dame Kal'tsit?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  As I described in my letter, those living quarters belong to another partner of Rhodes Island.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]  Do I mishear you? It is my solemn hope that you have not been drawing inspiration from that school of lunatics and their revolting technology.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Rest assured that we will not attempt to contend with a menace threatening to engulf this land by making use of a different one.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1")]
[name="Gladiia"]  That is a relief above any other.

An oblique notch is abruptly slashed into the tough alloy of the doorway, and in one audible movement the Ægir's foot elegantly pries it apart into two clean halves.
She disappears through it, sweeps across the room as if searching, and reappears with nothing to show, all in the blink of an eye.

[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1")]
[name="Gladiia"]  How bizarre. I've somehow managed to mistake the scent of those dregs.
[name="Gladiia"]  Or perhaps I should have realized that when you never lifted a finger to stop me, it was not out of acquiescence.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Setting aside your combat skills, I fear the Abyssal Hunters must also learn to control their emotions when faced with their old enemy.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Although their present evolution is but the fruit of selective pressures, unguided by intellect, there may always come a day when they reach that milestone.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#4")]
[name="Gladiia"]  Keh. Assume they do. Perhaps, one day, I will indeed try and resist the urge to mangle those filthy beings just long enough to understand their intent.
[name="Gladiia"]  Tell me, then. Does Rhodes Island house these things simply to teach me that valuable lesson?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I had no intention of playing games with you. My confidence in the Abyssal Hunters' remarkable drive to action simply meant I couldn't let this conversation end before it began.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]  And for whose sake does your firm believe my Hunters so carefully and cautiously interact with you all? Keeping far from the landship, daring not to be wounded or shed blood?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The information we can obtain from the subject's physiology is worth far more than the brutal death of a single Sea Terror. As a designer of warfare yourself, you should understand this.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I've transferred the cooperating subject known as 'Mizuki' elsewhere for the time being. I hope we can now have an even-tempered discussion and reach an equally rational conclusion.

[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#3", name2="avg_npc_193", focus=2)]
[name="Bolívarian Serviceman A"]  Reporting in, no. Our informants have been shadowing her the whole time. She's never left the room, and hasn't sent out any instructions.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1", name2="avg_npc_193", focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]  Excellent. It's still a few hours until sunrise. That's plenty of time for a cover-up.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#2")]
[name="Ernesto"]  We can't let her catch wind of our explosives. The only thing she won't ignore is anything that risks her city plates getting destroyed and scaring the bastards living it up here.
[name="Ernesto"]  Have we found out who was responsible for the warehouse yet?
[character(name="avg_npc_193", name2="avg_486_espumo_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bolívarian Serviceman B"]  Reporting in, it was two mercenaries from True Bolívarians.
[name="Bolívarian Serviceman B"]  But we can't link to their comm terminals, and they're not in their hideout. Our guys are on their trail right now.
[character(name="avg_npc_193", name2="avg_486_espumo_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Ernesto"]  Any moves from the Singas side? With the Championship coming up, they should be asking Ms. Candela what the hell's going on, after their guys got hurt in an explosion.
[character(name="avg_npc_193", name2="avg_486_espumo_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bolívarian Serviceman B"]  Apparently they're looking for someone. Based on what little we've overheard, they're calling whoever it is 'those kids'.
[character(name="avg_npc_193", name2="avg_486_espumo_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Ernesto"]  Wasn't there a Leithanian youth choir staying at a pub near the warehouse recently?
[character(name="avg_npc_193", name2="avg_486_espumo_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Ernesto"]  Were any of the pub's employees caught in the explosion?
[character(name="avg_npc_193", name2="avg_486_espumo_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bolívarian Serviceman B"]  Reporting in. We've checked everyone's IDs. Practically all of them were pub security. And simultaneously Singas government soldiers, of course.
[character(name="avg_npc_193", name2="avg_486_espumo_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Ernesto"]  Haha, looks like those two mercenaries got both us and the Singas guys good.
[character(name="avg_npc_193", name2="avg_486_espumo_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Ernesto"]  If the Singas people aren't complaining to Ms. Candela, then maybe they were planning to buy the explosives from them...
[name="Ernesto"]  And the True Bolívarians side used the deal as a trap to lure in and blow up the Singases in the pub. Taking the opportunity to kidnap the VIPs too—the 'kids'.
[character(name="avg_npc_193", name2="avg_486_espumo_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bolívarian Serviceman B"]  What? That takes some balls... What's the plan, then?
[character(name="avg_npc_193", name2="avg_486_espumo_1#1", focus=2)]
[name="Ernesto"]  Prioritize staging it to look like a fire, just your everyday accident. Ms. Candela needs to believe that.
[name="Ernesto"]  Maybe if we can find the kids first, we'll have even more room to bargain with the Singases...
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1", name2="avg_npc_193", focus=2)]
[name="Bolívarian Serviceman A"]  Reporting in! We just intercepted an anonymous message on its way to the police terminals.
[name="Bolívarian Serviceman A"]  It's got info on True Bolívarians kidnapping the Leithanian choir, as well as some coordinates.
[name="Bolívarian Serviceman A"]  Right now we're the only ones with the tip-off. What's our next move?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#7", name2="avg_npc_193", focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]  Wipe all traces of it immediately! We can't let Ms. Candela's people find out.
[name="Ernesto"]  The coordinates are probably fake. Don't jump the gun. Just seal all routes out of the city, and focus on making it look like a fire.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#7", name2="avg_npc_193", focus=2)]
[name="Bolívarian Serviceman A"]  On it!

[name="Cowardly Mercenary"]  But, uh, our brothers more or less dealt with them, so it worked out...

[name="Impatient Mercenary"]  Think. None of our brothers actually want to get into this random shit with those True Bolívarians, do they? Maybe we're all planning to make a run for it?
[character(name="avg_npc_008", name2="avg_npc_007", focus=2)]
[name="Cowardly Mercenary"]  Yeah... Yeah, but I always thought Pancho's ideas made some sense...

[name="Impatient Mercenary"]  Hey. Who gives a shit what makes sense? It can be the biggest no-brainer and it's still useless if he can't take the city with it.
[name="Impatient Mercenary"]  And well, even if he does, all you can do with this city is skim dirty money off the top. It doesn't even have a single proper workyard.
[name="Impatient Mercenary"]  He wants to fund the Bolívarian nation? Without support from the Columbians and Leithanians, I doubt he can fund even a single decent weapon.
