[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]I saw you staring at the model on the desk. You almost had me thinking maybe there was something wrong with it.
[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]I heard from the senior operators that the engineering team made this model as a memento, after Fort Barron's retrofit was completed and delivered.
[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]So, there's nothing wrong with it, right?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#11$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_524_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]I'm ready. Let me take a look at your report... Ahem...
[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]Laura, what did you do after you received the order to catch the bank robbers?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#10$1",focus="l")]
[name="Laura"]At the time, I was leading the engineering team to double-check the structural integrity of the plate connection, and after we got the news...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Laura"]I chose to continue the work we were already doing.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_524_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]Could you go into the reasoning behind your decision?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#10$1",focus="l")]
[name="Laura"]The orders I received were that, aside from those participating directly in the plate's connection work, all other teams were to start pursuing the bank robbers.
[name="Laura"]And I made the determination that the connection work still needed the manpower of our engineering team.
[name="Laura"]So I chose to follow orders and not divert anyone from our work.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_524_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]But according to the report, one of the bank robbers was your partner at Davistown. Were you aware of that?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Laura"]I... I knew about that, yeah.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_524_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#9$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_524_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#10$1",focus="l")]

[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]I need to tell you this, Laura. Ever since we got back from Davistown, you've looked kind of uneasy.

[name="Laura"]I was in Davistown from the start. I saw most of what happened with my own eyes. I experienced most of it personally.
[name="Laura"]It's a Blacksteel employee's responsibility to execute their orders during a mission, and to compile a report on it afterwards. Besides...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#9$1",focus="m")]

[name="Blacksteel Mercenary"]While completing a government-sanctioned mission, a Blacksteel employee participated in criminal activities and greatly damaged our company's image and reputation.
[name="Blacksteel Mercenary"]Everyone here already knows all that. It isn't something worth bringing up over and over again. Especially not... two weeks after the fact.

[name="Laura"]Boss.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1045_1#1$1")]
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]Do you need me for something?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#2$1")]
[name="Laura"]I'm sure you know that my last mission was in Davistown, right...?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1045_1#1$1")]
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]I'm aware. What's up?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#2$1")]
[name="Laura"]About that, I wrote up a mission report as per protocol.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1045_1#1$1")]
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]Since when did we have a protocol like that?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#10$1")]
[name="Laura"]Well, we do...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1045_1#1$1")]
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]Mission report... Oh, now I remember. Yeah, I guess you're right.
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]That was a big mission, with plenty of twists and turns. Good work getting a report out of all that.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#10$1")]
[name="Laura"]No, it’s nothing.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1045_1#1$1")]
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]So I trust this will fill in a lot of blanks about the incident.

The man on the other side of the desk quickly reads through her report as she watches.
There's a sigh.
That's not what she expected.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1045_1#1$1")]
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]This isn't what you should be writing reports on, Laura.
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]We're in charge of technology. There shouldn't be anything in here unrelated to our engineering work.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#2$1")]
[name="Laura"]I understand that, but I saw so much more than that while carrying out my mission.
[name="Laura"]I can't pretend I didn't.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1045_1#1$1")]
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]...…
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]*sigh*
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]Whatever. No one's going to read this anyway, so it'll do.

He flips to the last page of the report and briskly signs his name.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1045_1#1$1")]
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]You still have a long career ahead of you.
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]You really need to learn to sort out what you've seen and what you haven't.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#2$1")]
[name="Laura"]Sorry, Chief, I'm just an engineer. I'm not too good at that sort of thing.
[name="Laura"]Which is why I have a request.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1045_1#1$1")]
[name="Engineering Supervisor"]Go on.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#2$1")]
[name="Laura"]I want to apply for the next round of exchange projects and be dispatched to Rhodes Island.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]Of course it. It's right here in the <i>Big Book of Interview Questions</i> Franka gave me. 'Every now and then, interviewees should be asked questions about the accessories they're wearing.'
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#11$1")]
[name="Laura"]Alright then... My mother made me this, and I've been carrying it around ever since. Is that good enough?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]Shorter than the expected answer length, but it shouldn't be a problem.
[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]Besides, you've already been through so many terrifying tests before this.
[name="Blacksteel Clerk"]Didn't Franka tell you? As long as you pass the tests, the interview's just a formality and an excuse to chat. The way I see it, there's nothing to prep for.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4105_almond_1#2$1")]
[name="Laura"]Oh, no no no. If I'm doing something, I've gotta do it <i>right</i>! I'm not taking any chances. Quick, next question!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
