Yes, I got it down after one try. Your brother did too.
But it's alright. You're the youngest, so of course you won't be as good as us right away.
Let's take it one step at a time. If you don't succeed at first, just try again. If you can't get it today, pick it up tomorrow.

[name="Testing Supervisor"]		Jessica, are you really leaving?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]	    Huh? Oh, um, yes. Sorry...
[Character]
[name="Testing Supervisor"]		*sigh*... It's not easy for new recruits to pass our training and examinations. Now that you've officially joined Blacksteel, shouldn't you be full of excitement and fighting spirit? At least for a while?
[name="Testing Supervisor"]		Plus, you were trained by Instructor Eyland.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]	    I only barely based the exam, and Instructor Eyland... Umm...
[Character]
[name="Testing Supervisor"]		You're still new. You can't expect everything to go smoothly the first time.
[name="Testing Supervisor"]		Why are you so adamant on leaving Blacksteel anyway? Did getting hurt on that one mission spook you?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]	    No, it was just a scratch, but...
[name="Jessica"] 	Sorry.
[Character]
[name="Testing Supervisor"]		Well, it's fine. We all have our own reasons, so if there's something you're struggling with, I won't pry.
[name="Testing Supervisor"]		What did you think about the explosive-resistant shield you just tested?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"] 	Huh? Umm... I think it was made from a newly-developed Raythean material, and felt like it would be effective against most kinds of projectiles.
[name="Jessica"]	    But overall, it felt a bit unwieldy... Ah, s-sorry, I should've been incorporating more strength training into my daily exercise.
[Character]
[name="Testing Supervisor"]		I won't deny, the design is a bit clunky for a Feline. Your judgment is as sharp as ever.
[name="Testing Supervisor"]		You've been great, Jessica. We were able to get a ton of data from you carrying it through the whole trial.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]	    D-Don't mention it, I'm just doing my job... My last job here.

[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Thank you very much. Our technical cooperation with Blacksteel has always been the most important part of Raythean's business, and we are especially grateful for your assistance, Mr. 'Clip.'
[name="Blacksteel Senior Manager"]	Haha, that was years ago. Plus, I'd reckon there are few suppliers other than Raythean that could meet Blacksteel's demand.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	That's true. The development and improvement of etched ammo has always been one of our top R&D priorities.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	I hope we'll get to chat again next quarter, after the orders have been docked.
[name="Blacksteel Senior Manager"]	Of course.

[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	    Well... Blacksteel's training is rigorous, and I feel like I've been steadily improving. But I've still got a long way to go until I can become a qualified mercenary.

[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	It seems like you've also found this trip worthwhile. That's great to hear.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	I believe you and your father have not seen each other for two years, right? Mr. Brynley has been waiting for you to return home.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Are you through with the resignation procedures? And is your luggage prepared? I'll have someone over to load everything onto the transport.

[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]

[name="Jessica"]	    So, I want to know...
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=2)]
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	I see. At first, Mr. Brynley acknowledged your ambitions and allowed you to join Blacksteel, to broaden your horizons and find yourself.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	But he's come to learn that Blacksteel has been smothering your abilities, and though he is filled with regrets, he still allowed you three months to decide whether you wanted to stay.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	    I understand... My performance here has not been enough to earn Father's acknowledgement.
[name="Jessica"]	    Sorry. I tried my best, but...
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=2)]
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	No, I should be apologizing, Madam Jessica. I might be repeating myself here, but I hope you'll hear me out. Your father wants you to go home for a variety of reasons.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	You're currently working in the Department of Equipment and Applied Technologies. Blacksteel can take full advantage of your background here, but for you, there's no denying that you're vastly overqualified.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	    You know I'm not very talented...
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=2)]
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	The top-of-the-line equipment you handle here at Blacksteel is nothing but the product of endless internal testing at Raythean.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Since you're interested in this work, why not return to Raythean, where you can truly flex your muscles and make a difference?
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	And this hardly bears repeating, but it is your family business, after all.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	By your father's side, you are guaranteed to have all the resources you could ever want at your disposal, as well as the room to fully express yourself.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	You wouldn't need to work your way up from a lowly equipment tester, nor would your contributions go ignored for long periods, as they are now.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Look at you. You hardly look like the scion of the Brynley family.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	S-Sorry... I'm just too useless...
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=2)]
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Come on now, Madam Jessica, enough with the self-deprecation.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	By the way, I heard you were injured on a recent field mission. Is that true?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	Um, it's because I didn't train enough and got too nervous in a combat situation... Sorry, I still need to polish my skills more.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=2)]
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	I see. You understand now, right? Being a mercenary is a dangerous, life-threatening affair.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	No matter how hard you train, there's always the risk of injury.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	I also have a young daughter, and I also understand the love Mr. Brynley has for you, so please don't take this the wrong way.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Mr. Brynley encouraged his children to go out on their own, as a good father should, and he would've appreciated it if you were able to start something of your own, like your sister did.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	But, you are his youngest daughter. Mr. Brynley still hopes that you can draw on the experiences of those who've come before you, suffer fewer hardships, take fewer detours, and return home as soon as possible.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Compared to your brother and sister, you're not as socially skilled as them, nor have you dedicated yourself to mechanical design.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Carving out a domain for yourself relying solely on your physical prowess and combat abilities is still out of your reach.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	You're certainly not wrong...
[name="Jessica"]	I'm sorry, Mr. Raymond... I keep letting you and my father down.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=2)]
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Nonsense. Besides, Raythean can always make you a custom set of equipment to enjoy on your return.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	If you had better protective gear, you would've been fine in a small skirmish like that.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	But even if I had access to the best gear... what would I be able to do with it?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=2)]
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	All that matters you put the equipment we've painstakingly made to good use. You don't have to think too hard about what you want to do with it.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Oh right, Fort Barron is still a fair distance away. Could you enjoy desserts made by a gold-medal chef here?
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	I remember when you came to my office a number of years ago, Mr. Brynley directed me to order an entire table of desserts.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	Um... Training here involves strict dieting...
[name="Jessica"]	Though, I still buy snacks every now and then... Ugh, if only I had more self-discipline.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=2)]
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Please don't be too tough on yourself, Madam Jessica. I think you've worked hard enough.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Earlier, I spoke to Mr. Eyland, your training instructor, and he didn't have much of an impression of you, except the fact that you train very hard.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Even a respected, elite mercenary like Eyland found nothing lacking in your performance. Though you didn't particularly stand out either, your hard work helped you narrowly pass the exam.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	What is there to blame yourself for?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1#5", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	Instructor Eyland...
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	I'm sorry... I get nervous just thinking about him...
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=2)]
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	Good grief, this is exactly what Mr. Brynley has been worried about. You've already endured so much hardship here.
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	But I'm glad to see that you've put up with all of it. You've now gained valuable experience, and honed your already excellent qualities. If you were to return home, I'm sure you'd...
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]	I... I'm sorry.
[name="Jessica"]	I haven't finalized my resignation process yet, and... um, before I leave, I'd like to... say goodbye to my friends. Can I have a bit more time?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=2)]
[name="Raythean Industries Representative"]	*sigh*... I'm afraid this will disrupt the schedule, and your father is waiting for you to return home... But of course, it's all up to you.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="avg_npc_222",focus=1)]

Her family had already selected a school and specialization for her advanced studies. She even had her job after graduation planned out for her, but she wanted to submit her resume to Blacksteel Worldwide.
She told her father that she still didn't know what she was capable of, so she wanted to further refine herself.

What if you're not a good fit for the job? Aren't you afraid you'll end up having to take detours?

[name="Jessica"]	Thank you. Thank you for acknowledging me.
[name="Jessica"]	I think...
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=3)]
She clenches her fist, just as she had done that day when she stood in front of her father's office.

[name="Jessica"]	...I would like to take this opportunity.
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1")]
[name="Liskarm"]	Good, very good.
[name="Liskarm"]	But just so we're clear, I'm warning you in advance that my BPRS is a very unique division... It's fringe work, and always extremely dangerous.
[name="Liskarm"]	We deal with Infected organisms and acute Originium contamination incidents, to give you an idea of the risks involved.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]	I, I understand...
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1")]
[name="Liskarm"]	When facing a normal operation, most injuries you might suffer can be fully healed. But when you're out with BPRS, more serious wounds might mean that you contract Oripathy.
[name="Liskarm"]	I've seen enough of your files to know that you sustained minor injuries on your last mission.
[name="Liskarm"]	Of course, BPRS is equipped with comprehensive protective measures, and Director Janet has been working hard to improve the division's emergency responses, to reduce the risk of infection.
[name="Liskarm"]	Also, if you become my deputy, I'll have higher expectations for your training. I will not deploy you on dangerous missions until you've fully met those expectations.
[name="Liskarm"]	So that's the situation. I came to you before starting an inter-department transfer application, just so you can decide what you want to do.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]	Thank you... But I've already made up my mind!
[name="Jessica"]	I'll continue to broaden my experiences, and get more rigorous training... Then, I'll find my own answers.
[name="Jessica"]	N-Not just answers to my own questions, but also those about life and how to live it... In the course of my missions, I've seen things that I'm still confused about, even now.
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1")]
[name="Liskarm"]	Is that so? I apologize, but I might not be able to give you the answers you're looking for.
[name="Liskarm"]	But I'm glad that my deputy thinks about these same issues.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]

My little girl still wants to keep being 'Jessica' of Blacksteel Worldwide...? That stubbornness is exactly what you'd expect from a child of the Brynley family.
I apologize for making you say so many harsh things to her, but I need to know that she's strong enough to find her own footing, not just drifting along the currents in the one place she's been thrown.
Of course, I'd prefer not to see her suffer. There is too much cruelty in this world, and she will have many questions to which there are no easy answers.
But if she wants to be a challenger, then so be it. Even if she's the last child in the family to find out what she should do in life... or she never finds it.
