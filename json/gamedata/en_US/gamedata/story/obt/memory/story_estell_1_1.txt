[name="Estelle"]I am, but I usually work more on the support and rescue side.
[name="Estelle"]Like carrying stuff, moving patients, or evacuating the wounded.
[name="Estelle"]Sometimes I'm also involved in direct combat, like when rescuing the wounded in the heat of battle.
[name="Estelle"]Or escorting our doctors.

The Archosauria girl sighs, lifts her head, and presses herself against the walls of the clinic, horns and all.
There is no smell of vitamin solution, but she feels surprisingly relaxed.
The dark night and scattered stars outside the windows are no different from what she'd seen out on the barrens for so many years.
Today, however, she is home. Here at Rhodes Island.
