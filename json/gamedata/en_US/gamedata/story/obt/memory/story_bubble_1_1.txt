A map with a yellow arrow is posted on the wall in a corner of the playroom. Bubble tries her hardest to stand on her tiptoes in an attempt to read its bottommost part.
A few days ago, she saw a bunch of busy operators passing around that map. Their faces were covered in ash and scars, and they all had a serious, solemn look. It was really badass.

Bubble wants to throw the thing in her hand away to hop into the embrace of her papa who wouldn't have come to visit until a whole lot of days or even months or maybe years later.
But she also wants to show her medal to her papa, and so her hand reaches back to grab it.
This causes her left leg to trip over her right. She almost falls onto the ground bum first, but she has very good reflexes thanks to her training at Rhodes Island. She instinctively adjusts her posture to have her shield fall onto the ground—
But instead she falls onto a big hand that's firm yet soft to the touch.

She points at the small medal that Papa likewise caught, but all of a sudden, she also feels kinda embarrassed about it.

But Papa keeps rubbing the two medals with a smile. The circular metallic pieces look so tiny in his big hands, but he seems to be looking at them with such admiration.
These tiny metal bits are nowhere close to covering the patterns on his palm, but they are more than enough to make him crack a smile.
It's almost like he's trying to see all his young daughter's hard work and growth in these two tiny medals.

As Bubble sits on her papa's shoulder, the shield on her back just happens to form a pauldron. She remembers how when her siblings were first recognized as braves, they all sat on their parents' shoulders, just like this.
When she was little, all she could ever see, no matter how hard she craned her neck, would be a small fragment of all the totem tattoos on his body.
Papa always said that when the time came that she could stand on his shoulder, she would see the full picture of his tattoos. Now, she finally sees them in their entirety.

The Cerato warrior leans his neck a bit to let his daughter see his latest tattoo.
In the large tribal totem, there is a small Cerato girl carrying a big, heavy shield, and charging forward.
She charges on, as if she will break through all the hurdles that lay in front of her, toward a boundless, limitless swath of land, free of any obstacles.
The 'map' that she saw when she was small is approaching completion. She is the one standing at the top of this mystical map. She is her papa's little pride.
