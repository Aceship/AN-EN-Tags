But after a long while, the stirrings abate, leaving the bushes in front of the opening to rustle in the wind, swaying and shuffling as they do.
Just as she's about to lose patience and tell her companion that they should head back to camp, a wild beast emerges from the cave without fanfare.
Its flesh is rugged, its hide sleek, and with a yawn it bares its coarse tusks for all to see, easily capable of mauling the throats of its prey.

The sheer fearsomeness of the beast makes Mulberry involuntarily bury her face halfway into her arms, leaving only a pair of eyes peeking out, furtively taking in the sight of it sniffing about its cave's entrance.
Seemingly assured no danger lurks nearby, it settles down and lets out a rumbling howl, as if calling for something.

Sure enough, a beastling soon waddles out from the cave, its gait unsteady.
After just a few steps, it tumbles heavily—perhaps the mud is too slick—and knocks its head on the senior beast's hind legs.
The beast isn't the least bit perturbed, simply craning its head around and lapping at the beastling's head, encouraging it to get up again.

[name="Blacknight"]Out in the barrens, there's plenty more like her. Loads and loads.
[charslot(slot = "M", name = "avg_476_blkngt_1#1$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]Few years back, I came across a slumberfoot. She was a tough little cub. The moment I saw her, I decided I wanted to tame her.
[charslot(slot = "M", name = "avg_476_blkngt_1#6$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]But I tried a few times to get close and communicate with her, and she kept refusing. Whenever she saw me, she just scurried straight away. Tasty food, a soft bed, nothing could make her care.
[charslot(slot = "M", name = "avg_476_blkngt_1#1$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]Then one time, by accident, she got hurt by her own prey. I saved her, took her back to camp, and treated her.
[charslot(slot = "M", name = "avg_476_blkngt_1#10$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]As she healed up, gradually, that tension she had around me gave way to a new familiarity.
[charslot(slot = "M", name = "avg_476_blkngt_1#10$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]Thought I'd managed to tame her, so I stopped keeping an eye on her round the clock.
[charslot(slot = "M", name = "avg_476_blkngt_1#7$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]But after a short hunting trip, I came back to camp and she was gone. Left nothing but the little cap I knitted her.
[charslot(slot = "M", name = "avg_476_blkngt_1#7$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]I was furious. Imagine how hard it is to even get a hold of yarn in the barrens... I thought she loved that cap.
[charslot(slot = "M", name = "avg_476_blkngt_1#1$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]So I followed her tracks. Went after her.
[charslot(slot = "M", name = "avg_476_blkngt_1#10$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]And when I found her, she was rolling about in the dunes, absolutely grimy. But she was happy as could be, the happiest I'd ever seen her.
[charslot(slot = "M", name = "avg_476_blkngt_1#10$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]So I just turned around and left. In that instant, I learned. She didn't belong to me. She belonged to those dunes, to that huge old desert.
