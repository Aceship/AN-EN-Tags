Some people say mercenaries are like MREs. Meals, ready-to-eat.
Can be eaten right out of the bag. Disposable. High efficiency, low risk. The best kind of field ration.
But if given a choice, practically everyone would choose to eat fresh, hot food. And practically no one would choose to risk their lives just to earn their next meal.
If given a choice.

[name="Mercenary A"]  We're lucky we even have canned food. You got any idea what happens to mercs who lose their supplies out in the barrens?
[name="Mercenary A"]  You collapse on the ground out here, and scavenging Originium slugs think you're a carcass and start gnawing on your clothes from your legs up. You're still conscious by the time they get to your flesh.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="avg_npc_007",focus=2)]

[name="Cutter"]  We're in the barrens, and there's no wind. Fire means smoke, which means anybody can spot us from miles away.
[name="Cutter"]  Might as well be broadcasting 'there's a caravan here' to all the other mercenaries in the area.
[name="Cutter"]  We're escorting goods this time, so we can't afford to blow our position.
[Character(name="avg_npc_007")]
[name="Mercenary B"]  Ooh, the little girl's talking like a pro now. How many runs have you made at your age?
[Character(name="char_301_cutter_1")]
[name="Cutter"]  Too many to count.
[name="Cutter"]  Done pretty much everything except fraud and trafficking. I've probably been doing this longer than you, too.
[Character(name="avg_npc_007")]
[name="Mercenary B"]  You talk a big game. But how do you know when I got in the biz?
[Character(name="char_301_cutter_1")]
[name="Cutter"]  Your knife.
[Character(name="avg_npc_007")]
[name="Mercenary B"]  What?
[Character(name="char_301_cutter_1")]
[name="Cutter"]  It's one of the latest from Raythean, put out just last year. Brand new materials, and half the weight of the previous generation. No signs of wear and tear on your belt sheath either, so you can't have used other knives before.
[Character(name="avg_npc_007")]
[name="Mercenary B"]  Impressive. You sure know your stuff.
[name="Mercenary B"]  To tell you the truth, I'm only doing this because I lost my farm in a Catastrophe. Who the heck would take a job that puts a bounty on their head if they had any land to grow crops on?
[name="Mercenary B"]  Heh. Still, I might be the newbie here, but I've never screwed up a job.
[name="Mercenary B"]  If we bump into any bandits, I'll show you what I'm capable of.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Mercenary A"]  Bah. Don't jinx us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_007")]
[name="Mercenary B"]  Can't you take a joke? We did a great job covering up our trail, and we only got our route just before setting off.
[Character(name="char_301_cutter_1")]
[name="Cutter"]  That's the best way to keep it secret.
[name="Cutter"]  Some employers prepare multiple route maps in advance and keep them sealed. Before departure, a middleman will randomly select one and hand it to the mercenaries.
[name="Cutter"]  Then we're allowed to refuse the job if the seal has been tampered with.
[name="Cutter"]  This avoids direct contact between the mercenaries and the employers, and also eliminates the risk of leaks. Our client kept things professional this time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_007")]
[name="Mercenary B"]  What a stand-up guy. Makes you wonder what the hell is in these boxes to be worth all this trouble.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="avg_npc_007",focus=1)]
[name="Mercenary A"]  We just drop off the goods at the destination, grab our money, and leave. Nothing else matters.
[Character(name="avg_npc_007")]
[name="Mercenary B"]  True. But when they're paying this much just to move 'em, they must be worth a pretty penny! Makes me feel like I'm in the big leagues now, hahaha!
[name="Mercenary B"]  Soon as I get my hands on that cash, I'm gonna find a good bar and drink myself silly.
[name="Mercenary B"]  A few more contracts like this, maybe I'll even head south, buy another plot of land, and open another brewery! Hahaha!
[name="Mercenary B"]  What about you guys? What are you gonna do with the money?
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Mercenary A"]  Can't say I share your optimism, so I'll need to find a weaponsmith for crossbow maintenance first.
[Character(name="avg_npc_007")]
