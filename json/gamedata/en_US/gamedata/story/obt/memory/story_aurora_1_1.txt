[name="Aurora"]I became infected with Oripathy because I couldn't do enough. I won't let it happen again.
[name="Aurora"]I don't want to disappoint you, disappoint anybody else, or disappoint myself!
[name="Aurora"]This is my choice, and I'll see it through.
[name="Aurora"]How could I talk about protecting all of Kjerag, if I can't even protect you, here and now?
[name="Aurora"]You've got the experience, Maggy! Tell me what to do to protect both of us once it's activated!

[name="Magallan"]You thought you had to shield me with your torso? That's what your body language said. Protecting yourself is always the priority on the Icefields.

[name="Aurora"]Not saying that we can stop them from happening, but if we had operated according to plan, we would have been back at base, going through the supplies in safety, while watching the hail fall outside...

[name="Magallan"]I knew you'd think that way. Irregular events are a regularity when you do research this far north.
[name="Magallan"]I've encountered blizzards that kept me in an ice hole for five full days. I've encountered avalanches that buried all my drones. And don't get me started on invisible cracks in glaciers...
[name="Magallan"]The north doesn't change for anybody. We get what we want from it on our own, and pay the appropriate price.
[name="Magallan"]A few months of solitude, or some kind of injury... this is what we deal with all the time.
[name="Magallan"]The north doesn't cause a Catastrophe just because you decided to delay a few days. It does what it wants, and we just happened to run into it. Don't blame yourself.

Magallan takes out a heavily-damaged drone.

Its camera module is connected to a data cable, and the screen is showing an intermittent video recording.
The little corner of sky visible from the edge of the shield is obscured by clouds and hail. Then, a single ray of light shines through.
Like a veil of silk, it slowly begins to cover the clouds.
It's at that time that Aurora lowers her head, and the shield's Originium circuit glows a bright blue, indicating overload.
Aurora presses at the barrier, forming an impregnable line of defense, as Originium and hail bounce off the shield.
The sky shines brightly with a myriad of colors.

[name="Magallan"]I saw this recording when I was taking stock of the remaining supplies. The drone's camera kept running, showing that we actually encountered the aurora that you wanted to see.
[Character(name="avg_248_mgllan_1#5$1")]
[name="Magallan"]But it was me who proposed that we stay two more days, Aurora.
[name="Magallan"]I know the north better than you do, and I know better what we're dealing with here.
[name="Magallan"]That's why I wanted to wait until you saw the aurora with your own eyes.

[name="Aurora"]Maggy—
[name="Aurora"]My goal has always been to achieve what I wanted under my own strength and hard work.
[name="Aurora"]What I care about is that I managed to protect ourselves from the hail, and that you haven't been infected! And I completed the project I've been working on for so long!
[name="Aurora"]Now I can tell my parents and siblings that I never stopped trying, even with my illness. I achieved a lot, and I'm gradually realizing my dream!
[name="Aurora"]And I can tell myself that I made the right choice. It's not about seeing the aurora; it's about successfully accomplishing these things.
[Character(name="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1")]
[name="Aurora"]That's why this video is even more precious to me than seeing the aurora with my own eyes!
