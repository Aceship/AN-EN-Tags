[charslot]
[name="Boastful Student"]Oh, I can already hear the kids reading their books out loud...
In an empty plot at the edge of the village, a dozen university students are huddled together and chattering in excitement.
Beside them is a newly built two-story building, standing somewhat wobbly.

The boastful student pulls out a bottle of champagne and shakes it violently.

Agni points at the villagers standing at a distance.
They act as though neither the newly built school nor the university students are even there. They simply focus on their hard labor. Not one of them has even a hint of a smile on their face.

Aside from teaching, Agni also gained a certain standing among the villagers thanks to her experience playing with fire, something she'd done since she was a child—

When Agni sees the village headman so worked up, she remembers what her father just told her.

Not far from the village, a gigantic mining platform drives right past. The vibration is no less intense than the tremors that precede a Catastrophe.
Agni staggers, finally realizing why the Originium Slugs do not build their nests here anymore.

The village headman leaves Agni behind and starts walking toward his home.
After a short distance, he turns around to find her still standing there.
'What a stubborn girl,' he thinks to himself, 'but she'll end up like her father in the end. Maybe a decent person, maybe less of a pain in the arse, but much more dangerous.'
But just as he thinks that and is about to turn and go on his way, he sees her grab the bottle of champagne on the ground.
He sees her hold it with both hands and violently shake it up and down, as though what is trapped inside are not champagne bubbles, but somebody's soul.
He sees how she has almost completely exhausted herself just to shake that bottle. And when she's completely spent, she lifts the bottle up high, pointing it toward the sky.
Pop!
He isn't able to hear it very well.
But he can see it clearly. The cork flies straight into the sky. Perhaps it will ultimately land in the rubble, or perhaps not.
The last thing he sees is Agni smashing the bottle onto the ground, before walking away in long strides.
