[name="Dur-nar"]There's a few scouts around who don't have anything to do right now. You can give them a list of places your sister is likely to go to. They'll be happy to help.

But she only has her eyes on the road ahead, as she navigates bend after bend.
As the clock strikes twelve, she rounds the last bend, and arrives at her rented apartment.

Astesia says nothing. She buries her face in her sister's chest, sobbing.
She can't keep her emotions in check, and she doesn't want her sister to see her face.
Astgenne knows that, and so she stands there, holding her sister in her arms, allowing the tears to soak through her clothes.
For a long time they stand there, until both of them have calmed down sufficiently, and Astesia takes out her key and opens the door.

[name="Astgenne"]I hear you're already getting interviewed by the press?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_274_Astesia_1#7",focus="r")]
[name="Astesia"]Yeah, they just asked some pretty standard questions. But I also got questions from two foreign scholars.
[name="Astesia"]We exchanged contact information, and we may be able to work together to improve the model and promote its usage in academia.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_274_Astesia_1#2",focus="r")]
[name="Astesia"]As for Mother and Father...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_274_Astesia_1#1",focus="r")]
[name="Astesia"]I'm sure they expressed their dissatisfaction with me in the sternest tone, staring straight ahead.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_135_halo_1#11$1",focus="l")]
[name="Astgenne"]They've always been like this. They've never changed.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_135_halo_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Astgenne"](Fake voice) 'Astesia needs to know her place in the family.'
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_135_halo_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Astgenne"]They're obviously mad at you.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_274_Astesia_1#7",focus="r")]
[name="Astesia"]Haha, don't say that, Genne.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_135_halo_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Astgenne"]What are you gonna do now?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_274_Astesia_1#7",focus="r")]
[name="Astesia"]We'll stay in Trimounts for a while longer. We've been too busy to go sightseeing or shopping.
[name="Astesia"]There's still time left on this apartment lease.
[name="Astesia"]I'll go back and report to Father once everything here is taken care of, and once things have cooled down a little.
[name="Astesia"]I'll tell him that this was the fruit of me and my sister's labor, and that I won't let him put his name on it.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_135_halo_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Astgenne"]Finally, you've come around.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_274_Astesia_1#1",focus="r")]
[name="Astesia"]What about you, Genne? Are you going back to Rhine? I hear your old mentor is back with a directorship.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_135_halo_1#12$1",focus="l")]
[name="Astgenne"]No way. Rumor has it he's even more cantankerous when bossing people around these days.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_135_halo_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Astgenne"]But if I'm being honest, Director Clooney's current project is... intriguing.
[name="Astgenne"]How could I not be interested in a form of energy that can send a building into the sky?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_135_halo_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Astgenne"]But that's not a good enough reason for me to go back to working under a man like him. No opportunity is worth that.
[name="Astgenne"]I've made up my mind. I have no regrets.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_274_Astesia_1#7",focus="r")]
[name="Astesia"]I'll follow your example, Genne.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_135_halo_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Astgenne"]You're already my example.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_274_Astesia_1#7",focus="r")]
[name="Astesia"]Well, there are worse things than your sister complimenting you.
[name="Astesia"]Let's eat out today.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_135_halo_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Astgenne"]Alright!

[name="Astgenne"]By the way...
[name="Astesia"]Yes?
[name="Astgenne"]Give me a heads-up if you're going back home.
[name="Astesia"]I thought you didn't want to go back.
[name="Astgenne"]I want Mr. Urbica to know that the two of us are a united front against him.
[name="Astesia"]Now that's exaggerating things a bit...
[name="Astgenne"]Well, I won't go if you don't want me to.
[name="Astesia"]That's not what I meant.
[name="Astesia"]......

[name="Astesia"]Let's go together.
