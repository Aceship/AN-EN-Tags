[name="Pudding"]In theory. According to the previously established parameters for the Originium substation and power equipment, at any rate.
[name="Pudding"]Celica also helped research and develop the tech, so modifying the equipment and laying out the cables shouldn't be too difficult for her.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_4004_pudd_1#8$1",focus="r")]
[name="Pudding"]The key issue is controlling the power load. If you look at the power flow calculations here, this part should be able to function normally after modification...

Light.
