[name="Specter"]I always drifted wherever they went, watching the domes in my mother's blueprints gradually take shape, watching the cities sprawl out from the seabed in all directions.
[name="Specter"]Her artistic sensibilities influenced the children born under those domes, myself included.
[name="Specter"]City after city, dome after dome.
[name="Specter"]I witnessed the majesty of creating something from nothing, plus the joy of starting all over again.
[name="Specter"]She saved the abyssal sea, plucking it out from the nihilistic dark.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#4", name2="avg_1023_ghost2_1#12$1", focus=2)]
[name="Specter"]And I hoped I could be someone like her.
[name="Specter"]Every city I stayed at gave me the chance to choose. Music, sport, drawing. Experiencing Ægir's rich culture in the concrete details broadened my horizons.
[name="Specter"]I thought I'd be choosing forever, until I saw that statue. It was then I decided to become a sculptor myself.
[name="Specter"]How valuable that gigantic, flawless, snow-white figure seemed, stood before the gloom of the ocean. You gazed up at it, looked over its posture, and unconsciously, you went to mimic it.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#4", name2="avg_1023_ghost2_1#3$1", focus=2)]

[name="Gladiia"]Being chosen to become an Abyssal Hunter far from implies that you must renounce the right to pursue your dreams.
