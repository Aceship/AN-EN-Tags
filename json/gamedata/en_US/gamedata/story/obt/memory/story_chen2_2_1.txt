[name="Contestant"]My family's from a Singas village.
[name="Contestant"]One day, a fight broke out between the Singas and True BolÃ­varians. Our whole village was destroyed by True BolÃ­varians. Lots of people died.
[name="Contestant"]I was lucky enough to be hunting up in the mountains at the time, and that saved my life. I ran away as soon as I saw what had happened to the village.
[name="Contestant"]I wanted to be a soldier, but the army didn't want me. I had no choice. I heard it's easy to make a decent living here, so I came.
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1#5",name2="avg_npc_205",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]That must be a painful memory. Sorry for bringing it up.
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1#5",name2="avg_npc_205",focus=2)]

[name="Ch'en"]What makes you say that?
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1",name2="avg_npc_205",focus=2)]
[name="Contestant"]I'm 35 now. I spent some 20 years back in my hometown, and it hasn't even been 10 years since I moved here, but sometimes...
[name="Contestant"]Sometimes it feels like the life I once had was all a lie.
[name="Contestant"]Back then, I thought it was the right thing to do to help out, but when I heard what you said just now, it felt like it's been a really long time since I heard anyone say anything like that. It's been a long time since I even thought that way myself, too.
[name="Contestant"]To tell the truth, if the shoe was on the other foot at the police station, if I was a bystander like you instead of someone asking for help, I definitely wouldn't have lent a hand.
[name="Contestant"]And I knew it was pointless to go to the cops, but I was pissed. I didn't expect anyone there would help me, but then you showed up.
[name="Contestant"]In this city, you can get lots of things done if you have money, but you can forget about it if you don't.
[name="Contestant"]And if you want to climb the ladder, your best bet would be to try your luck, join a gang, gamble, or steal. You'd be an idiot to try to get there by working your ass off.
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1",name2="avg_npc_205",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]The championship is trying your luck?
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1",name2="avg_npc_205",focus=2)]
[name="Contestant"]Of course. I'm a coward. I'm not brave enough to gamble, let alone steal. For someone like me, the championship's the most stable way to hit it big.
[name="Contestant"]Men like me don't actually try to win. Just making it through the prelim earns you some decent money. If you win the first round, you get yourself some fame and even more money.

[name="Hoshiguma"]So she paid Lady Candela a visit and asked her to consider increasing your performance bonuses.
[name="Hoshiguma"]And out of respect for Miss Ch'en, Lady Candela allocated a decent amount of money. Anyone from the station who has made a meaningful contribution will get a bonus.

[name="Hoshiguma"]And I can name all kinds of reasons.
[name="Hoshiguma"]First, you just got here. You may be brimming with charisma, but they still won't bow down to you right away. Just think about how long it took you to get those nitpickers to work with you when you first joined the bureau.
[name="Hoshiguma"]At times like this, moolah is the simplest way to get someone on board.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=2)]

[character(name="avg_npc_203_1",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]I never caved.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Plus, it's a little arrogant to ignore what you've got on hand and rely only on yourself.
[name="Hoshiguma"]And that's especially if it's money, authority, and power that you have available. You might as well use it.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Is that the impression everyone had of me?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]You've put in enough effort over the years to convince everyone in Lungmen. This isn't Lungmen, though, and you aren't planning on staying here that long, so how will you prove yourself?
[name="Hoshiguma"]Next, both of us heard the guy's rambling loud and clear. Do you really think the cops turned out like this because they don't want to do their work?
[name="Hoshiguma"]Were they born this bad? Do they really think it's right for cops to get in bed with gangs, and they are actually happy to release someone as soon as the phone rings?
[name="Hoshiguma"]This is a police station. They know they're the police.
[name="Hoshiguma"]It's not that they don't want to stand up to all that. They can't. They're too afraid to. They might've had the courage before, but reality wiped it all out. Trying to reason with them is a futile exercise. Might as well do what you know works.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Those are all reasons, and you should also know you shouldn't have done that.
[name="Hoshiguma"]But you did, and that's the truth.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1",focus=2)]
