As the three of them start rebuilding the tower, Shining glances over at the owner of the house.
He is seated by the window, longsword still in hand.
Meanwhile, his child is sitting with the two women, pushing some of the fallen blocks in front of Nightingale before continuing to stack them up.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_661_1#1$1")]
[name="Villager's Child"]One more... to go... And, done!
[name="Villager's Child"]We can start playing the game now!
[name="Villager's Child"]The rules are really easy. First, you roll the dice, then you pull out the same number of blocks from the tower and stack them on top. Whoever knocks it over loses!

[name="Villager's Child"]You're up next, nice lady in black.
[charslot]
Shining takes the die next and casts it.
She takes note of the number, and turns to the wooden tower.
While removing a block isn't inherently difficult, the tower will naturally start falling apart as the game progresses.
Past choices and occurrences accumulate, stacking up layer by layer, and applying ever more pressure on the future.
A sensation she finds disagreeable.
But rules are rules, and she must abide by them.
And so, another block is stacked on top.

As soon as they step into the village, they are surrounded by a constant chorus of surprised murmurs, as if they were beasts that had broken loose.
But Shining doesn't care about that. The Victorians won't see them again after they're done buying food.

She only wanted to buy some food to fill her stomach, but she has no choice but to hastily flee the village in the end.

When she focuses on the present again, the three of them had already been playing together for quite some time.
Several of the wooden tower levels are supported by only a single block, yet the rickety tower somehow still maintains an uneasy equilibrium.
It won't be long until a winner is decided.

[charslot]
The block she grabs is wedged so tightly that all blocks above it wobble every time Nightingale tries to move it.
Nightingale and the child continue staring intently at the block, neither noticing that Shining and the owner of the house have stood up at the same time.

[charslot]
She tries again and again, hoping that the tower's center of gravity might change.
But the pressure exerted on that single block of wood does not let up.
What would Shining do? She ponders.
She remembers that Shining would draw out the blocks faster than the eye can see, without giving the tower even a chance to wobble.
She prepares to give it a try.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_661_1#1$1")]

[name="Villager's Child"]Yay! I win!

For whatever reason, the young girl takes Nightingale's hand and starts dancing around, as if they had both won the game.
Her pure, genuine emotions send a ripple through Nightingale's stony heart.
