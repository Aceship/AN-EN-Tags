[name="Istina"]I've returned here again, as I hoped to.
[name="Istina"]On the road to Leithanien, I imagined my reunion with my parents under countless different circumstances... imagined how to convey my decision to them, and show how I'd grown...
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_195_glassb_2#2",focus="m")]

[name="Istina"]The day I arrived, Papa insisted he'd cook, wanting to make me shchi to bring back the taste of home. After going through several markets, we never found the yellow onions, so we had to buy wild ones to substitute...
[name="Istina"]It was my first time eating wild onion shchi, and the taste wasn't unbearable... just somewhat pungent.
[name="Istina"]They loved Lada's gift, and we used the molds to bake cookies, an endless amount. We spent days eating them...
