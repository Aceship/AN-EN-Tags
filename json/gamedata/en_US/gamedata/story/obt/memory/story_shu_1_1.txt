Jingzhe, when insects wake.
The weather finally clears up after a few days of early spring rain.
A square platform sits in the center of the public square—it resembles both a stage and altar with a statue silently standing on top.
It is a sculpture of a simply dressed woman with facial features hard to perceive, but one can easily tell where her gaze is looking.
A boy carefully offers a verdant seedling to the statue with a deferential bow.

[name="He Sheng"]So why does this statue face southward?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2025_shu_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Shu"]Shennong labored her entire life away just to prevent her fellow man from going hungry and cold. She would've been very attached to the people of her hometown.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2025_shu_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Shu"]That's probably where she was looking, in her final moments.

[name="He Sheng"]Actually, what made you decide to become an Nongye Tianshi in the first place?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2025_shu_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Shu"]When I was young, I learned how it felt to starve, once. Since then, I decided I wouldn't let anyone else go through that.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4119_wanqin_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="He Sheng"]So you also suffered a famine...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2025_shu_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Shu"]Well... that was long, long ago.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4119_wanqin_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="He Sheng"]Just like Shennong...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2025_shu_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Shu"]Dahuang has many farmers and Nongye Tianshis that have more or less have similar reasons as to why they're here.

The sun gradually rises as the spring breeze blows warmth into the air and onto the people.
The wind pushes the clouds away, letting a slanted ray of sunlight shine onto the statue's face.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4119_wanqin_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="He Sheng"]We still don't know if they were historical people or just myths. Could it be that Shennong wasn't just one woman?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4119_wanqin_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="He Sheng"]She only hoped for more to follow in her footsteps, instead of remembering who she was, so she hid her identity.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4119_wanqin_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="He Sheng"]But this way, no one really remembers the person she was...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2025_shu_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Shu"]If someone like that really existed, do you think she'd care if the people here remembered her name at all, if she could see what Dahuang has become?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2025_shu_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Shu"]Or maybe she was just shy and didn't want to leave her name and likeness behind.

A fowlbeast brings up a small yellow flower in its beak and drops it on the statue's bamboo hat.
It seems to have picked a good nesting spot, and fetches several more flowers with branches in bunches. Yellow flowers soon cover the brim of the hat.
The flowers bloom so beautifully after that parting, I wonder if you still know the way home.
