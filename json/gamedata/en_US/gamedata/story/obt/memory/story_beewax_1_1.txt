Ankhesena opens her mouth only to find herself unable to say what she was going to say.
Once someone has set their mind on crossing a desert, they can no longer turn back. Because the sands that blow with the wind will undoubtedly swallow the path they'd taken.
And the courage they took so long to gather is never enough for them to look back at their unrecognizable past.
