[name="Kal'tsit"]Blaze, how long has it been since you came on board?
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4")]
[name="Blaze"]Hm... Let me see... Almost a year.
[name="Blaze"]Time flies.
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Time leaves us all behind.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Your growth in the past year has been apparent to all of us. Even if it wasn't your intention to prove anything with your actions, you have indeed shown us what you are capable of.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Ace and many other operators all think very highly of you.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#8")]
[name="Blaze"]Why are we talking about this all of a sudden? I'm starting to blush...
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Your body temperature is normal.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#6")]
[name="Blaze"]I'm doing what I can to hold it back here!
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]......
[name="Kal'tsit"]I suppose you already know what I summoned you for.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4")]
[name="Blaze"]I have my guesses...
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Very well. I'll get to the point.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Ever since Rhodes Island was established, we've had many members come and go. I won't say much about that.
[name="Kal'tsit"]We welcome those who share our ideology, but, of course, ideologies are not to be imposed on anyone.
[name="Kal'tsit"]That said... We need members who can walk this journey with us.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Blaze, it's natural if you aren't ready, and none of us will force you to do anything.
[name="Kal'tsit"]But if you are ready...

[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4")]
[name="Blaze"]I do, but... I don't know for sure.
[name="Blaze"]There are only so many things that Dr. Kal'tsit would talk to me about, especially all formally like that.
[name="Blaze"]So I guess maybe she's giving me a chance to do what you do?
[character(name="char_014_riope")]
[name="Ace"]More or less. Looks like you know the score.

[name="Blaze"]Don't worry so much about that. Smile. Yep, that's right. Turn the frown upside down. There's no need to apologize. I wasn't trying to hide anything anyway.
[name="Blaze"]Well, you heard it yourself. I have a good idea why Dr. Kal'tsit wants to see me.
[name="Blaze"]If my hunch is correct, you probably know what this is about, right, Amiya?
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]Yeah...
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]I knew it.
[name="Blaze"]Were you trying to cheer me up because you were worried it was giving me too much stress? You're so cute, Amiya!

[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]Okay, I'll knock it off. Let's get serious.
[name="Blaze"]I'm really not that confident in myself, and I really think I have a ways to go, too.
[name="Blaze"]Look, the thing is... if I didn't have the weapon that Mechanist designed, I don't think I could've been any help to my team at all.
[name="Blaze"]*Sigh*...
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]I mean it, Amiya. Can I really do it?
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]When I heard you ask Ace just now, I thought I had to tell you how I feel...
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]I'm listening, Amiya. I always listen to what you have to say.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]Are you working hard because you're trying to earn some kind of title, Blaze?
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]Of course not.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]Right? Blaze, you're putting in so much work not to become something. It's actually the opposite. It's because you are who you are that we think you are the right person for the job...
[name="Amiya"]And everyone trusts you already, don't they?
[name="Amiya"]Everyone who came back from the mission in Siracusa told me this—
[name="Amiya"]'It's all thanks to Blaze.'
[name="Amiya"]'If it wasn't for her cutting open that wall, we couldn't have finished the mission.'
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]T-That doesn't say anything about me. It's all thanks to what Mechanist gave me...
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]But no one else could've used such massive equipment as well as you did.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]Uhh...
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]If it wasn't for you, Ace might've gone with a safer plan.
[name="Amiya"]See? Everyone trusts you, and you are an inseparable part of the team now. This is the most important thing.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]Amiya...
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]I'm just trying to say—We aren't giving you the title so that you can take the job.
[name="Amiya"]It's your own actions that decided all of this, Blaze. You chose to become a certain kind of person, and you have chosen to take on that responsibility.
[name="Amiya"]If all we wanted was combat capability, we could've asked somebody else. If we wanted a big pile of muscle, we didn't have to ask you.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]Does that mean what I think it means?
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]Uh, no, probably not...
[name="Amiya"]I-I'm just trying to say that strength isn't the only thing Rhodes Island is looking for!
[name="Amiya"]You should believe in yourself, Blaze, and believe in us!
[name="Amiya"]If you've made your decision, I'm ready to go with you.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#10",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]

[name="Blaze"]Okay, okay... Sheesh, my whole face is going red.
[name="Blaze"]Enough, little rabbit. I know what you're trying to say.
[name="Blaze"]You're right. Jeez, you really have a way with words.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]Ehehe...
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]Okay, it's almost time. I gotta pull it together and go to my meeting now.
[name="Blaze"]I've never once thought of running away, you know?
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#4",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]Oh, I-I'll come with you!
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#8",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]Great! Let's take a relaxing walk together. How come you look like you're more nervous than I am?
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#8",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]D-Do I...?
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#7",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]Yep. Smile! That frown ruins your cute little face.

[name="Amiya"]Nn... hehe.
[character(name="char_017_homura_3#8",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]

Blaze walks down the long, dim hallway. The light above her head gently sways as the landship continues its march forward, causing her shadow on the ground to waver side to side as well.

The staircase leading down is long and dark, as though truly bottomless. Blaze takes a deep breath and begins her descent, leaving Amiya behind.
She must walk the rest of the way by herself.
At the bottom of the staircase, Blaze can make out a long table in a room that structurally seems cold as ice, with a warm, yellow light casting upon its steel beams.
A few familiar figures, some less so, stand under the lamplight.
