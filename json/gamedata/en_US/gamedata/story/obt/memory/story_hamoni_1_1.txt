[name="Rosalie"]—Ah, darling Rita.
[name="Rosalie"]It's been an awful while since we last got to chat, hasn't it? Such a shame we couldn't be in the same accommodation like we were before.
[name="Rosalie"]Really, Royal Guard runs far more arduous militarization drills than either of us could've imagined, wouldn't you say?
[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#5")]
[name="Rita"]Did you make it to the entrance exams on the day?
[Character(name="avg_npc_228_1#3")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#6")]
[name="Rita"]No, nothing... Here, your Introduction to Military Science. The notes you left in there were very helpful, much appreciated.
[name="Rita"]I was going to give it back the morning of the exam, but I left before I saw you. It's been sitting in the back of my mind.
[name="Rita"]Want to get dinner together? We can catch up on the way. You can pick a dress for me to wear on my off day.

[Character(name="avg_npc_229_1#5")]

[name="Rita"]The last time I ran across you, you were going to that army staff officer's granddaughter's soirée. Military families like that are always on the lookout for a few trustworthy aides to groom.

[name="Kind-Faced Noble"]Could you elaborate?
[Character(name="avg_npc_228_1#1",name2="avg_npc_175",focus=1)]
[name="Harmonie"]Don't you mind, that was just a little private monologue.
[name="Harmonie"]My opinion is, if we carry on like this, my staff and the skin of your throat may just threaten to close their own distance.
[Dialog]
[character]
But upon those words, Harmonie stows her staff away.
[Character(name="avg_npc_228_1#1")]
[name="Harmonie"]—You're invited to leave now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_175")]
[name="Kind-Faced Noble"]Madam, if you're declining because the difficulty of disengaging from your intel work worries you, then please trust that we have methods sufficient to aid you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_228_1#1")]
[name="Harmonie"]It seems you think I'm dictated to hate my life and my lot in it.
[name="Harmonie"]You've made a—not uncommon misunderstanding, I'll say. Conspiracies bury themselves all throughout life. So many little incidents are secretly the grand designs of master architects like yourself, am I wrong?
[Character(name="avg_npc_175")]
[name="Kind-Faced Noble"]You'll have seen that sort of thing a great deal, as an intelligence worker.
[Character(name="avg_npc_228_1#1")]
[name="Harmonie"]Quite. I've gotten fairly sick of seeing it, and even fairly sick of doing it.
[name="Harmonie"]The fact of the matter is, nobody forced me into intelligence work. Some professors selected me, I agreed, and that was that.
[name="Harmonie"]Do you know something? If I really, truly hadn't the power to control my own life, I'd be compelled to kill you here and now, so as to avoid you bringing any hassle to my door.
[Character(name="avg_npc_228_1#4")]
[name="Harmonie"]But I very much take a liking to you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_175")]
[name="Kind-Faced Noble"]......

Harmonie turns away with light grace.

Inside the hall, the ensemble bows and readies to begin performing. The bright fixtures shine through the floor to ceiling windows, outlining her in a glowing silhouette.

With carefreeness, she lifts her arms, and spins a full circle.
There in the courtyard, she dances on her own in brisk, spry steps.

The Feline named Harmonie gives no answer.
