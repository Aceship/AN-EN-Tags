[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_502_Yato_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Yato"]It's the first blade I received after arriving on Rhodes Island. It was smelted with fragments of my blade from my Higashi days.

[name="Vulcan"]Hmm... If you still want to use it, I do have a method we can try, although it's an old technique.

Yato almost offers the blade once more, but her hand rests on the hilt as she looks at the Operators around her.
She sees several pairs of young eyes, all laser-focused on her.
She suddenly realizes it is she herself reflected in them.

[name="Yato"]Since no one could beat me today, I've decided...
[name="Yato"]From today onwards, as long as I'm here, anyone can pick up that blade to spar with me. I'll always be happy to oblige.
[name="Yato"]I look forward to seeing you next time, Rhodes Island newcomers.

She watches the blade sink slowly into the forge, its structure as brilliant as the blazing sun, and gradually melt.
Finally, its shape is gone completely, leaving only a ball of red liquid.
Like fresh blood.
