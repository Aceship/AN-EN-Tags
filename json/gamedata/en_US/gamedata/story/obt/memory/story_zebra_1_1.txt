In the blood-red glow of the fire, each person is reduced to a vague silhouette, cast over the mottled ruins.
Once they fought side by side, through the valley of the shadow of death.
Yet now, only hatred and animosity remain in their gazes towards one another.

The years-long campaign has taken these people—far from their homes and their families—and left them with no one but their fellow troops.
It's only natural for those from the same hometown to look after one another, unable to bear their companions suffering even the slightest abuse.
But under such innately oppressive circumstances, strife still remains common.
