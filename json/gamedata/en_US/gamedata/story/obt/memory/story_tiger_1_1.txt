[name="Dobermann"]  I am not going to waste time pointing out how many incorrect assumptions you've made in that one sentence.
[name="Dobermann"]  Briefly, the training grounds are not a place to vent your private moods. Operators do not learn from one another with the goal of causing permanent harm to the other party.
[name="Dobermann"]  Once you've gotten things straight, you can come back again. The new recruits very much need the genuine combat guidance your experience provides.
