[character(name="avg_npc_279_1$1")]
[name="Hawker A"] Oh my, it really is you, Matterhorn. Heh, so what brings you around these parts today?
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#9$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] I've had some spare time lately, so I thought it would be nice to cook dinner for the Master.
[character(name="avg_npc_274_1$1")]
[name="Hawker B"] Good, good. Don't let your cooking skills go to waste. C'mere, go ahead and take this strip of steak. I remember the Master enjoyed them when he was young, and you'd always take a whole bag with you.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#9$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] Thank you for your kindness, but let's get five pounds of tenderloin first.
[character(name="avg_npc_279_1$1")]
[name="Hawker A"] Oh, and the youngest was just a little girl at the time. Whenever you'd go shopping, she'd follow right behind you, tugging at the hem of your clothes.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#9$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] Hahaha, Ensia was indeed quite small back then—also extremely curious, and she refused to stay indoors. She would make me bring her along.
[character(name="avg_npc_274_1$1")]
[name="Hawker B"] Here, the tenderloin's good to go. Hmm, the Master's tastes have changed, eh? Didn't he used to prefer short ribs?
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#8$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] Yes, the Master... grew up.
[character(name="avg_npc_279_1$1")]
[name="Hawker A"] Matterhorn, about the older sister... Oh no, I mean, excuse this addled old geezer. How has the Saintess been? All of us... miss her a lot.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#8$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] The Saintess... has been in good health. Everything is well.

[name="Hawker B"] Kjeragandr watches over her, so of course it is. You worry too much, old man.
[name="Hawker B"] After all, the reason we can continue our humble little lives here is because the Saintess managed to stabilize the situation at a critical time.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#9$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] She is as bright as the snow itself. If she was able to deal with that crisis so calmly, lesser problems would surely pose no issue to her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_279_1$1", name2="avg_npc_274_1$1", focus=1)]

[name="Cliffheart"] Y-yeah, maybe... I'm starting to feel a little full after all.
[name="Cliffheart"] But, there's still so much left over... You spent so long making all this delicious food, I'd feel bad if it went to waste.
[Character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#4$1", name2="avg_199_yak_1#9$1", focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"] And I'd feel bad if your stomach exploded from overeating.

[name="Cliffheart"] Uncle Matterhorn...

[name="Matterhorn"] As long as you enjoy your meals with a smile on your face, that's enough for me.

[name="Cliffheart"] But, but, if my brother was here, then we'd be able to finish.
[Character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1", name2="avg_199_yak_1#8$1", focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"] Are you frustrated that he couldn't make it?
[Character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1", name2="avg_199_yak_1#8$1", focus=1)]
[name="Cliffheart"] Well, yeah. We haven't sat down for a face-to-face dinner in forever! He always leaves in a rush in the morning and doesn't come home until late at night. I barely even get to see him.
[name="Cliffheart"] Say, when I snuck up to see my sister and messed up his plans, that must've really made him mad, huh?
[Character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1", name2="avg_199_yak_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"] Lady Ensia... You didn't do anything wrong, and the Master... He wouldn't blame you for it either.
[Character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#2$1", name2="avg_199_yak_1#2$1", focus=1)]
[name="Cliffheart"] If only there'd come a day when our whole family could gather at one table to eat and talk and laugh, all in front of your delicious cooking...
[Character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#2$1", name2="avg_199_yak_1#8$1", focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"] Don't lose heart, milady...
[name="Matterhorn"] I'll always be here for you. If there's anything you want to eat, I'll make it for you.

[name="SilverAsh"] Matterhorn, were you waiting for me this whole time?
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#2$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"] I thought I sent Courier to convey that I wouldn't be able to make it back for dinner.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#8$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] I kept worrying that you'd be too busy to eat, and what if you were hungry when you came back? So I decided to wait a bit longer.
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#9$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"] Very well then. What do you have to eat?
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#8$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] Whatever you'd like, Sir. I'll make it for you right now.
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#2$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"] No need. Just heat something up, and that'll suffice.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#4$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] Surely... that won't do. I only have leftovers.

[name="SilverAsh"] I see. I'll try to get back a bit earlier tomorrow.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#1$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] Understood. As for tonight...
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#6$1")]

[name="Matterhorn"] Sir, this is all that's left over from tonight's dinner.
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"] What a feast. You must've worked hard to make all this, Matterhorn.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#3$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] It is my job as your retainer.
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#3$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"] What happened to your hand?
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#9$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] I cut it earlier, when I accidentally broke a plate.
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#7$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"] Go apply some medicine to it. It'll heal sooner that way.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#9$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] I'll be sure to do that, Sir.
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#9$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"] Are these... charbroiled short ribs? I haven't had this dish in a long time.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#9$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] Would you like some? I made them just like you used to love when you were younger. Nothing's changed at all.
As soon as those words left his lips, Matterhorn felt SilverAsh's eyes sweep across him back and forth. He suddenly panics, as if SilverAsh's torch-like gaze had penetrated through to what he had hidden within himself.
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#2$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"] That's alright. I'll just have a bowl of stew.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#2$1")]

[name="Matterhorn"] As long as it suits your tastes, Sir.
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#9$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"] You even prepared some braised beastmeat, which has always been one of Ensia's favorites. No wonder there isn't much left.
[character(name="avg_199_yak_1#10$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"] Lady Ensia... waited for you a long time this afternoon. She has been very uneasy, wondering if you blamed her for what happened back then.
[character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#2$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"] You've always paid particular attention to Ensia. But that's only natural, as she is the youngest of us.

Inside the dining room, SilverAsh falls silent—only the soft sounds of chewing echo thorough the room. Matterhorn feels his throat twitch several times, but cannot produce even a single word.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#9$1", name2="avg_199_yak_1#1$1")]
Finally, SilverAsh sets down his cutlery and dabs the corners of his mouth with a napkin. Though his heart races, Matterhorn still lifts his head to look into SilverAsh's eyes.

[name="Matterhorn"] Sir, you exaggerate. These things cannot be rushed. Do so, and you will spoil its flavor.

[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#10$1", name2="avg_199_yak_1#2$1", focus=1)]
[name="SilverAsh"] True, but care alone is not enough to make the stew. When the time is right, you also have to snuff out the fire.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#10$1", name2="avg_199_yak_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"] That is indeed true, Sir.
