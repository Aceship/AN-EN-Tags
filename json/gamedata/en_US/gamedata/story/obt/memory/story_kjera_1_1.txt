Yet the mountain Kjarr scales now is one of the unnoted—a peak so obscure it was never even named, a height you wouldn't assume anyone dwelt on.
And if anyone else is on this mountain path at this moment, she might frankly be a little surprised.
For a very simple reason. Aside from the peaks Karlan Trade promotes for sightseeing, no mountain's paths could claim to be as smooth as this one's.
—No, even the most tourist-magnet peaks struggle to have paths this pristine.
Yes. Pristine.
The trees are trimmed, the grass seems to grow in its designated place, and there are no loose rocks to be found.
It's practically a garden.
Halfway up, a crisp clanking drifts down from on high. It's fast one moment, slow the next, reverberating through the valley, as if a giant sits in the pass hammering his weapon out.
Kjarr remembers this sound.

He is no giant, and what he beats is no weapon at all.
He's but a lone, wizened hunchback, chipping a hammer and chisel away at a prominent jut of stone.

He remains silent, and simply shuffles to the side, where from his rucksack he pulls a swig of water.
After that, he takes out two lovingly parchment-wrapped grain cakes, and hands one of them over to Kjarr. 
Kjarr hardly refuses. Taking it, she sits down beside him and digs in.
The old man unwraps the other cake, meanwhile, and begins to devour it in great bites.

Watching Kjarr depart, her back turned, the old man is hit with a sudden sense of familiarity.
For an age, he sifts through his mind. And finally, he realizes. Her appearance is akin, in ways, to that of the figure passed down by his ancestor in tradition.
The one who walked and saw a land of deep disaster, who walked and saw despair twined with grief, who walked and saw branches bud in the thawing frost, who walked and saw the warming sun. The one who brought hope to Kjerag.
A streak of bewilderment flashes through the old man's clouded eyes.
