[name="Felipe"]There are no Ægir left in this town.
[name="Felipe"]There used to be some, years ago. I heard that when my parents were young, everyone was treated the same way, whether they were Liberi or Ægir.

[Character(name="avg_NPC_460_1#1$1",name2="char_293_thorns_n_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Felipe"]...Yes, until they arrived.
[name="Felipe"]Many people were taken, mostly Ægir, but also people of other races who were close to them.
[name="Felipe"]The rest of the Ægir left one by one. People say they left of their own accord, but...

Thorns knew a lot about these things.
The fate of the Ægir in this country was sealed the moment Iberia realized the threat from the ocean, when the Inquisition began using force to deal with its tentacles stretching out from the sea.
They had breathing room in some places; in others, they were not so lucky.
This town happened to be one of the 'others.'
[Character(name="avg_NPC_460_1#1$1",name2="char_293_thorns_n_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Thorns"]The fear of suppression has always hung over Iberia. Whether they left of their own accord or were forced to leave doesn't matter in the end.
[name="Thorns"]A worse fate awaited those who stayed than those who went into the barrenlands, or returned to the ocean.

A Liberi and an Ægir stand side-by-side in the crowd.

They were happier times, better times.
