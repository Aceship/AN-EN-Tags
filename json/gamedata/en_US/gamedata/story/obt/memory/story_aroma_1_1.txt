[name="Purestream"]Lots of people onboard Rhodes Island shed hair every day.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_973_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Rubber"]This probably sounds silly, but...
[name="Rubber"]Actually, it's because the drainage pipes under the laundry machines keep getting clogged with hair. Every single one of them.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_446_aroma_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Aroma"]...
[name="Aroma"]I'll ask Engineering and see if there's any way the sewage system can be modified.

[name="Roberta"]I see... That's quite troublesome.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_446_aroma_1#2$1")]
[name="Aroma"]Yeah... It's not a problem we can realistically solve completely, but I still want to figure out if there's any way to reduce the hair we need to clean up.
[name="Aroma"]Which is why I've been observing the operators while I'm working in different areas.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_446_aroma_1#6$1")]
[name="Aroma"]And I realized that some people shed hair just from having it touch their zippers when closing them. And others carefully pull their tails from their pants before carefully grooming them every day.
[name="Aroma"]And it's not just tail hair, there's also head hair, ear hair, hair on the back of your necks... All of this gets on their clothes.
[name="Aroma"]Other than that, there are some who use lint rollers to remove the hair on their clothes before putting them in the laundry machines. If they notice me watching, they even give me an embarrassed smile...
[name="Aroma"]It was only after that that I realized... there's a much more important truth behind this crisis: a lot of operators are worried about their shedding.
[name="Aroma"]Although we've been trying to deal with the hair every day, we've never truly tried to take care of their worries.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_446_aroma_1#2$1")]
[name="Aroma"]I... want to do something for them.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_484_robrta_1#9$1")]
[name="Roberta"]So that's why you want to improve and promote this hydrotherapy machine... But I don't think that's going to be enough. We'll need a lot other ways to go about this, won't we?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_446_aroma_1#7$1")]
[name="Aroma"]Yeah, absolutely.
[name="Aroma"]The cafeteria now has a couple of dishes that help with hair maintenance, and there will be even more choices in the future.
[name="Aroma"]Logistics is also going to introduce new shampoos that are formulated for the hair of different races, too.
[name="Aroma"]And the work I had scheduled for this afternoon was to check on the anti-static equipment in the storage room.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_484_robrta_1#9$1")]
[name="Roberta"]...Okay, Aroma.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_484_robrta_1#10$1")]
[name="Roberta"]I now completely understand just how persistent you can be.
[name="Roberta"]Do you remember what we were discussing earlier?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_446_aroma_1#7$1")]
[name="Aroma"]What...?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_484_robrta_1#9$1")]
[name="Roberta"]When I apply makeup, I always look for the part of the face most worthy of jazzing up first. That's the most important part.
[name="Roberta"]And whether I leave it all to the auto-modelers or grab a makeup brush myself depends on the situation.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_446_aroma_1#2$1")]
[name="Aroma"]...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_484_robrta_1#1$1")]
[name="Roberta"]Huh? What's with that response? Isn't that what you've been doing?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_446_aroma_1#2$1")]
[name="Aroma"]Actually, I'm not really sure about that...
[name="Aroma"]I might have been thinking about it in a much simpler way... I just want to help solve a problem and make everyone's life better.
[name="Aroma"]I think that's what all of us Rhodes Island operators should be doing.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_484_robrta_1#9$1")]
[name="Roberta"]...Well, thanks to you, I just got a new design idea. What do you think about adding a hair dyeing module to the hydrotherapy machine?
[name="Roberta"]You mentioned in your report that there are a lot of people who aren't happy with their hair color...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_484_robrta_1#10$1")]
[name="Roberta"]Anyway, I'm so glad we've got you around in Engineering now. No wonder Weedy's been taking such good care of you.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_446_aroma_1#4$1")]
[name="Aroma"]...That was actually just Procurement.
[name="Aroma"]And it was only because my family's been sending lots of our workshop's shampoos here, so Procurement thought I had some kind of special channel for purchasing them...
