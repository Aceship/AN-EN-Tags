[name="Sora"]  Um, how do I put it... So it's like...

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3", name2="char_101_sora_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]  If we're talking about how Mostima always dragged my sister into working overtime, and how many times that ended with me getting stood up, then yeah, we do have some bad blood.
