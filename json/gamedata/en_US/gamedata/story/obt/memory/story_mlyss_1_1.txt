[name="Muelsyse"]From the voluminous records in the library, to the nameless inscriptions, to experiment records with hardly any headway—yes, I even conducted experiments using samples taken from myself...
[name="Muelsyse"]I spent a long, long time searching for it.
[name="Muelsyse"]And then finally I found it. Where I thought I'd find the answers about my parents, my people, and myself.

[name="Muelsyse"]I <i>have</i> to turn this glass house into the cleanest place in Terra. It <i>must</i> have the freshest air, the most hospitable climate, and the most nutritious soil...

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_249_mlyss_1#2$1")]
[name="Muelsyse"]...Including me.
[name="Muelsyse"]And that's why I need those answers. I have to know why my life is so frail, why I'm so sensitive to Originium Zones.
[name="Muelsyse"]I need to know what I am, what 'Elves' are. I need to know how I was born, if my kin still reside on this land, and where... my future lies.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_966_1#1$1")]

[name="Muelsyse"]There was only a dilapidated mountain village, a patch of dying trees, and a simple and crude cemetery... Time has buried it all.
[name="Muelsyse"]There's no way to even tell if those Elves buried in the Pale Conifers had the answers I've been looking for, or if they were looking for them just as hopelessly as me.

[name="Muelsyse"]You were right, Sunflower.
[name="Muelsyse"]The vivarium's snowy mountains aren't actually mountains, and the icefield isn't an icefield. I'll never be able to recreate a 'Sami,' ever.
[name="Muelsyse"]Because how can I, when I myself don't even know what kind of land I'm looking for?

The rainfall continues.
Rootless waterdrops form a pitter patter curtain of rain in the vivarium.

[name="Square Sunflower"]Stop crying.
[name="Square Sunflower"]It never rains like this in Sami. If you cry any more, you're going to destroy the Polar Area's ecology. And then the other plants will get sick, and you'll worry even more.

[name="Square Sunflower"]You know...
[name="Square Sunflower"]The life cycle of Icefield Cottongrass really isn't long at all. When the winter wind on the icefield is at its strongest, not even a single cotton clump can hold onto its branches.
[name="Square Sunflower"]Two days ago the Polar Area was practically smothered in white cotton wool. For a moment I really thought I was back on the Sami icefield.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_249_mlyss_1#9$1")]
[name="Muelsyse"]...Thank you.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_966_1#1$1")]
[name="Square Sunflower"]It's Cottongrass's fault anyway, for being too curious. She was sending her clumps everywhere while you were away the past few days. They were all over the Polar Area, the Plateau Area, and the Ocean Area. She probably got her wish.
[name="Square Sunflower"]She counted up all the plants in the entire vivarium... there's nearly a thousand species in here, and many of them should already be extinct from various ecological disasters.
[name="Square Sunflower"]You said you wanted to build an ideal habitat here, but what you're actually doing is much more than that... Erm, when I put it that way, you're pretty similar to those other guys.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_966_1#1$1")]

[name="Square Sunflower"]Actually, I realized it from the start. I just wasn't completely sure... All of you can 'feel' us. You're all doing something similar, except you're doing it in a lab while they're in a forest.
[name="Square Sunflower"]Plants are their bandages, while the rain and dew serve as their painkillers... I think they were mending Sami's wounds.

Muelsyse stands in the center of the vivarium, pensively gazing at the plants in front of her.
