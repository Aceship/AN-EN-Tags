[name="Perfumer"]  I'm so very sorry, I was preparing the soil for some plants just now, and didn't notice I had a guest, and for a moment I overreacted...
[name="Perfumer"]  How shameful of me.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1#6",name2="char_236_rope#6",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Uh, no biggie. Don't mind it. I shouldn't have come in without permission.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#6",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Oh, not at all. All my Rhodes Island friends are free to enter as they wish. There's no problem with that.
[name="Perfumer"]  But really, Miss Rope, you could've just called for me if you were here.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Oh, I kinda called my lungs out. You didn't answer...

[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#4",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Hmm... In any case, thank you for your concern~
[name="Perfumer"]  However, there wouldn't be any danger in the Convalescent Garden, you know. After all, this is a place for guests to unwind in. Safety is guaranteed.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  I guess, with all the security systems outside the cabin. No-one from outside Rhodes'd ever get in.

[name="Perfumer"]  Exactly~
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1#2",name2="char_236_rope",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Speaking of which, when did you come in, Miss Rope? It's strange, there ought to be a bell in front of the door.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1#2",name2="char_236_rope",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Bell? Oh, you mean the device thing hidden in the entranceway? I'm guessing if you touch it, it sounds a little ringy thing?
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Right, that's the one. I've always treated it as a visitors' bell.
[name="Perfumer"]  Since there were times I was so busy I wouldn't notice any guests, Closure installed the bell for me. As long as the door sounds that bell, it'll notify me even when I'm working.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  I gotcha.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#4",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Heheh~ You meant that thing, huh. I jumped straight over it.

[name="Perfumer"]  Eh? Jumped...?
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#4",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Uh-huh. Of course I'm not gonna randomly step on stuff if I don't know where it came from! Walk without a sound, climb without a trace. That's essential survival skills.

[name="Perfumer"]  If you're not pressed for time, Rope, could you wait while I finish sorting out these cultivation soils before I get the aromas for you? My hands are all muddy right now; it'd be a little hard.
[name="Perfumer"]  You can stroll about in the greenhouse for now. I'll be all done in just a moment!

[name="Perfumer"]  Any amount of people will have misconceptions when they first come into contact with perfumery and aromatherapy. After all, it's a field you've never learned about. It's very normal you'd think that, Rope.
[name="Perfumer"]  It's something I have to strive hard for—how to give people a true approach to perfumery. The willingness to approach it.

[name="Perfumer"]  If things keep going on like this, I might need to ask Dr. Kal'tsit to see if the greenhouse can't be enlarged a little.

[name="Perfumer"]  Thank you~ But I'm no leisurely unworking rich girl, you know.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  That's, uh, I knew that from the moment I saw you with mud stuck to your face.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Haha, don't tease me now.

[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=1)]
[delay(time=1.1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Here, take it.
[name="Perfumer"]  This one's very popular. A lot of operators use a little just before bed. Makes falling asleep easier.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Ooh~ See, my experience tells me, with packaging this nice and results that good, this probably sells for a ton, right?
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  It won't be expensive at all. These are internal, non-marketed. Only Rhodes Islanders get to use it, for now.
[name="Perfumer"]  Now then, perhaps you'd like to give it a try too, Ropie?
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#7",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Huh? Try what?
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#7",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Aromatherapy, of course. Aromatherapy oils diluted like this are easy to carry, and are sure to alleviate your mind! You can use them anytime, anywhere. It might become a new trend, even!
[name="Perfumer"]  My dear Rope, they fit beautiful young women like you perfectly! Let me recommend you these scents...

[name="Perfumer"]  I'm just giving you some recommendations, nothing more. I'm not going to eat you, now~

[Character(name="char_181_flower_1#3",name2="char_236_rope",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Ah, well.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  What you took with you was a packet of flower seed.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Flower... seeds?
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Quite right. I was planning to prepare some suitable soil for them.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Is this kinda flower seed really expensive?
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Not at all, now.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Then it's really rare?
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  I wouldn't say it's anything unusual.
[name="Perfumer"]  They're common and quite ordinary. But grow them carefully, and they'll be gorgeous when they bloom. Very suited to perfumery, too.
[name="Perfumer"]  You see, no matter what sort of seed, they all return to the soil in the end, and then they'll all flower beautifully.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#2",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  ......
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#2",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Originally, my thought was that when you came to give these seeds back, I'd encourage you to plant them for yourself.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#7",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  You wanted me to? Myself...?
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#7",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  That's right. And then once they grew flowers, maybe I'd make an aromatic for you using them~
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#7",focus=2)]
[name="Rope"]  Eh? For me? Making aroma stuff?
[name="Rope"]  But, uh, why?
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1#3",name2="char_236_rope#7",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  Do you absolutely want a reason? Hmm... let me think.
[Character(name="char_181_flower_1",name2="char_236_rope#7",focus=1)]
[name="Perfumer"]  I think it might be—because I always felt you'd be well suited to aromatics, Ropie.
