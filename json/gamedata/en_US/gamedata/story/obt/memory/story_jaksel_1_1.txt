[name="Jackie"]I was just glad to see the man I rescued, safe and sound.
[name="Jackie"]But you tell me he's a fake, and this is all just a show?

[name="Jackie"]The people I saved... the people who died...
[name="Jackie"]None of that was fake.
[name="Jackie"]Where are the people I rescued? The real ones?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_242",focus="m")]
