As soon as Hibiscus throws open the door, waves of sound wash over her. They must've been bouncing about within the room for a long time before she arrived.
Moreover, it isn't Czerny's music. Even an amateur like her can recognize that these sounds are very juvenile.
It must be his students' performance.
Their notes are interlaced with disorder, adding an extra layer of chaos to an already chaotic room.
