[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]Yes, Instructor.
[name="Hank"]The field commander sent us to the front lines. He treated us like cannon fodder.
[name="Hank"]Thankfully, his men didn't think that way.
[name="Hank"]They saw us as a kind of symbol. They saw in us you.
[name="Hank"]It was like as long as we were there, Sergeant Major Makayla Springthunder was there fighting the battle with them.

[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]We finished our original objectives with the help of the surrounding units, and after getting some rest, they sent us a new mission.
[name="Hank"]To seize the enemy's HQ.
[name="Hank"]The enemy forces weren't in any shape to mount much resistance, so we split into two teams as soon as we reached their HQ.
[name="Hank"]One team stayed outside, to mop up any remaining hostiles and provide support. The other went inside.
[name="Hank"]We never thought the enemy would blow up their HQ to take everyone with them. The guys who went inside didn't make it out alive.

[name="Dur-nar"]......
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]This apparently drove a wedge between the top brass after the war was over, and while they were busy fighting each other, we were reassigned from the front.
[name="Hank"]And a couple months after that, our team was discharged.
[name="Hank"]Just like you.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Dur-nar"]Yeah, I know.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]All of us blamed ourselves. We were lost.
[name="Hank"]We used to think that, as Columbian citizens, it was our duty to answer the president's call to join the military, to protect our homeland, to defend our borders and beliefs. That's what we were meant to do.
[name="Hank"]But actually, all we did in the service was put up with a bunch of arrogant officers.
[name="Hank"]Yelling at our teammates didn't do anything, and taking our anger out on you wasn't going to get us anywhere, but that one month, aside from our training and work, we were stuck in that cycle of negative emotion.
[name="Hank"]After we were discharged, most of us went back to Columbia. It was only once I adjusted back to civilian life that those negative emotions started to fade away.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Dur-nar"]I...
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]I don't know much about strategy, but if it wasn't for you, that war would not have ended so quickly.
[name="Hank"]That victory was Columbia's, but if it wasn't for your decisive assault putting pressure on the commanders, the tug-of-war that came afterwards would've been far worse, and more men would've died on the field.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Dur-nar"]......
[name="Dur-nar"]How come you're so good at comforting people, but you're terrible at making conversation, Hank?

[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Dur-nar"]Oh, don't mind me too much. It's just something I said off the top of my head.
[name="Dur-nar"]Right, weren't you going to take over the family business and rake in the dough? What happened to that? Why are you here at Rhodes Island, serving as an operator?
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]

[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]Yes, Instructor.
[name="Hank"]I talked to my sister about it, and we decided that it was the best to have her take over the family business while I would be her second-in-command.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Dur-nar"]I thought you said you didn't get along with your sister... or at least that's what I think you told me before.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]Yes, Instructor.
[name="Hank"]But after I was discharged, I put some thought into it. Then, for the first time, I had a good discussion with her.
[name="Hank"]She's been smart ever since we were kids. She majored in business too. We figured she would be the better choice to expand the family business.
[name="Hank"]And when my father finally decides to retire and hand the business down to her, I'll leave Rhodes Island and go back home to help out.
[name="Hank"]Right now... I guess I'm here to earn some experience.
[name="Hank"]I wanted to expand my horizons through the lens of Rhodes Island and also make some connections, both inside and outside Columbia.
[name="Hank"]This is very important to my life in the future.

[name="Dur-nar"]And you couldn't have found somewhere more private...?
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]It's easier to get you to talk in this environment.
[name="Hank"]If we talked somewhere else, like the training grounds, you would definitely slip away with some work excuse.
[name="Hank"]And I certainly wouldn't have been able to stop you.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Dur-nar"]Well, you did your homework...
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]All thanks to you.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Dur-nar"]......
[name="Dur-nar"]F-Fine, I'll go into it a little bit.
[name="Dur-nar"]And I'll say this first: I don't remember everything. If I don't have an answer, pushing it isn't going to help.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]Thanks, Instructor.

[name="Dur-nar"]Hah—That time—I think I went home right after they threw me out of the army.
[name="Dur-nar"]I drowned my sorrows at the bars back home, day in and day out, then I'd go outside to make trouble.
[name="Dur-nar"]My family was understanding, at least. Pampered me all the time. They helped me keep from ending up a total failure.
[name="Dur-nar"]After that, my sister pulled some strings, and I got a job working riot police at the local department.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]?
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Dur-nar"]What? These days, lots of little sisters outdo their big sisters, you know?
[name="Dur-nar"]She's much more mature than me. She always took care of everything back home when we were kids, too.
[name="Dur-nar"]It's like I should've been the little sister instead.
[name="Dur-nar"](Takes a sip of the 'Iceflame')
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1")]
[name="Dur-nar"]It's a peaceful little town, so there wasn't much for me to do.
[name="Dur-nar"]After that, the city government decided to reorganize the police force and cut down on the riot police, so I got canned.
[name="Dur-nar"]I guess they figured they could spend the money elsewhere, with how peaceful the place was.
[name="Dur-nar"]So I became a shut-in again and mooched off my parents. I felt bad about it, so I took some of the money I saved up and moved to a nearby nomadic city to look for work.
[name="Dur-nar"]I looked around for a few weeks, and a company wanted me to help manage their security detail. I signed up without thinking too much about it.
[name="Dur-nar"]It wasn't until after I started that I found out their so-called security detail was just a few random bums they picked off the street to guard the place. They didn't have any training, and no equipment either.
[name="Dur-nar"]I wanted to do something about it, but whenever I asked for a budget, the higher-ups would start making up excuses and told me not to worry about it if I knew what's good for me.

[name="Dur-nar"]I had nothing to say to those stupid suits and their fancy business, those jackwads!
[name="Dur-nar"]Well, it so happens that there was a convoy heading out to resupply pioneers hiring bodyguards.
[name="Dur-nar"]So I took a few of the kids who were willing to come with me and joined them as mercenaries.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]Is that why when we first contacted your parents—
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Dur-nar"]You see, out in the frontier, it's not all that uncommon for a letter to take a whole month to not even get delivered.
[name="Dur-nar"]Have you been out there?
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Hank"]No.
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]

[name="Dur-nar"]I never thought I'd get to see places like that in Columbia.
[name="Dur-nar"]The food was terrible, and so was everything we had to use, but everyone held out hope for a good life.
[name="Dur-nar"]But then? Bandits, wild beasts, Catastrophes, you name it. You'll find them out there.
[name="Dur-nar"]Those days were intense.
[name="Dur-nar"]Rusthammers, beasts, gangs.
[name="Dur-nar"]And the goddamned scouts.

[name="Dur-nar"]*Cough*
[name="Dur-nar"]None of the folks I brought with me made it out alive.
[name="Dur-nar"]It was just me, a disgraced old vet, cast out by the explorers, with nowhere to go except back to the city.
[name="Dur-nar"]I went back home to find my old man had kicked the bucket. My little sister took over his work, while her big sister was as much a failure as she'd always been.
[name="Dur-nar"]Heh...
[name="Dur-nar"]Really, when I got the letter, I was wondering if a schlub like me really deserved an invite to this place.
[name="Dur-nar"]And clearly I didn't need to worry about that.
[name="Dur-nar"]Thanks to all of you.
[name="Dur-nar"]And you too, Corporal Mark Green.
[name="Dur-nar"]I'm proud of all of you.
