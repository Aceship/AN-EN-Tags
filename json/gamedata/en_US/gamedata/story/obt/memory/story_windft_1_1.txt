Gantt Jr. presses a few keys, and an elaborate device conducts the resonance of the strings to the feathers and ribbons outside, creating a beautiful arc.

[Character(name="avg_npc_006",name2="avg_433_windft_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Gantt Jr."]I was thinking, maybe I could do something about that production line... the line that Mom and Dad always worked on.
[name="Gantt Jr."]I remember staring at the conveyor belt, lifting up the stuff as it came along, turning it over, and putting it back if it passed inspection. It was inefficient and exhausting.
[name="Gantt Jr."]I want to modify it. Tomorrow.

Gantt Jr. lies down on the bed, aching from a whole day of work.
He stares at the ceiling, where some of the paint has begun to peel off.
He closes his eyes and soon falls asleep.
In his dreams, he has taken over the operations of the factory. Everyone has new uniforms—including those hard hats worn by the workers on the posters—and lives in warm and spacious homes.
He turns over, a smile on his face, and knocks over a jar of medicine by his bedside.
