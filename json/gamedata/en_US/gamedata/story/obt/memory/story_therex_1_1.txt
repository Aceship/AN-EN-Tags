[name="Closure"]  Hmm, hmm... Looks good to me.
[name="Closure"]  Eh? This part here is somewhat strange.
[name="Closure"]  —There's been similar irregularities from two to six in the morning every day? This is the dorm, right?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Engineering Operator"]  That's the dorm. Oh, that reminds me. On the first few days, we got reports of a power outage there.
[name="Engineering Operator"]  We checked it out, and the wiring was all fine. The only thing was that the per unit time output was way over the threshold.

[name="Engineering Operator"]  A little.
[name="Engineering Operator"]  More accurately, it's been kinda cold in here lately... Maybe we should change the AC temperature?

[name="Closure"]  Nah, let's just bear with it. Gotta conserve energy.
[name="Closure"]  Now back on topic, I'm guessing someone's been up to no good and decided to use their unauthorized electronics here.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Oh, right, Boss. You know THRM-EX? I saw him in the hallway each and every time I did my inspections.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  Huh? So it's actually the electronics that's up to no good?

[name="Closure"]  Hm...
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  Oh well, if there's a problem, I'm sure it's just a tiny problem that we don't have to worry about, and if the Doctor's there, I'm sure everything will get sorted out no problem.
[name="Closure"]  And once they're back, I'll talk to Kal'tsit and figure out what's up.

[name="THRM-EX"]  The great Mayer is attending to my body as we speak. With your participation, I can feel that burning hotness in me surging!
[name="THRM-EX"]  Why, hello, Doctor! Would you like me to go over that story of how, through our flawless cooperation at the most treacherous moment, we together defeated the Siracusan hooligans who tried to defile me?
[Character(name="char_376_therex_1", name2="char_242_mayer", focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]  Stop, THRM-EX... I've already listened to your story hundreds of times. Granted, I've barely left the workshop for the past few days.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#5", name2="char_242_mayer", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  You can't keep badass rumors under wraps just because you keep your door shut, Mayer. Just like how everyone knows how badass I am.

[name="THRM-EX"]  Please, my most respected Miss Mayer, a device personally designed by you can't possibly be defective! Look, my overflowing hotness is emanating in all directions from my body!
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_242_mayer#3", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  So what was the reason you launched the second wave earlier?
[name="Closure"]  Let me guess... Maybe the weapon energy output logic is faulty?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_242_mayer#3", focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]  I've already checked before you guys got there. The logic itself is fine.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2", name2="char_242_mayer#3", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  Huh, 'itself?' So you mean there are still issues?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2", name2="char_242_mayer#2", focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]  Mm, I'm not sure if we can really call this a problem. Take a look yourself.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_242_mayer#2", focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]  Efficiency... improvement? It's only by a few percentage points, but the energy that THRM-EX uses when he attacks has clearly been decreasing.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#5", name2="char_242_mayer#2", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  What a surprise! That's a great improvement—Mayer, you're so awesome!
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#5", name2="char_242_mayer", focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]  Stop... not so fast. I didn't implement this change. You know how busy I've been lately, don't you?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2", name2="char_242_mayer", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  Right, when I asked you to look into refactoring the robot arm automation logic, you even told me you couldn't work it into your schedule.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#4", name2="char_376_therex_1", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  Guess I'll just come out and ask, then. THRM-EX, has someone tinkered with you lately?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#4", name2="char_376_therex_1", focus=2)]
[name="THRM-EX"]  A most simple question to answer! Aside from you, the cutest ever Master Closure, and the most intelligent Miss Mayer, I'm of course most intimate with our unbeatable Doctor!
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2")]
[name="Closure"]  Doctor, showing an interest in operating platforms and AI, are we?

[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2", name2="char_376_therex_1", focus=2)]
[name="THRM-EX"]  Don't worry, Master Closure! You can count on me to ensure the Doctor gets to enjoy a hot bedtime.

[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_376_therex_1", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  I see, so that's what you've been up to this month.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_376_therex_1", focus=2)]
[name="THRM-EX"]  Rhodes Island is an epoch-making vessel, yet there is one flaw. The temperature inside the dormitories is not warm enough at night!
[Character(name="char_376_therex_1", name2="char_242_mayer#2", focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]  Yeah, apparently that's the case for some operators. Silence talked to me about it too. Said she sometimes wants to grow some feathers while she's sleeping.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2", name2="char_242_mayer#2", focus=1)]

[name="Closure"]  A—Achoo!
[name="Closure"]  Well, we don't really have a choice. There's more and more people on this ship each day, and there are so many cabins being used at the same time. We need to keep iterating on our energy efficiency, and that ain't an easy job at all.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#6", name2="char_376_therex_1", focus=2)]
[name="THRM-EX"]  I, too, wish to help take that weight off your shoulders, Master Closure. That is why, ever since that night I heard the Doctor sneeze, I made a decision.
[name="THRM-EX"]  I thought I would share the warmth, the hotness in my body with the Doctor and any other operators who struggle with the coldness!

[name="Closure"]  Yeah, I've been listening.
[name="Closure"]  He wants to warm the Doctor up, so he keeps using energy Arts every night, and so he needs to recharge often. Energy usage goes through the roof, overloading the wiring, and my conservation plan goes to waste—

[name="THRM-EX"]  My beautiful Master Closure, thank you very much for your passionate embrace! You are right. It wasn't easy, but I remembered that I am an excellent robot forged with your intelligence!
[name="THRM-EX"]  A little setback—including almost roasting the Doctor alive—is not enough to dampen my spirits. After a period of trial and error, I finally found a way!
[name="THRM-EX"]  And if I may brag for a moment, if I could give the Doctor and the other operators the warmth that they desired, the hard work would most certainly have paid off.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#6", name2="char_376_therex_1", focus=1)]

[name="THRM-EX"]  While I was still paralyzed, I could feel that you were in danger.
[name="THRM-EX"]  My worry for your wellbeing managed to reignite that burning power within my heart, and by the time I regained consciousness, I was already blasting that strike at our enemies!

[Character(name="char_007_closre_1", name2="char_242_mayer#3", focus=1)]
[name="Closure"]  Right, but there's one thing you said that I don't really agree with.
