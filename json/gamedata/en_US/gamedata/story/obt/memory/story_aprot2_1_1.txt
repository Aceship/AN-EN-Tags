The sky is a strange color.
The sun is dark. The clouds are gray. The sky begins to split in the distance, the crack spreading along its center.
But all this is no longer important.
You remember this day.
You can never forget it.
It is like a prophecy destined to come true, one known by everyone.
It is like a nightmare that can never be shaken, always entwining.
You cannot tell if this is just a play.
Perhaps your entire life is just a play, in the eyes of another.
Abyss.
You ask yourself.
The actor on the stage must follow his script. But what about you?
What choice will you make?
