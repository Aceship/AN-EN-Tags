When I was little, the other kids would always make fun of me for being an orphan. A parentless street kid.
I felt terrible. I'd cry and tell my parents on the rare occasions they came home.
Not long after that, for some unknown reason, the kids stopped making fun of me. And they never did again. The big girl next door would gently pat my head, and say to me:
'I'm so sorry about before. Your parents are amazing researchers.'
My Papa and Mama are amazing.
But I rarely get to see them.
On the day I graduated from elementary school, Papa and Mama came back.
We went to the graduation ceremony together. We took pictures together, and went out to all kinds of fun places.
Papa and Mama said they didn't want to miss me growing up. So no matter how tough things were, they'd try to be with me on my most important days.
Papa and Mama said they wanted me to know more about their lives, so they recorded them and passed them down to me so that I'd have more company whenever I missed them.
Does that mean as long as I keep growing up, I'll be able to see Papa and Mama again?
