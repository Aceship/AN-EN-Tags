[name="Angelina"]  Wonderful! That's all the work there is for today!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1")]
[name="Angelina"]  What should I do first? Take a hot bath, maybe enjoy a cup of milk tea first? I still have a bit of that orange cream cake left.

[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Sure... *Yawn*.
[name="Angelina"]  Oh, sorry, Croissant. I couldn't fight that yawn. It's getting pretty late already.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Well, ya see, I ordered a custom hairpin from that one accessory shop down in Lungmen ya pointed out last time.
[name="Croissant"]  Ya don't know the trouble I had to go through just to get the old man there to keep me ten of those trinkets. I guarantee there's something in there you'll like.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#4",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Oh, but...
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#4",name2="char_201_moeshd#4",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  'You'll get bags under yer eyes if ya turn in late,' right? Ya sound like a broken record, 'fcourse I know.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#4",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Alright, I'll keep yer stuff safe. Ya just come to me when you have time. Ya can count on good ol' Croissant to look after her friends!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Yep~ You're the best, Croissant!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Haha, if t'weren't for the fashion magazines ya lent me and all them notes you put in there, no way I could've picked out stuff that good.
[name="Croissant"]  My last few hauls of clothes and accessories've been mighty popular with the folks at Rhodes Island!
[name="Croissant"]  I'm rakin' in a healthy hunk o' dough this month, much thanks to that. Let's get somethin' to eat come a day off next week.
[name="Croissant"]  What'cha like? Barbecue? Pizza? Maybe even them Yen hotpots?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Uh, that's music to my tummy and mouth... but...
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#4",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  But ya gotta 'keep yer weight in check,' right?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#3",name2="char_201_moeshd#4",focus=1)]
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=10, ystrength=12, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Angelina"]  ...I gotta eat healthy.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#3",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Well, true, there's no need to worry about yer weight fer someone like you. Just sayin' so makes me jealous.
[name="Croissant"]  How about we put out a little pamphlet next time? Somethin' like, '101 Weight Loss Tips for Cuties...'
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#2",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Hold on, are you sure that'd sell?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#2",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  A girl can dream, can't she? Might could be there's some folks out there what don't know you, and are gullible enough.
[name="Croissant"]  Like that MountainDash boy who joined us last time. The li'l weightlifting contest you two had? Made me some decent money.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  We were picking on the new kid. Are you sure you should be gloating about it?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Eh, I'm just usin' information to my advantage. Whether it's business or Messenger work, information's king.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Hm... yeah, but it still... kinda bothers me a little. Maybe we'll treat Bison to some cake next time.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Alright, time to head home!

[delay(time=0.4)]
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Huh, what's that by your door?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#2",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Oh... Is that a package? What's a package doing here?
[name="Angelina"]  I already delivered everything I got today.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  It's wrapped in pink, it smells nice, and it feels kinda... square? Probably a book.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Think it's them novels 'n magazines you like to read?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  The magazines show up at a set time every month, and I got everything I ordered this month already. There shouldn't be any more.
[name="Angelina"]  Besides, I've been getting quite a bit of delivery and logistics work lately. My schedule's so full, I haven't had time to read any new novels at all.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  It's a present, then?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#2",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  A present? O-Of course not. Why would anyone give me a present?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#2",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Now that ain't all that wild, is it? Yer such a hottie, put two 'n two together.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#2",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  There's just no way, I'm telling you...
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#4",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  It's not addressed to anyone. I'm guessing it came with something else and was meant to be delivered together.
[name="Angelina"]  I was kinda in a rush this morning, so it probably fell out of my bag by accident.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#3",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  *Sigh*, I screwed up again...
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#3",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Eh, no big deal. You just gotta deliver it again!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Better get to it then.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Huh, now? Tomorrow'd be a-okay, yeah? You just said it's gettin' late.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Someone once told me, 'If you are to correct your mistakes, there is no time better than the present.'

[name="Angelina"]  We've been to a few places already, but we still haven't found who the package is for.
[name="Angelina"]  There aren't any clues or anything on the thing itself, so I guess we're gonna have to keep trying every place I delivered to today.
[name="Angelina"]  Sorry, Croissant. I didn't mean to have you run all over the place with me.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  I tagged along 'cause I wanted to.
[name="Croissant"]  'sides, get in some exercise at night and you wake up all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed the next day.
[name="Croissant"]  You sure you ain't tired? You been runnin' all up and down.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  I'm fine... Well, maybe a little, but it's nothing compared to how worried and disappointed the recipient of the package is.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Well, if that ain't proof that you're one of the finest Messengers there is, I don't know what is.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  R-Really? I always thought I still have a long way to go.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#4",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Eh, reminds me of when I first came to Rhodes Island. This real pretty high school girl came up to me, asking me to teach her how to be a better Messenger. I was real surprised!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  That just tells you how amazing Penguin Logistics is! I mean, it was founded by that Emperor! I'd already heard of you guys when I was still back home!
[name="Angelina"]  I knew right away you must be a great Messenger when I saw you carrying all those packages like it was nothing, so that's why I mustered up the courage to talk to you.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Great Messenger! Haha, I wish you'd told Texas or the Baws that! Could've gotten me a raise or somethin'.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Thinking back, I just felt like I could never do anything right when I first got here... I'm glad you're here, Croissant.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Huh? I ain't done nothin'! Does that time you lost a package 'n started crying, and I handed you some tissues count?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  I wasn't just crying because I lost a package...
[name="Angelina"]  Dr. Kal'tsit said I could choose a combat assignment or go to Logistics, where I would get some long-term field ops like the other Messengers getting treatment on the ship.
[name="Angelina"]  And I chose combat.
[name="Angelina"]  Dr. Kal'tsit agreed with my decision since she thought my abilities could be put to good use on the battlefield after some training.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#3",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  But, deep down in my heart, I was still uncertain about a lot of things.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#3",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  So why'd you decide to start fightin' anyway, Angelina? You don't look like the clobberin' type.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  I... Well, I guess it's probably because I want to be just a little more awesome. 
[name="Angelina"]  I don't want to give anyone trouble, and I don't want to always have to hide behind everyone else.
[name="Angelina"]  I wanted to become an adult who could stand on her own right away. Just like Dr. Kal'tsit and... and... like {@nickname}.
[name="Angelina"]  I guess that probably makes me kinda greedy? I wanted to go to the front lines, but I didn't want to give up my work as a Messenger either.
[name="Angelina"]  I couldn't do anything well back then, and all that training would always leave me exhausted each and every day.
[name="Angelina"]  Then, the next day, I'd find Rhodes Island in a completely different place than the day before. I didn't even know how to get anywhere when I had to make deliveries...
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Is that why you were cryin' your eyes out all a sudden?
[name="Croissant"]  Well yank my tail and call me Sora! I sure am a dummy for missin' that!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#2",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  No, you're not. You were so patient and helped me find my way. You were my hero.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#2",name2="char_201_moeshd#4",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Haha, that's just how you take care of a rookie! We all gotta start somewhere!
[name="Croissant"]  And how can you call yourself greedy? Workin' yer fluff off all 'cause you wanna get better? That's darned normal, if you ask me.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#2",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Take yours truly, I'm giving hustlin' every day just to make myself more money!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Yeah, and I'm always trying to learn from you.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Huh? What do ya mean?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Well, you don't ever get hung up on the things that don't matter...
[name="Angelina"]  Even when you're working on your Rhodes Island missions, you always have a couple dozen packages with completely different delivery routes, and you always have the day's purchases figured out on top of that! You're like a superstar mentor!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Whoowee, I sure didn't know I was that amazin'. All I ever do is try my darndest to git 'er done, 'n beat up all the bad guys what come my way like, bam bam bam!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Just like that! Bam bam!
[name="Angelina"]  When you get to whacking, it's like it blows away all the worries on my mind.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Eh, when you put it like that, it makes a girl blush.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  And ya know, I always thought you were one amazin' girl yerself. That's as a Rhodes Island operator and as a Messenger.
[name="Croissant"]  And I know I ain't nothin' like you.
[name="Croissant"]  The reason I became a Messenger is cause the Baws is sincere and honest and got plenty of money. It so happens I'm good at it, and the gals make it a mighty fun place to be.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#3",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  You ain't like me. Yer passionate about this line o' work, and ya actually care about how the senders 'n recipients feel.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#3",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Actually, that's exactly the reason I became a Messenger.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  No kiddin'?!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#3",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Back when I'd just left home, for the first few days, all I could do was hide in an old neighborhood close by. I didn't go out until nighttime because I was too afraid.
[name="Angelina"]  It was almost winter. The wind was humid and chilly, and I was still wearing the skirt I wore on my last day to school. My whole body had gone all numb.
[name="Angelina"]  I was like an aimless ghost just wandering around.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Then, a Messenger found me, or should I say I found him?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  He was delivering letters right next door.  When they got the letters, the recipients smiled at him, and it felt like that smile was for me too. It kind of... warmed me up a little.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  And that's how you became a Messenger?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  The opportunity was right there, so I took it. I had lots to learn, and it was all very difficult, but it was also very fulfilling.
[name="Angelina"]  After that, I started to believe that your interpersonal relationships are what really make you feel real, alive, existent.
[name="Angelina"]  Ever since I left all the people that knew me, this Angelina has started to fade away bit by bit.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Eh, sounds horrible.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Yeah, looking back, I guess it kind of does.
[name="Angelina"]  After that, I started giving delivery a shot.
[name="Angelina"]  To my surprise, each and every time I hand over a package or a letter to somebody, the smiles on their faces did truly give me something.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#4",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  It's only during these times that... I feel like I've come a little closer to all those emotions I once knew.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  So I kept delivering. I kept experiencing those emotions between people, and I began to slowly find who I once was, who Angelina used to be.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  You ain't the only one who gets those feelings, y'know? Them recipients get all glopped up by yer earnestness just the same. Like that pawpaw just now. You saw how happy he was to see you again?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Too bad. He said the package wasn't his.
[name="Angelina"]  'I got a grandson working out in the cities. He sent me that package of souvenirs—'
[name="Angelina"]  'They're some really sweet tangerines.'
[name="Angelina"]  'That book you got is probably meant for somebody else. I'm old. My eyes aren't what they used to be. Neo wouldn't send me a book.'
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Well, he's right. A good grandson wouldn't send his pawpaw things he couldn't use.
[name="Croissant"]  Gotta say, though... These are some darn sweet tangerines.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Not only did we not do anything, he even shared his souvenirs with us.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#4",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Life's little corners're full o' surprises. Just on this trip, we got us some tangerines, 'n we also almost got beat up. Who'd'a thunk it?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#4",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Well, I didn't expect the same guy who ordered the new 'Moon & Lavender' velvet scarf and pajamas set would turn into some dangerous gangster at night!
[name="Angelina"]  If I'd known, I wouldn't have asked him if he ordered a new 'Moon & Lavender' catalogue outright like an idiot!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  That was so funny, though! Cracked me right up!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  That's right. Everyone could hear you laugh.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Just thinkin' about that scar-faced guy, how he'n and them two other fellers looked! If you said just one more word, they just might'a put us six feet under! Hahahaha...
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  I feel kinda bad, though. Maybe he really didn't want anyone else to know he bought that? That was my mistake. Thank goodness you were there to smooth things over.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  'Much appreciated, Baws. We hope you and the lady will be satisfied with yer purchase today. Next time, how 'bout a catalogue too~?'
[name="Croissant"]  Sounds just like a salesperson, no?
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Yeah, very professional.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]  Great! Gotta get it memorized, then! The next time I go on deliveries, maybe I should take this on as a side job! Can't get enough side jobs!
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  He's probably really fond of that item, though... I can't imagine him spending this much on insurance otherwise. I sure hope he'll be able to share his hobbies with everyone someday, openly.
[name="Angelina"]  This might just be the significance we Messengers have. It keeps him that much more at ease when it's a stranger that delivers his items.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#4",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  But I betrayed his trust this time.
[Character(name="char_291_aglina_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Angelina"]  Looks like I gotta work even harder.
