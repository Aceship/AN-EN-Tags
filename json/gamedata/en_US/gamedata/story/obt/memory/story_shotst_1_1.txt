[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=1)]
[name="Meteor"]  Sure thing. Hm, where were we again?
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=2)]
[name="Gianna"]  The beast found her, and it was going to catch her.
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=1)]
[name="Meteor"]  Oh, right. The little hunter was so scared that she was hiding in a pile of leaves. She could already hear the beast's breath and the sounds of its hooves trudging through the mud.
[name="Meteor"]  Huff—Huff—
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=2)]

[name="Meteor"]  The little hunter was too scared to even breathe. Tears dripped down her face one after another.
[name="Meteor"]  The beast had been hunting the hunter day after day, night after night. She managed to get away so many times, but our poor little hunter wasn't going to get away this time.
[name="Gianna"]  Don't give up, hunter!
[name="Meteor"]  Right, she can't give up! As soon as the beast bore its fangs, the hunter forced herself to calm down and asked, 'Do I really have my back to the wall?'
[name="Meteor"]  She held her breath and took out the very last arrow in her quiver. She finally found the courage to take on the beast, looking straight at it through the gaps in the pile of leaves.
[name="Gianna"]  Why wasn't she scared anymore?
[name="Meteor"]  She remembered a song that her grandpa used to sing for her.
[name="Gianna"]  What kind of a song is that? Can you sing it for me, Meteor?
[name="Meteor"]  When the little hunter was still a tiny little baby hunter, her grandpa always sang this while he held her: '♪My baby girl, should you find yourself chased through the woods by a beast most vile, under the calm, gentle moon in the sky♪'
[name="Meteor"]  '♪Never forget, walk forth in big strides. If there is no way to go, turn around not with fright. With your bow and arrow you must fight, and the beast you must smite♪'
[name="Meteor"]  At that moment, the moonlight lit the way, and the earth helped her lift her shoulders. The little hunter released her bowstring, and the roaring breeze sent her arrow straight into the beast's chest, felling it.

[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=1)]
[MusicVolume(volume=0.4,fadetime=1)]
[name="Meteor"]  Yes, it did. With that tiny bit of determination and courage, the little hunter defeated the frightening beast in the most decisive moment. And me, that's also how I overcame my past, the past that I used to be scared of.
[name="Meteor"]  And as long as you can muster up the courage, Gianna, you can overcome anything that—

[name="Gianna"]  But, Meteor, I-I don't want to defeat my past! When I'm scared, it's not just the bad things that I remember. I remember all the happy memories I had with everyone too!
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=1)]
[name="Meteor"]  Doesn't thinking about them make your heart ache, though?
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=2)]
[name="Gianna"]  Yup... it does, and it makes me cry, but it warms up my heart too. When I didn't have you, it was the memories that helped me through everything.
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=1)]
[name="Meteor"]  Hmm... really? Looks like... Looks like your little beast doesn't actually want to eat you. Haha.
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=2)]
[name="Gianna"]  I don't think the beast in your story wanted to eat the hunter either.
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=1)]
[name="Meteor"]  Hm? What makes you think that?
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=2)]
[name="Gianna"]  How does the hunter know the beast wants to eat her? She didn't ask the beast, and she's only ever run away. She never tried to talk to the beast.
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=1)]
[name="Meteor"]  Well, the beast has been chasing the hunter. What else could it be after, if not eating her?
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=2)]
[name="Gianna"]  No, Meteor. You said the hunter was scared, cold, and hungry. You never said she was hurt because the beast chased her.
[name="Gianna"]  Maybe it thinks the lonely girl needs a friend to help her out of that place.
[name="Gianna"]  Please, Meteor. Please don't kill it.

[name="Gianna"]  Did I say something wrong?
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=1)]
[name="Meteor"]  No, you reminded me of something, in the past.
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=2)]
[name="Gianna"]  Is it a memory that makes your chest burn?
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=1)]
[name="Meteor"]  Yep, it always makes me feel down in the dumps whenever I think about it. That's why I try my best to keep myself from remembering it.
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=2)]
[name="Gianna"]  You can't do that, Meteor.
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1")]
[name="Meteor"]  Yeah, you're right. The hunter was wrong, and I was too. I shouldn't have killed it, and I shouldn't have sealed the memory away.
[name="Meteor"]  All those nights I spent in the wastes, away from my family. The pain, the joy, the sorrow, and the boredom... It was there every moment, and it wasn't there to kill me.
[Character(name="avg_126_shotst_1", name2="avg_npc_045", focus=2)]

[name="Meteor"]  At the very end, the little hunter took her dagger out, but she didn't use it to stab the beast's heart.
[name="Meteor"]  Instead, she cut off a piece of her clothes and bandaged the beast's wound.
[name="Meteor"]  She petted the beast's fluffy head and then asked, 'Can you move, buddy?'
[name="Meteor"]  The beast pondered a little in silence and then stood up.
[name="Meteor"]  Then, she asked the beast, 'I'm going on an adventure. I don't know what lies ahead, but I know I'll need a buddy. Do you want to come?'
[name="Meteor"]  The beast didn't stay quiet this time. It neighed happily, and it started to sway its tail from side to side, like a whip.
[name="Meteor"]  It ran really fast, and when she rode on its back, it was just like the hunter could grasp the wind.
[name="Meteor"]  She wasn't lonely any more. Together, they ran off toward the sunlight.
