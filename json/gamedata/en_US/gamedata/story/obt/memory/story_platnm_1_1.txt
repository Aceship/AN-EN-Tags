Platinum looks into the distance. There are three Darksteel arrows bound together as one, blazing through the sky as they let out a sharp howl.

The moment the water touches the phone, an intense tirade can be heard blaring out of its receiver, but as soon as the glass has been emptied of the sparkling water, there is a brief buzz, and the phone falls silent once again.

[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#1")]
[name="Malkiewicz"] Nothing will happen.
[Character(name="char_204_platnm_1#1")]
[name="Platinum"] Oh, this suuucks. How come I'm getting you and the Doctor mixed up in my dream?

I can be someone you are afraid of.

I can be someone you pity.

I can be someone who you show an interest in.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106",fadetime=0.7)]
[name="Czarny"] Together, we form that place you can never leave behind—the very place you dread—the tower.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106")]
[name="Czarny"] You grew up there. It was your future. You ran from it, and you still feel as though you have nowhere to go. You are confused and helpless.

Without a single word, Platinum gazes at the dreamscape.

Right as he makes his proclamation, the ceiling starts to open outward, revealing the uppermost level of the General Chamber building.
There are no seats or telephones there.
Only branches extending endlessly into the night sky like those of a tree. At the rate they are growing, the branches will one day engulf even the sun and moon.
Each branch is fabricated from different materials.
Steel, newspapers, wood, and grain.
The different materials all merge into one.
Of the different branches, there is a particular one full of thorns and arrowheads that lets out a sharp roar as it blazes past the winds.
Platinum feels as though she is standing on the head of a giant beast, its wings spread toward the skies, its roots dug deep into the earth.
Its skeleton is welded together from different materials, and all kinds of currency flow within its veins.
As for Platinum herself, she was once an insignificant cell of this beast.
But what about now?
[Character(name="char_204_platnm_1#1")]
[name="Platinum"] You might be right, Kazimierz.
[Character(name="char_204_platnm_1#1")]
[name="Platinum"] But––
[Character(name="char_204_platnm_1#6")]
[name="Platinum"] —I refuse.
