[name="Zima"]...
[name="Zima"]Anna, you absolutely didn't need to come.
[name="Zima"]The USSG's already disbanded.
[name="Istina"]Yes, by your personal statement. Being the initial proponent of the Group's establishment, shouldn't you solicit my view?
[name="Istina"]Not to mention those of Lada, Rosalind, and Natalya.
[name="Zima"]Okay, so what are your views?
[name="Istina"]We all object.
[name="Zima"]...
[name="Istina"]I can more or less guess what your thinking ultimately was.
[name="Istina"]To be honest, I've been deliberating over the USSG's continuation myself...
[name="Istina"]If we never encountered Rhodes Island, our lives might now be much the same as Daniil's.
[name="Istina"]But you see, Sonya... even for all Rhodes Island gives us, it doesn't mean we must lose anything.
[name="Zima"]We're not even in the same squad anymore.
[name="Istina"]Come, help me out.
[name="Istina"]This bundle's quite the heavy load.
[name="Zima"]...
[name="Zima"]I'll carry this side. We need to hurry up.

[name="Zima"]What is it?
[name="Istina"]We may not be in the same squad anymore, true, and I estimate we'll only be further split up in future, but...
[name="Istina"]At the very least, when you think to bear something alone, we'll come to your side like we are now...
[name="Istina"]Because we are eternal comrades.
