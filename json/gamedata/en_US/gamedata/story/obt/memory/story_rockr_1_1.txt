Another morning comes to the aging light industry district.
The effect of the Sarkaz work ban can be seen in the crowds of workers headed towards the factories in the dim light of dawn.
The Sarkaz sent people to keep an eye on them at first.
But they soon realized that they were like the walking dead, completely silent on their way to work. They never cross the line, even if no one is watching.
The Sarkaz have stopped sending people to monitor the workers, freeing up the manpower to deal with resistance to their rule in other districts.
Poverty and hunger make the best overseers.
