[Character(name="avg_npc_177", name2="avgnew_275_breeze_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Butler"]From the manor library. You remember them, don't you? The baron's translation, which you've flipped through so many times.
[name="Butler"]There will always be little details that slip your mind, of course. Bring them along for reference.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177", name2="avgnew_275_breeze_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Grace"]Counsell...
[Character(name="avg_npc_177", name2="avgnew_275_breeze_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Butler"]I've seen this play before. I can't stop you.
[name="Butler"]I'll tell them I couldn't catch you. Just don't let it slip that I let you go on purpose.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177", name2="avgnew_275_breeze_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Grace"]...Thank you.

[Character(name="avgnew_275_breeze_1#2$1")]
[name="Grace"]You're not going back on your words, are you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Butler"]I visited Dr. Siew to retrieve the trinket you 'forgot' on his door.
[name="Butler"]He told me that if I ever saw the young lady's Vulpo 'friend,' I should tell her that he most definitely did not forget to close the clinic's window, and certainly did not leave various medicines and supplies on the table.
[Character(name="avgnew_275_breeze_1#4$1")]
[name="Grace"]I see...
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Butler"]There will be no hiding your little sojourn. Have you thought about what you'll do when your father returns? I doubt arguing will help the matter.
[Character(name="avgnew_275_breeze_1#1$1")]
[name="Grace"]I'll apologize. I'm not ready to argue with him yet.
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Butler"]Be careful, and keep your identity a secret.
[Character(name="avgnew_275_breeze_1#6$1")]
[name="Grace"]Thank you, Counsell.

Counsell gazes to the west and sees the light of the setting sun fall on the floor of the Arizona Manor.
