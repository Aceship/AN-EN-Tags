[name="Patrizion"]You could've taken on so much more responsibility.
[name="Patrizion"]Now, even if I don't make it sound so scary, it's actually pretty fun to be a Gun-Knight! You're not a Sankta, and you don't have this annoying halo over your head. The helmets wouldn't give you a headache.
[name="Patrizion"]You can't wield a gun, but we can get you a huge-ass grenade launcher just as easily.

[Character(name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#1$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]At first, it might actually have been guilt that drove me to follow her around. I felt I was partly responsible for her becoming fallen. I was worried she would be so depressed that she'd truly fall.

[Character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#5$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1")]
[name="Patrizion"]And you finally found him at the Summit of Nations two days ago.
[Character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#6$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]It wasn't enough. He got away. If I see him again, I will take him in myself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1")]
[name="Patrizion"]Then you truly have no reason to keep following Mostima around. You could become an executor. That way, you can travel across the land on this case.
[Character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#9$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]No, that's not what I meant.
[name="Fiammetta"]After I got back this time, I suddenly realized Mostima and I have been so many places and met so many people. Set aside all objectives and purposes, and that in itself is my choice.
[Character(name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#1$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]Right, but if you've never been away from home, how would you know what it means to come home? There are lots of places that stir my heart more than Laterano, but there will only ever be one Laterano.
[name="Fiammetta"]Besides, this journey actually isn't all that bad.
[Character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#4$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]It's true. I don't enjoy my life.
[name="Fiammetta"]I'm just going through it.

[name="Patrizion"]I'd even be okay with it if you wanted to go nuts and become a cardinal like Lemuen. I could talk to His Holiness about it.
[name="Patrizion"]It's a lot more work than being an Apostolic Knight, but it's much better than having to bustle around outside.
[name="Patrizion"]Or I could simply order you to stay.

[name="Fiammetta"]You won't. You're you, after all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1")]

[name="Patrizion"]My friends are dying, one by one. My students are scattered all across the world. The clerics simply respect me; they rarely come talk to me.
[name="Patrizion"]It's boring, Fia. It's very boring. All I can do these days is chew over what's left of those days gone by, until nothing is left but some fuzzy feelings, to the point that I forget what I was trying to remember in the first place.

[name="Fiammetta"]I'll pass. I watched more than enough of those back when I was a kid. I even entered one.
