[name="Operator Chard"] By the way, Vanilla, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
[name="Operator Chard"] What do you usually feed Kuro?
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=1)]
[name="Vanilla"] Kuro's not a picky eater. He's usually happy to eat whatever veggies or meat I give him.
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=2)]
[name="Operator Chard"] If you keep feeding them, do they grow up?
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#5", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=1)]
[name="Vanilla"] Of course. When I first got Kuro, he was only as big as my palm, and now he's—Hm, why don't you come take a look yourself, Chard? He's really cute!
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#5", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=2)]
[name="Operator Chard"] I heard that when Provence and Skyfire were out on a mission in Siesta, they came across a huge Originium slug—as big as a small mountain.
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#5", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=2)]
[name="Operator Chard"] Apparently it ate some kind of rock called... obsidian to grow that big.
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=1)]
[name="Vanilla"] It's true that Originium slugs' body sizes can vary greatly depending on the environment they live in, but a small mountain?
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=2)]
[name="Operator Chard"] If you fed Kuro some obsidian, maybe he'll grow that big too? It'd be really cool to take to the battlefield riding on him, don't you think?
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#6", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#2", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"] Some of the wounded have been transferred to Rhodes Island from a nearby hospital. They are all from the same village, and all of them were injured in an Originium slug attack.
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#2", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]Aside from patching the wounded up, the villagers also wanted us to take care of the Originium slug problem for them.
[name="Dobermann"] The hospital was worried that they'd be infected and sent them here. Thankfully, they're only hurt. None of them are infected.
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#2", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Vanilla"] But... unless they are under the control of Casters, wild Originium slugs don't normally attack humans, much less charge into human settlements.

[name="Operator Chard"] You mean... this whole plantation was destroyed by Originium slugs?
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=1)]
[name="Village Headman"] It was about a month ago. One night, the villagers heard someone call for help from the plantation.
[name="Village Headman"] Everyone hurried over, only to find the nighttime guard lying on the ground, badly injured and on his last legs. The plantation was just as you see it now.
[name="Village Headman"] It took three whole days for him to come to.
[name="Village Headman"] From what he told us, that night, he heard noises out in the fields. He thought it was thieves and went closer to check it out, only to find about a dozen Originium slugs.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=2)]
[name="Operator Chard"] Hold on. Did he really make out how many slugs there were in such a dense forest at night?
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=1)]
[name="Village Headman"] According to him, the smallest of them was as tall as a person, while the largest was about the size of a small house.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=2)]
[name="Operator Chard"] Phew... Now that's really straight out of a monster movie.
[name="Operator Chard"] Is it possible that his eyes were playing tricks on him, and they were some other kind of wild beast?
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1")]
[name="Vanilla"] It's true that these bites are far bigger than what you'd expect from an Originium slug.
[Character(name="avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Chard"] Vanilla... Have you seen slugs this big?
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1")]
[name="Vanilla"] (Shakes head)
[Character(name="avg_npc_005")]
[name="Village Headman"]Right, no one believed him at first. A few of our young'uns then formed a search team and went to the hills behind the village to investigate.
[name="Village Headman"]We looked all over, and we finally got a clear view of it. It was really a giant Originium slug... The search team got ambushed too, and quite a few of them got seriously hurt.
[name="Village Headman"]We stopped going outside the village after that, but the slugs kept coming nonetheless. The villagers often find themselves attacked, too.
[name="Village Headman"]We tried asking the cities for help, but none of the nobles cared about a little village like ours. It wasn't until we took our wounded to Rhodes Island that we found out about this company.
[name="Village Headman"]*Sigh*... Thanks for your help.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", focus=2)]
[name="Vanilla"]Don't worry, sir, we'll do all we can to solve this problem.
[name="Vanilla"]If I may ask, did the village have any run-ins with Originium slugs before this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", focus=1)]
[name="Village Headman"]Well, they'd pay us a visit once in a while, but usually it's just a couple of them chewing on the hops in the fields, and they'd run the moment they spotted us.
[name="Village Headman"]We never saw any slugs that big, much less ones that would attack humans.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", focus=2)]
[name="Vanilla"]So there's always been Originium slugs in this area, then...
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", focus=1)]
[name="Village Headman"]The woods outside the village are pretty uneven terrain. Not even I know exactly what's going on in there.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", focus=2)]
[name="Vanilla"]Aside from that, have you noticed anything out of the ordinary in the village lately?
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", focus=1)]
[name="Village Headman"]What do you mean?
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", focus=2)]
[name="Vanilla"]Like, have there been any strange visitors? Or a sudden change in climate? Please try to remember. All of this is very important.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", focus=1)]
[name="Village Headman"]If I have to say, the only brewery in the village went out of business three months ago. Some of the men were attacked by the slugs when they were delivering hops to other towns.

[name="Operator Chard"] Any ideas?

[name="Operator Chard"]Hey, dude, chill out a little. Think about it. These Originium slugs are tiny. How are they supposed to bite anyone? It'd take years for them to chew up a huge plantation like that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_089")]
[name="Operator Chard"]Besides, didn't your search team find mutant Originium slugs outside the village? There's no reason to slaughter your neighbor's pets.
[Character(name="avg_npc_002")]
[name="Angry Villager"] *Spit*—Say whatever you want, but I never saw any of those giant slugs they kept talking about, and all the people on the search team are in the hospital right now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_002")]
[name="Angry Villager"] Who knows if these Oripathy-infested bugs knew some weird kind of Arts? If he's keeping these filthy things in his house, he's got to be up to no good!
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#6")]
[name="Vanilla"] Originium slugs can't get Oripathy!
[Character(name="avg_npc_002")]
[name="Angry Villager"] —?
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1")]
[name="Vanilla"] We only call them Originium slugs because their outer shells contain Originium. They don't have any crystals inside their bodies.
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1")]
[name="Vanilla"] They've been studied by many, many biologists out there, and even though no one knows why, no one has ever found an Originium slug that's been infected with Oripathy naturally.
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1")]
[name="Vanilla"] And it's nearly impossible to come down with Oripathy from an Originium slug bite.

[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_005")]
[name="Village Headman"] Yes, of course, but I'm afraid you might find the woods and hills outside a little difficult to traverse with just the two of you.

[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=1)]
[name="Vanilla"] Normally, when a swarm of wild slugs suddenly becomes aggressive, the most likely reason is that their habitat has gone through a sudden, drastic change.

[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1", name2="avg_npc_089", focus=1)]
[name="Vanilla"] But to figure out what exactly happened here, we have to first find where the Originium slugs lived in the forest.

[name="Vanilla"]Yep... Incubator, food, water... Everything's the same as Kuro.
[name="Vanilla"]This is your new home. Welcome home!
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1")]
[name="Franka"] Whoa, another one? Not bad, Vanilla. You find yourself a new pet every time you go out on a field mission... Did Dr. Kal'tsit really give you permission to keep so many pets?
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1")]
[name="Vanilla"]Of course. Just like Kuro and Tiny, he's registered.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1")]
[name="Franka"] This place is starting to feel like an Originium slug museum... What's the new guy called?
[Character(name="char_240_Vanilla_1#1")]
[name="Vanilla"]He looks a tad bit rounder than Kuro. Okay, you'll be Puffball! Kuro, Tiny, be sure to get along with Puffball. Don't pick on him!
