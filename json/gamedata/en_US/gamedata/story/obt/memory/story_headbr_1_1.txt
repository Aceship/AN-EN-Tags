[name="Zima"]Alright, here we go. Pay attention. This is a barbell, this rack over here's called a 'Smith machine.' You fix the barbell inside these rails here. Why do you think we do that?

[name="Infected Girl"]So you can't take the barbell away?
[character(name="avg_115_headbr_1#1$1")]

[name="Zima"]This way, you can do squats... just hold it like this, then make sure your knees don't go over your feet, breathe out and crouch, breathe in and lift.
[name="Zima"]You can lie down here too, do presses, and buff up your arm strength. But you gotta watch out when you're training. Make your barbell too heavy and you can't lift it, and then if it crushes you, you're, uh. (Crosses throat and croaks)

[name="Zima"]I mean, yeah, it will if it's too heavy, so, real dangerous. Gotta watch out for that when you train.
[name="Zima"]Then this thing's a pull-up machine, horizontal and parallel bars. Back to the brace, both hands firm on the handles, then rest your arms on the beams, lift your body into the air, and do crunches like this. Works out your abs.
