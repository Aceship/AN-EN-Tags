Bornu the soldier's hidden comics were all piled in the middle of the barracks.
The person who drew the comics in the book very carefully drew their covers, titles, and issue numbers. The strokes are all very heavy, so much that the pages are almost torn.
The people around him are crudely drawn in only a few strokes, to the point that they seem almost unreal.

After that, the entire brigade was sent to the front lines.
Most believed the reason behind this decision was Bornu angering his father, and this made his situation all the worse.
In the end, Bornu chose to desert.
He was caught by the patrolmen before he could even leave the encampment. But, coincidentally, an enemy attack came at the exact same time.
The enemy's onslaught was swift and brutal. Before long, the already demoralized brigade was defeated.

Spot picks up a dinner roll and takes a bite.

Spot pauses for a moment to take a sip of juice, almost like it's intentional.
He's worried he might choke, but his mind is too occupied.
He once assumed he would keep this secret forever.

[name="Orchid"]Spot, you don't have to talk about yourself like that.
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1")]
[name="Spot"]Whatever.

[name="Orchid"]Yeah... pretty much.
[Dialog]
[character]
[Delay(time=1.5)]
A moment of silence passes.
Moments of silence like this are rare for Team A6.
Spots takes a look around.
Popukar seems a bit dejected; Midnight appears frivolous as ever; Orchid looks a bit tense, stirring her coffee repeatedly with a spoon; and Catapult sits restlessly as ever.
The one and only thing that's common to all of them is that they genuinely care about him.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]So... you drew the comic Popukar was talking about?
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1")]
[name="Spot"]Yeah.
[name="Spot"]That brigade was stupid. I listened to my old man and went out there to suffer. I had just about as much water in my brain as Midnight does now.
[name="Spot"]The officers never saw footsoldiers as human. Every month, someone would collapse from overtraining, and in the end, we'd be shedding our blood in the pointless squabbles of the lords ameer.
[name="Spot"]The hot climate was probably the only good thing about those years. The heat dried up all the water in my brain, and finally gave me a clear enough head to realize I should just desert.
[multiline(name="Spot")]But...
[multiline(name="Spot",end=true)]What if I didn't?
[name="Spot"]For a long time, I couldn't shake the thought. And that's what gave birth to the self-glorifying doodle Popukar found.
[name="Spot"]I drew it, even fantasizing like an idiot that if I didn't desert, my old man would've come around to see me in a new light.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1")]
[name="Midnight"]Spot, let me go right to the point here. As well as I know you, I can say this: that's impossible.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]Midnight!
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1")]
[name="Spot"]It's fine. Let him talk.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4")]
[name="Midnight"]Many moons ago, when I still dominated my line of work as the Devil of the Eastern Night, I once had an industrious coworker. He was known far and wide for his incisive way with words.
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1")]
[name="Spot"]We've barely gotten started, and I've already got a bad feeling about this.
[name="Spot"]If you're gonna tell me your buddy joined the Higashinese military for some reason and couldn't fit in, well, I'm gonna be disappointed.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3")]
[name="Midnight"](Laughs)
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1")]
[name="Spot"]*sigh*.
[name="Spot"]I can see right through your phony stories, but at least your heart's in the right place.
[name="Spot"]If you end up being some great hero, I'll probably lose faith in the collective sanity of mankind.
[name="Spot"]But if everybody comes to see <i>me</i> as a hero, I think I'll probably assume the species is just stupid.
[name="Spot"]At the end of the day, my family raised me on an ideal that I just can't fit.
[name="Spot"]That's why the comic ends with me getting a medal. It's the best my lousy imagination can conjure up anyway.
[name="Spot"]Even if I kept it going, once Bornu became a hero, I wouldn't know how to keep his heroics up. I can't plan it out, especially when it's an idea born out of a contradiction to begin with.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1")]
[name="Popukar"]I think... I don't get it anymore... kinda...
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#6")]
[name="Orchid"]It's okay. It'll make sense after you grow up.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1")]
[name="Popukar"]But did I do something bad? Is that why you had to talk about stuff you don't want to talk about?
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1")]
[name="Spot"]No way.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1#5")]
[name="Popukar"]Huh?
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1")]
[name="Spot"]Actually, it's all thanks to you, Popukar...

[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#2")]
[name="Midnight"]He's certainly not sick.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1#7")]
[name="Popukar"]But Spot looks like he's not feeling well...
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1")]
[name="Midnight"]Words he hasn't spoken in his entire life are brewing in his mind right now. They're words so corny—
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]—Are you sure about that, Midnight?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#2")]
[name="Midnight"]—No, words of admiration. They are embarrassing to say to someone for the first time, you see.
[name="Midnight"]Even I, cunning though I am, found myself terribly flustered when I hosted my first customer.

Spot doesn't answer him.
