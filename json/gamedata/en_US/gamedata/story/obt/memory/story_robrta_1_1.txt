[name="Roberta"]I just remembered a conversation we had. She said she was going to do what she liked.
[name="Roberta"]It was a cloudy day. The guy who owned the restaurant was so stingy that he didn't want to turn on a few more lights. It was completely dark, so I shouldn't have been able to see her face all that clearly...
[name="Roberta"]But I still vividly remember her smile.
[Dialog]
[Character]
The face before her, white as a sheet of paper, overlaps with the face full of resolve and hope in Roberta's memories. She picks up her brush and starts painting the lifeless face.
As her brush applies the makeup foundation stroke after stroke, the face starts to become more vibrant, its dried out cheeks looking plump once more.

[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Roberta"]You think so?
[name="Roberta"]I've known her since I started in this industry.
[name="Roberta"]Back then, I didn't have a penny to my name, and I couldn't find a place to stay. She took me into her little basement.
[name="Roberta"]After that, the two of us hopped from production to production, looking for work that could earn us a living.
[name="Roberta"]She was a first-class makeup artist. She could turn a face into something totally different.
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Morgue Worker"]From the sound of it, she could've made a lot of money in Wrankwood.
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Roberta"]You need more than talent to make it big in Wrankwood. Her luck was rotten to begin with, but she was stubborn, too. She skipped every opportunity that came her way.
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Roberta"]Seven years. We knew each other seven years. I remember how much energy she had when she got here, how she slaved away at night working on her projects, how excited she was when she got her first credit, and now...
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Roberta"]Now she's lying here in the morgue.

[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=2)]

[name="Roberta"]What do you think...? If really did it right...
[name="Roberta"]Then why isn't she opening her eyes? Why isn't her heart beating? Why are her lips shut tight...?
[name="Roberta"]Why is she just lying there... in silence?
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Morgue Worker"]Well... because she's dead.

[Dialog]
[Character]
A sense of perplexity spreads from Roberta's face. At a loss, she simply looks at the tall, lifeless body.
With her guard down, the pain in her heart takes its chance to strike. The sharp sensation spreads out to every corner of her body.
At last, she finds herself unable to stand. She squats down into a ball, buries her face into her knees, and cries uncontrollably.
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Roberta"]If I was... just a little determined, just a little stubborn, would things have turned out different for her?

[name="Morgue Worker"]What makes you say that?
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Roberta"]In Wrankwood, two things top the big studios' wishlists. First and foremost, they want people who follow orders. Next, they want technique. Your dreams and interests don't matter.
[name="Roberta"]I know that better than anybody, but I gave up on pushing her. I couldn't do it.
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Roberta"]Because... there was a voice in my heart that told me she was right.
[name="Roberta"]But I decided to ignore it. I couldn't keep going, like she did.
[name="Roberta"]I made it all the way to today. I bowed my head to put food on the table.
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Roberta"]I gave up and sacrificed a lot to stay commercial. And so my work became more and more successful.
[name="Roberta"]At the same time, my stuff got less interesting. I'm sure, one day, I'll be completely sick of it.
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Roberta"]But the excitement and joy she had never died down from the day she started in the business.
[name="Roberta"]I think... with nothing else, that could've pushed her to make a name for herself.
[Character(name="avg_484_robrta_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_523_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Roberta"]I've always held out hope that her luck would turn around, that she'd be the exception to prove the rule. I really hoped for her... but I was wrong.
