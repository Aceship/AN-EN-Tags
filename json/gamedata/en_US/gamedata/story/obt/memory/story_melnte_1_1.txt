As she opens her eyes, she feels the familiar sensation of the dream filling her chest for a fleeting moment.
If she takes a moment to savor it, the soft yet heavy feeling seems almost poignant.
It is not the bloody pain of having your arm cut off.
It is the sorrow of remembering, long after the injury has healed, that you once used your hands to cover a friend's eyes one afternoon, long ago.
Now, however, Melanite does not have the luxury of analyzing the subtle and difficult-to-describe emotions.
All she knows is that her dreams have disrupted every aspect of her life, made her anxious, given others cause for concern and made them give her special treatment... Left unchecked, they would eventually make her a worthless invalid.
Rhodes Island may be kind, but how long would they tolerate an invalid?

Melanite takes the cup with a blank look on her face, feeling the warmth in her hands and trying to pinpoint the deep sorrow that the sweet scent has stirred within her heart.
The memories float to the surface, but years of evasion have made their surface cold and smooth.
She tries to reach towards the source of the sorrow that seems so incongruous with the sweetness, yet it lingers just out of reach.
She takes a sip of the light brown liquid in the cup.
As her tongue senses the sweetness, those memories dissolve in water, with the sweet scent of chocolate and cystymilk emanating from the surface.
In the reflection, she sees herself holding a warm drink in her hand.
In the cup, she finds the time that she lost, and is found in turn by the time she once thought discarded.
She hears an unfamiliar yet familiar voice from the cup.
