[name="Ensia"]  So Uncle Tarja's condition got worse, the tearstone that was supposed to last over half a year was used up by autumn, and no one on either side of the mountain can lend him any more?

[character(name="avg_198_blackd_1#6$1", name2="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="Weiss"]  According to legend, tearstone can only be mined one palmful at a time, for that is the size of one of Kjeragandr's teardrops.
[name="Weiss"]  If any more are extracted at once, then they lose their effectiveness.
[name="Weiss"]  In fact, you were the one who retrieved the one Mister Tarja was using. That was two years ago though, so you might not remember it.

Ensia turns her head and takes a look at the ashen-gray sky.
For now, the clouds aren't too dense, and not even a single sign of wind can be seen through the window.

[name="Ensia"]  Weiss's intuition is as sharp as ever.
[name="Ensia"]  If it weren't for Uncle Tarja's emergency situation, he definitely wouldn't have left me alone.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]

[name="Ensia"]  Stepping into another clan's territory without notice...
[dialog]
Even though her brother never went out of his way to discuss the other two clans with her, Ensia is no fool.
She knows that the Paleroche and Silverash clans have been at odds ever since Enciodes returned to Kjerag.
And before his latest trip, he specifically warned her not to have anything to do with the Paleroches unless absolutely necessary.
The situation in Kjerag was too delicate, and even a single careless whisper could trigger an avalanche.

Upon hearing Weiss's words, Ensia couldn't help but think back to what she saw in the cave.
The crystal-clear tearstones embedded in the rock wall, almost pulling her into a trance. As if they really were Kjeragandr's tears.
Twice had she plucked them from that wall for Uncle Tarja's sake, and the traces of her theft were left clearly in those vacant holes.
They mingle with dozens of other such scars, each of indeterminate age.
Ensia suddenly becomes uneasy, as if there were a conflict between her brother's development plans and the pristine beauty of the cave.
In an attempt to dispel some of her unease, she tries to change the topic.

[name="Kjarr"]  Then I'll be heading back. It's hard keeping away from Weiss's prying eyes.

[name="Ensia"]  So soon? I haven't even had a chance to properly thank you.

Ensia watches the door close in front of her and sighs softly, before painstakingly folding the opened letter back up and stowing it in her pocket.
She then turns around and begins to organize her backpack.
Halfway through, she feels something strange inside her bag.
She digs around and places what she finds in front of her.
Two pieces of candy.
One is from the Paleroche clan's reception room.
She racks her brain hard to figure out where the other piece came from. Only then does she recall eating it once as a child. It was found only at the Vine-Bear Court.
