Inside the dark tent, a tiny body is curled up on the bed.
The pain from his fever and exhaustion is canceling out the sedative effects of the medicine. He dreams a restless dream, where he is suddenly trying to find something.
Perhaps he seeks the embrace of his parents, or the warmth of his home.
But all those happy things had left him the day before. Even though he's not fully aware of it right now, his loss is no less painful in the dream.

The frail boy lies on his bed and reaches a hand out to the staff by his bedside.
He was the one who put this staff together, piece by piece, from broken parts and abandoned ore, until the moment a light shone from his hands.
'Light.' He kept thinking about that word. He wanted to shine a light to help those who helped him.

In his endless dreams, he bravely broke open the door his mother had locked, and powerfully sifted through all the shining debris at the factory. The scary disease the adults spoke of had no effect on him.
He used his mother's Arts to illuminate the sky. Under his light, the rescuers pulled unconscious workers out from the rubble one after another. His father had only minor injuries, and immediately joined the rescue team.
Then, after they got home, they moved far away, to a place without dust in the air.
He learned even more Arts, and lived a happy life with both his parents.

[name="Office Operator B"]Then... Do you know that you're sick?
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#7$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]I do... They told me before that you get rocks on your body when you catch this disease. A lot of people have it where I live.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Office Operator B"]Then... What about your parents? Are they both Infected?
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#7$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]Sí... There was an accident at the factory...
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Office Operator A"]......
[name="Office Operator A"]They got people Infected, then drove them into a corner. Those pendejos!
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic Operator"]Hey, not in front of the kid!
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Office Operator A"]My bad... I know I shouldn't get worked up, but I mean, it's just too...
[name="Office Operator A"]Hurry up and tell him. Just listening to this is pissing me off.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Office Operator B"]So we were talking last night, and we're thinking about introducing you to our company. You know, see if you're interested, or if you want to go.
[name="Office Operator B"]We have some medical equipment here, but it's leaps and bounds better on Rhodes Island. Besides, you know some electrical Arts, don't you?
[name="Office Operator B"]We have plenty of amazing folks there who know a ton of awesome Arts. You could learn a lot from them.
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#5$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]Even more awesome Arts?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Office Operator B"]Yep, that's right. By the way, who taught you yours?
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#10$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]I learned them from mi mamá...
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Office Operator A"]*Sigh*...
[name="Office Operator A"]Sorry, kid, I didn't mean to swear. We're sorry about you and your parents. We'll... keep looking for them.
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#10$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]Y-You don't have to apologize!
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]I...
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#12$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]Thank you so much for saving me, and... I also want to do something to return the favor.
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]I-I know a little electrical Arts. I woke up in the middle of the night last night, and it was so dark. There wasn't any light at all...
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]So you have no electricity here, right? Just like where I'm from? I... I was going to give you guys some electricity... to return the favor...
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]I saw how dark it was here. Did something happen to this place, too? But I... I passed out after a while, and when I woke up, I was back on this bed.
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#6$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]This is my staff. I was too tired last night, so it wasn't very bright, but... I can usually light up my whole house!
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic Operator"]So you came outside to light up our base?
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#10$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]Mm-hm!
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]When I use the Arts mi mamá taught me, I can make my staff glow for a really long time!
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]Was I any help?
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic Operator"]......!
[name="Medic Operator"](So that's why he...)
[name="Medic Operator"]Yes! You absolutely helped us.
[name="Medic Operator"]These two guys were lost last night, and you know how dark it was outside. It was thanks to your staff's light that they made it back.
[name="Medic Operator"]They were going to thank you, but forgot because of all the work we had this morning. Isn't that right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Office Operator B"]...Yeah! Totally slipped my mind!
[name="Office Operator B"]We were going to sleep it rough last night, but then we saw a faint light, which led us to you. We wouldn't have found our way without it!
[name="Office Operator B"](Winks)
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Office Operator A"](Gets the idea)
[name="Office Operator A"]That's right! Your light was real bright last night! Thanks, kid!
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#3$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]R-Really?
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]Then... I'll go! I'll get even better, and I'll learn even more awesome Arts, lots of them, then I'll come back to help you guys!
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic Operator"]Alright!
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#1$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]I know me being here isn't very helpful, but... I don't know where my parents are either, and I need you guys to help me find them...
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]I'll come back once I get better! I'll be back to light up the whole night sky!
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic Operator"]Alright, then we'll wait for you here. It's a promise. You gotta learn lots of useful Arts to help us out.
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#10$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]Okay!
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic Operator"]Right, what's your name anyway? We still don't know what to call you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=1)]
[name="Office Operator A"]Just so you know, we all have codenames here, but we've all known each other for a long time, so we just call each other by our real names.
[name="Office Operator A"]I'm Fernando, this is Pedro, and she's Rita.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_089",focus=2)]
[name="Office Operator B"]But now that you're going to the landship, you should pick a codename for yourself. Pick whatever you like.
[Character(name="avg_253_greyy_1#9$1")]
[name="Frail Perro Boy"]Hm...
