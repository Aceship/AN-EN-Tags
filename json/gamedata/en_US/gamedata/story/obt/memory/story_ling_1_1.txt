[name="Stonemason"]These last few days I keep dreaming that Catastrophes are striking nearby, everyone's panicking. All these different orders come flying out of the Tianshi Bureaus, and they make me chief constructor, in charge of rebuilding Shangshu's nomadic city.

[name="Stonemason"]But in the dream though! I find a solution!
[name="Stonemason"]The problem keeps gnawing at me after I'm chief constructor... until it suddenly hits me as I'm brewing tea.
[name="Stonemason"]All of Yan's rivers connect. Hundreds and hundreds of them, all linked to the sea too. The waterways are completely open. They're *natural lines* for nomadic cities to travel on.
[name="Stonemason"]And you know what say: 'water keeps a boat afloat.' If you combine the rivers with a nomadic city's own movement systems, it solves the lack of mobility from bearing all that load.

Scholars dream in hairpins wrought to flowers gold, beauties in red peonies by bridge's other end, and those who 'dream' as common folk, in matters devised, in feelings aroused. So in this nature does that stonesmith's dream lie.
The dream is fine, yet you believe it to pertain to fortune's scale. 'Twas dreamed however wanton, yet you do not dare interpret it however wanton.
Dreams, at the close, are merely dreams. The past, and future, always arise by themselves.

[name="Waregeist"]A teapot with a broken handle and no lid becomes a geist with broken legs and no arms. Anything of thin celadon can't even take a few hits...

[name="Waregeist"]Dusk's scrolls are a whole different world... You might be of brush and scrawls, but you're from Dusk's imagination, along with the paintings' limitless sights.
[name="Waregeist"]'Imagination' is the freest of all. With it, a leaf is a boat, rivers fold in waves, dead trees flower, gray hair is again lustrous, Heaven and Earth invert, and all things become hazy.

[name="Ink Spirit"]I ask you. There are several Ink Spirits here. Can you distinguish which were painted when Dusk joyed, and which when she grieved?

[name="Waregeist"]You all look roughly the same...
[Character(name="avg_npc_306_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_143#1", focus=2)]
[name="Ink Spirit"]Correct. Not even we know what mood she had in painting us. Perhaps it was only done... emotionlessly.
[name="Ink Spirit"]But you, while your body is brown, your belly is deep black, stained by a dozen years of boiling tea. I could smell its scent, your scent, before you even approached.
[name="Ink Spirit"]Geists of the fine arts are snobbish. Geists of weapons of war indulge in violence. When a geist is impervious, we know its body has been tempered by heat and flame.
[name="Ink Spirit"]You're born with a basis, something to abide by. You're restricted, but that doesn't have to be your end. That is your meaning.
[name="Ink Spirit"]In a Waregeist, you can see the ware itself, and even moreso the one who used it. Even when one dies, the ware itself remains.
[name="Ink Spirit"]Ink Spirits though? We're a rootless gust. We breeze by and we're gone. Depending on Dusk's mood, she may even tear a scroll apart. What of the scrawls on it?
[name="Ink Spirit"]Ware, do you still envy this freedom without root?
[Character(name="avg_npc_306_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_143#1", focus=1)]

Another poets' gathering, it seems.
White porcelain cups descend with the current, their wine and the springwater of miscible hue. By whom the cups stop, so must they compose three phrases. Those whose vivacities seize not, accept the cup prostrate, and so form this 'stream party'.
The wine is peach-plum eve's brew, picked of early-blossoming peach buds, together pounded with stored evening plum into a liquor, cold and pure and sweet, mouthwatering within the mouth.

The girl of laketop song casts a pocket of water chestnuts into the vessel's hold, but carelessly kicks the oar flying, out and away. Crisp cries and hollers travel out for li and li beyond.
The rain twixt spring and summer still falls half a month hence, the fog from striking flagstones as fine as smoke. The neighbors, separated by rain's curtain, grumble for when the hall can dry.
Tea's lovers contest with tea, wine's with wine, angling's with angling, the wealthy with gold and jade, the poor with chirruping bugs...
Oh, lest we forget, the lantern festival. Far livelier than a party by a stream, each lantern unto its own style, lit from street's head to tail, and over the celebration extinguishing not even through the night.
In each step taken is earned a phrase, in each sight seen is earned a verse, and so in those poets' gatherings have never I lost.
In river water's mist a lotus sits; wine calls to deepest parts rinsed clear by waves.

That nomadic city.
That nomadic city laid before the desert.
[character(name="avg_2023_ling_1#1$1")]
Though it was centuries ago, I still remember the shock when first I saw it. In this instant, I find myself once again stood atop its tower gate.
The desert unbroken for endless li, sandstorms hanging heat in waves, mist vast and far. I can feel as the water departs from my skin.
So as to occupy a water source, its construction takes not into account the occupation of strategic terrain. It treats mountain ranges as barriers, and approaches the meadows and lakes.
And so, the dry wind sweeps the wide open desert, fluttering against the city walls. It seems a lone titan, towering through Heaven and Earth's interstice, its body unyielding.
The banners roll free. The sun sets long upon the river.
Outside the gate, the soldiers are porting the corpses of their brothers fallen yesterday in the cause, piled clean row by row. In turn I pass them by, closing each of their eyes.
One's ears hear still the bloody battles of yesterday. Arrows shadow out the sun, the sky as if night, the sounds of slaughter as if tearing silk. Continuing, uninterrupted.
Torches are lit beneath their bodies. Not a one weeps, for a new battle is near. Smoke rolls, but the wind soon blows it into the boundless desert.

Poetry and wine have already helped me forget so much I once hated, yet before such a scene, and before I come to my senses, I have already grasped my armaments again.
For every soldier and command by me has grasped their own.
We cannot let those fools approach the Yan at our backs. It is their home. Home of their loved ones.
Stood long, before this desert without end, is not the titan that is the nomadic city, but its soldiers.

A lone city to hear the drums of war. The Years are not asked. Heroism is let unabated.
Who spake that generals willed to die—old bulwarks birth new willows year on year.
[name="Ling"]He was not wrong... I was meant to come here.

Awaken.
The wine is run dry.
A fine dream.
What did I see?
The setting light blazing through the clouds midair. Three mounts and eighteen peaks. The endless paths of Shu. The tentacles that are haze. This scenery never before put into painting, nor into poetry.
What did I see?
A poets' gathering at a stream, porcelain cups stopping before one person after another. A long pavilion upon the desert, and in the lone smoke, centuries of people beating the drums of expedition.
I saw both the me contented and unfettered, and the me who sought all solutions, not their details. Dreams are but dreams, for my sake I am, and I am pleased.
Though I am clearly at Zuanjiang Summit, vacant and nameless, it is like I can see the whole of Yan. Nay, the whole of far antiquity, the length and breadth in all directions, all as if the wind flitting past my side.
To see mountains yet now question of stone, to near pools yet now forget of water; such is primality. Perhaps this place should be named the 'Field of Forgotten Water', then.
......
It is as if... I have seen Nian and Dusk too. Heh. Though we have met not in dreams, I assume out of them we very soon will meet again.
[name="Ling"]Hah... The sun is through, and water runs yet long... while snowfall flows through vacant moonlit sky.
