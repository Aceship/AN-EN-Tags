The surroundings are silent, save for the deafening roar of the waterfall. Asbestos climbs against the raging current, tugging at her rope, the top of which is swallowed by the splashing foam.
It is always the same—climbing towards unknown heights, or descending into unknown depths.
She knows that there is a stunning view at her destination, but not what difficulties that she might encounter on the way.
It could be a slip, a fall, wild beasts, snowstorms, or perhaps some disaster or challenge she could never imagine.

She knows how it feels to lose her balance in rapid currents, pushing her lungs to the limit in suffocating whirlpools.
She knows how it feels to keep climbing through the night after breaking her arm from a fall halfway up, just to catch a glimpse of the sunrise from the top.
She knows how it feels to slip and fall on a glacier, the ice chips ripping through her skin.
But she also remembers seeing the rays of the setting sun reflect upon the icy surface when she stood up again, accompanied by a sweet icy breeze.
At that moment, Asbestos no longer cared about her bleeding wounds. All the pain and suffering, all the hardship—it was all worth it.

The Archosauria are wet and muddy, with pieces of grass in their hair.
