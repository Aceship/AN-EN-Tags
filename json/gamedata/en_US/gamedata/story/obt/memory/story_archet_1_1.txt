We are here today to commemorate the past, and to welcome a new beginning.
All who stand with me today are my brothers and sisters. Fate has brought us together, and every bond that we formed is a gift given to us by the monastery.
We will not forget the bread and the beer, nor the bells and the fields. We will not forget the Law that we studied, nor the love that we shared.
We meet here today to bid farewell to Landen Monastery.

A long line forms in front of an unremarkable booth in a corner of this great city.
The setting sun paints the people's heads golden as a Liberi girl continues to give out bread to the people in line, to the tune of hymns arranged with drumbeat loops.
A peaceful scene, reminiscent of a mural in a cathedral.
