[name="Courteous Durin"]We made lots of improvements after the last battle, but our careful tests show that the Giant, Ultimate Ugly Thing series is no match for you even after all our upgrades.
[name="Courteous Durin"]That's why I came up with one last trick: have the Giant, Ultimate Ugly Thing Mk. 4 blow itself up.
[character(name="avg_npc_575_1#1$1",name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]But you didn't have to self-destruct the minute we start, right?
[character(name="avg_npc_575_1#1$1",name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Courteous Durin"]...I did that because I was working out what you'd do.
[name="Courteous Durin"]And I figured that we were never going to win even if with the self-destruct.
[name="Courteous Durin"]It's to show that we're accepting our defeat. I had no other choice!
