[name="Doc"]Restraint? Let me ask you. Are there any heavy alcoholics in town?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_223",focus="l")]
[name="Local Official"]Well... of course... and a few of them at that, but what does this have to do with that?

[name="Doc"]May I ask which of these two methods are more restrained to you, then: To hope that they turn around before they drink themselves to death, or to let them drown their sorrows in drink because they have no other option?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_223",focus="l")]
[name="Local Official"]Sir... my previous words were spoken out of respect, so I hope you don't get the wrong idea.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_4125_rdoc_1#11$1",focus="r")]
[name="Doc"]Certainly. My words at Stonebreak Village came from my responsibility as a doctor. That includes what I've just said to you. The same applies here.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_223",focus="l")]
[name="Local Official"]Then should I say to you 'I'll abide by the doctor's orders'?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_4125_rdoc_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Doc"]I hope you will.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_223",focus="l")]
[name="Local Official"]It's a shame that I feel no need to take a doctor's advice seriously.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_4125_rdoc_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Doc"]Certainly. You're not the only one. I hope you don't end up needing a doctor's services.
