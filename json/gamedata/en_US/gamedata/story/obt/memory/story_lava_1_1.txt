[name="Lava"]You're the literal last person I want to hear this from!!
[name="Lava"]But my fortune telling didn't miss. It was my fated encounter!
[name="Lava"]If I hadn't followed the caravan for Leithania, I would've never met my teacher, and if he never taught me music, then I'd definitely be having a hard time learning Originium Arts now!
[character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_150_snakekiller_1",focus=2)]
[name="Cuora"]Oh, that's true. You learn Originium Arts really good and fast too...
[name="Cuora"]The instructors and Pith all say you're great. And the elite operator sir I saw last mission, with the stiff face and the eyes like this, and the weirdly nice voice, he said so too!
[name="Cuora"]Actually, you've been going to the training grounds every day. Is that because you're learning from that operator guy?

[name="Lava"]Tch. I'd like to be, but when would something that good ever happen?
[name="Lava"]How would someone as important as Master Logos ever have the time to teach me specifically? Just the couple of words he gave last time are already amazing enough...
[name="Lava"]And what was with your description of him just now?
