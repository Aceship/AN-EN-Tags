'I thought there was no limit to knowledge held here, and that I could find the answer that I sought—the cure to your disease.'

'What if I exhaust all the knowledge here—like draining dry the Siestan sea—and I still cannot find my answer?'

[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#8$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=2)]
[name="Rinz"]	D-Don't get the wrong idea! It's a compliment.
[name="Rinz"]	—Right, is it fine if I ask you a question?
[name="Rinz"]	Are you perhaps really close friends with an Infected?
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]	Eh?!
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]	...Yes, I am. She's really dear to me.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=2)]
[name="Rinz"]	Is she well?
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]	Her condition has been very stable. Nothing can bring her down. Not even Oripathy.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=2)]
[name="Rinz"]	That's good to hear.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]	Also, she's not in Victoria, so... the regulations here don't apply to her. If you want to—
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=2)]
[name="Rinz"]	No, no. I mean no ill will, and I don't think it's bizarre or anything.
[name="Rinz"]	We're Originium researchers. Any of us could one day become infected because of an accident during an experiment or observation. Perhaps even deliberately.
[name="Rinz"]	We know what it is, or at least we're closer to knowing than most.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]	Thank you, Rinz.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=2)]
[name="Rinz"]	*Sigh*. I should be the one thanking you.
[name="Rinz"]	Just like you have a dream to cure Oripathy, which led you to come all the way to the Victorian National University, even I have a tiny dream of my own.
[name="Rinz"]	I know that all scholars dream of accomplishing what's never been done. I know we'll have to walk this road to the end before forging a new path forward on our own, but... I'm not ready for it yet.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]	Accomplishing what's never been done...
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=2)]
[name="Rinz"]	—Fortunately, I have a fine role model like you around me.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#11$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]	Is that so? Can... Can I really become someone like that?
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#11$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=2)]
[name="Rinz"]	Just take the compliment. And don't give me that look.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]	No, please pay it no mind. I just thought of something else... I think I finally realized something.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]	Oh, and I must insist on returning your gift. We simply didn't know each other well enough. That's nothing to apologize for.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=2)]
[name="Rinz"]	Uh, about that, I hadn't got to the important part yet.
[name="Rinz"]	Actually, the reason I wanted to apologize is that I was too scared of talking to you to tell you that the Originium sample we collected from the Catastrophe ground zero had a rare reaction.

[name="Ceylon"]	What?!
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_032",focus=2)]
[name="Rinz"]	I'm not too confident in my own experimental methods and observations. I kept thinking that maybe it was nothing special and I just didn't recognize it.
[name="Rinz"]	But it'd be so embarrassing to ask you to take a look and have you tell me that to my face!
[name="Rinz"]	Which is why, even though I knew you would be more interested in its progress than any of us, I didn't dare to tell you—
