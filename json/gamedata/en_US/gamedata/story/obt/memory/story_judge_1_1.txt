[name="Lavinia"]That person presented me with a box containing the glove and hammer I wield now.
[name="Lavinia"]Back then, I thought that if I hid behind him... I might not be able to stand up for myself for the rest of my life.
[name="Lavinia"]So I took the weapon he gave me and walked ahead of him.
[name="Lavinia"]Now that I'm recalling all this, I think that's what he hoped I'd do. And he'd also hope I would do this today.
[name="Lavinia"]Mafiosi always treat death like it is inevitable, as merely the result of solving a problem.
[name="Lavinia"]This cycle of violence is how they live and survive.
[name="Lavinia"]Long, long ago, a bunch of people walked in the rain into an alley with no lights. They would either die in there, or come out with blood on their hands.
[name="Lavinia"]Then, they went further, deeper into the alley, and gradually forgot why they were there in the first place. And in the end, they saw that narrow alley as a full-width street.
[name="Lavinia"]Siracusa is a labyrinth of narrow alleys, even dead ends.
[name="Lavinia"]The people living inside the maze don't have many choices to make.
[name="Lavinia"]If the choice was between people like me or the famiglie, I'd rather insist on keeping you by my side.
[name="Lavinia"]But you don't have to become me, and I'm not hoping for that either.
[name="Lavinia"]I'd much rather be able to take you outside this labyrinth entirely.

[name="Luna"]What's outside of it?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4065_judge_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Lavinia"]Roads. Many wide open roads.
