[name="Tucker"]Too bad then.
[name="Tucker"]Being a plant hunter is so much cooler than being stuck in a lab rinsing test tubes and sticking labels on specimens all day! If I were you, I wouldn't trade the job for the world!
[name="Tucker"]How about this—you don't have to help with my field report if you can take me along plant-hunting once! Pretty please!

As he speaks, Verdant closes the lid of the thornbloom's incubator and opens up another specimen case, which is smaller and warmer.
He feels the moisture of the soil within using his fingertip. Then, he gives the glass walls of the case a spritz from his spray bottle.

Lit up in the fire, Verdant beholds the sight within the case clearer than anything.
His grass can't handle the sharp rise in temperature well.
Its millet-like leaves are wilted, and its sedge-like stem is drooped. But the part that resembled bristlegrass is actually blooming.
Is that its flower? Did the fire cause the transformation? Verdant isn't sure.
No one can know for sure it is a kind of flower when they see its delicate tendrils for the first time.
The plant doesn't look like it is blooming at all with its wilted leaves and drooped stem.
But Verdant is certain that the grass is not millet, sedge, or any other kind of grass he's encountered before.
