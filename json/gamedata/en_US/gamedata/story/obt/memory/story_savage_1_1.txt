[name="Savage"]Of course I missed you all, and I mean, I know my hometown mines like nothing else.

[Character(name="char_230_savage_1",name2="avg_npc_005",focus=2)]
[name="Johnny"]No, I heard you picked up a big job. Digging those 'goods' out one after another's cost two years of our time.
[name="Johnny"]All the workers reckon it has to be something happened outside.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1",name2="avg_npc_005",focus=1)]
[name="Savage"]Lots of engineering going on. But I'm only on the bog-standard stuff.
[name="Savage"]Cooperation this time was to make sure the 'goods' going from Rim Billiton to Babel had a safe journey and made it without hassle. They needed a security crew to see it through.
[name="Savage"]And just like that, the hull and core our mining firm dug up gets sent straight to Babel.
[name="Savage"]I had some security work to do with them. That's it.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1",name2="avg_npc_005",focus=2)]

[name="Johnny"]Not complaining, though. Let the Sarkaz sort out their own biz! Maybe it's a good thing they muddled it up when it mattered.
[name="Johnny"]But if Babel wasn't there to rope you in, would you have any other reason?
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1",name2="avg_npc_005",focus=1)]
[name="Savage"]I used to be so sure, you know, I'd live my whole life in the mines.

[name="Johnny"]That was your chance to take a gander out there, wasn't it? When you left Rim Billiton.

[name="Savage"]Ha, haha...
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Johnny, I... got to know a kid like me.
[name="Savage"]You know how hard it is, with the Sarkaz life all around you, trying to grow up healthy.
[name="Savage"]But she chose to take it on. She learned to endure, to persevere, and kept hope in her heart all along.
[name="Savage"]So much more she still needs to know and learn. She was always wrapped around me, asking me all sorts of questions.
[name="Savage"]She likes the food I make, and she's especially interested in Rim Billiton's fables.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1",name2="avg_npc_005",focus=2)]

[name="Savage"]Yes.
[name="Savage"]I do. I do wanna protect her.
[name="Savage"]But now's not the time. I've got no reason to stay there, and none of the skill to guide her forward.

[name="Johnny"]You little girlie... prezzies, of course it's prezzies, to mark the occasion!

[name="Savage"]Haha, I'm having you on. How could I forget?
[name="Savage"]I didn't know if I'd have another chance to leave after I came back, so I made sure to buy whole trunks of stuff, and brought it back myself.
[name="Savage"]Here. A top-of-the-line hearing aid I picked up in Victoria, just for you.

[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Hello, can I ask who you...
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Ah, you're the one from the Security team! You carried the first of the wounded over, too.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Just call me Savage. I'm here to see how they're doing.
[name="Savage"]One of the casualties just now... should be registered as 'John.'
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Mister John, is it? Please be assured, our Medic Operators have already administered emergency treatment to him.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Is... How are his injuries?
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Right. Originium crystals penetrated to his arm and the flank of his abdomen. This ruptured his protective gear, and the amount of Originium particulate he inhaled afterwards also...
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]So, he's already been infected for sure, hasn't he?
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Y... Yes.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Damn it. Too slow.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]However, we've made use of Rhodes Island injective medication in the treatment already given to Mister John, and that's prevented any further progression of infection.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]What...? But, with injuries that bad, and wounds directly from active Originium crystals...
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]I do understand your concern, Miss.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Just... call me Savage. You said your drug injection stopped the spread? Is that true?
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Yes, Miss Savage. All the personnel carried in so far have been administered emergency medication in accordance with their level of injury and severity of infection.
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Some patients are not out of danger yet due to their overly severe blood loss, but their Originium infection symptoms have been fundamentally suppressed.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]All suppressed?
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Yes, every one... Do you have any issues?
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]No. Thing is, even if the drug works some wonders, it's not something you can give to workers straight away.
[name="Savage"]Rim Billiton's extant medical orgs all use cheap Originium infection meds, and they only do so little for workers who're already infected.
[name="Savage"]But then Rhodes Island...
[name="Savage"]You're a volunteer aid group, aren'tcha? These emergency meds aren't cheap, and the doses are pretty staggering. You all...
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Er, I—I'm not responsible for any of that at all...
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]But, I can promise you, Mister John's already out of mortal danger. He'll be able to receive visitors before long.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]It's not the same... Once they're Infected, workers' fates are already sealed.
[name="Savage"]They're forced into even cheaper labor, sent to the exhausted mineshafts for all the most brutal, dangerous work, collecting remainders.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]I'm sorry. When they arrived, most of the patients had already...
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]No, I should be the one apologizing here. I'm sorry, you've already done so much and then some... thank you, a million times.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Miss Savage, I... I understand your feelings.
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Director Kal'tsit once instructed us that no matter how many wounds we heal, how much Oripathy we suppress...
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Once you've become Infected, no matter how unreasonable it is, most of society has already turned against you.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]That's right. Kal'tsit told you some...
[name="Savage"]......
[stopmusic(fadetime=2)]
[name="Savage"]Huh?
[name="Savage"]Who did you—just say your director was?
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Kal'tsit. She's an example to all our Medic Operators at Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Director... Kal'tsit...
[name="Savage"]Don't tell me...!
[name="Savage"]Who—Who's your leader? At Rhodes Island—What's the name of your leader at this Rhodes Island place?
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]She's, um...
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Tell me. Please, I need to know.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]She's called...
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Our leader's, Rhodes Island's current leader's name is—
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]'Amiya.'
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]...A... miya...
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Excuse me, is there a problem?
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]How is it Amiya...? If it really is her, she shouldn't be much older right now than—
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Mm-hm, yes, our leader is considerably young.
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]But... you'll know once you talk to her, even once. She has wisdom beyond her years and a strong will. She's a truly outstanding leader.
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]Miss Savage, might you know some... Are you an old acquaintance of Amiya's, possibly?
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Ah... um, we... were good friends since long ago.
[name="Savage"]Can you... Can you get in contact with Amiya? Just say my name, and she'll know.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Rhodes Island Medic Operator"]I see. Amiya did mention she had a very close friend who might be here in Rim Billiton now...
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]It... It really is Amiya... Can I go see her? How?
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
