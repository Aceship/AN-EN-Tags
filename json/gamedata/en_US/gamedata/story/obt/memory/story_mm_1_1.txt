[charslot(slot = "middle", name = "avg_133_mm_1#7$1")]
[name="Metis"]How could this be...?
[name="Metis"]The killer would not keep such a clue with them. They would try to destroy it at the first opportunity. Fire would be the safest way to do so.
[charslot(slot = "middle", name = "avg_133_mm_1#6$1")]
[name="Metis"]Could it be... Originium Arts?
[charslot(slot = "middle", name = "avg_133_mm_1#8$1")]
[name="Metis"]A skilled caster could destroy evidence by conjuring flames out of nothing. That would make it impossible to find a clue.
[charslot(slot = "middle", name = "avg_133_mm_1#9$1")]
[name="Metis"]Or not... it was an Originium ornament. Those things don't burn so easily. There must be some trace.

[name="Heidi"]But we've searched the entire manor.
[charslot(slot = "middle", name = "avg_133_mm_1#7$1")]
