When Skadi opened her eyes on the beach, she found not a single soul by her side.
Ægir. Abyssal Hunters. All lives on the line, flesh to flesh, blood to blood.
None of it seemed to exist.
Only the sounds of the waves and the wind stirred in her ears.

She can understand what circumstances lead them to feel what sentiments.
And it is exactly this that vexes her more and more. It is for this that she feels guilt.
But she cannot divulge these feelings to the villagers. She can only hasten the swing of the greatsword in her hand.
