[Character(name="avg_365_aprl_1#3$1")]

[Character(name="avg_365_aprl_1#7$1")]

[name="Aerlie"]Oh, but I'm actually no good with lying. You might have to help me smooth things out to sound convincing.

[name="Aerlie"]After we get past the guards, we just have to avoid everyone along the way.

[name="Bandit Leader"]You sure make it sound easy.
[character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="avg_365_aprl_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aerlie"]Well, I am a hunter after all, and I'm good at staying hidden. The beasties never see me, even with how keen their senses are.
[character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="avg_365_aprl_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aerlie"]If we are seen though, let me think... playing it cool is probably the best option. We don't look that suspicious, so it's not like strangers will remember our faces.
[character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="avg_365_aprl_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Bandit Leader"]Heh. Alright then, I'll lead the way.
[name="Bandit Leader"]Hunter... why are you doing this for us? Do we look so pathetic you're taking pity on us?
[character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="avg_365_aprl_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aerlie"]Uhh, I wouldn't put it that way...
[character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="avg_365_aprl_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aerlie"]Maybe it's because I have a question I'd like answered.

[name="Bandit Leader"]Don't think we'll take an IOU or anything like that. I want to see cold, hard cash.
[name="Bandit Leader"]If we hadn't trusted you in the first place, you would've gotten a visit from us a long time ago.

[character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="avg_npc_007",focus=1)]

[name="Apprehensive Bandit"]Sure... But can't we take a bit more?
[character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="avg_npc_007",focus=1)]
[name="Bandit Leader"]It's just in case we get caught. Plus, I'd like to show this asshole what it means to have some dignity.
[character]
[name="Mine Supervisor"]You're just an Infected. What do you know about dignity?
[name="Mine Supervisor"]And that hunter over there... Who exactly are you? I thought you were here to ask for compensation too.
[Character(name="avg_365_aprl_1#2$1")]
[name="Aerlie"]Oh... Actually, I just wanted to ask you a question.
[Character(name="avg_365_aprl_1#5$1")]
[name="Aerlie"]Since you're not hurting for cash or anything, why would you take compensation money from the Infected who need it to survive?
[character]
[name="Mine Supervisor"]It's not like they'll ever be employable again, so the money would just vanish into thin air, right? It'd be a damn shame to waste perfectly good money on the Infected.
[character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Bandit Leader"]You're a real piece of shit.
[name="Bandit Leader"]Hunter, you went through all this effort just to ask that question?

[character(name="avg_npc_008")]

[name="Aerlie"]Of course not. I didn't like what he said at all.

Aerlie, if you want to say goodbye to them in person, this is your last chance.
If you want to ask your friends if they'll still accept you despite being Infected, this is also the best chance for that. While you're not too distant, while your relationship is still tight-knit.
