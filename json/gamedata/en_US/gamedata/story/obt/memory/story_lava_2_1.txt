[Character(name="char_121_lava_1")]
[name="Lava"]Now, I guess.
[name="Lava"]Lemme get it.
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Ah-ah-ah, don't get up. You knocked out all the way from yesterday to today and now you want to be up and about?

[name="Lava"](When did Hibiscus get this strong?)
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]I asked around a little. It was Pith who got you into this state after taking you out for special training.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#3")]
[name="Lava"]This isn't Miss Pith's fault.
[name="Lava"]This was going to be a high-intensity training session, anyway. It might look pretty ruthless at first, but nothing ever starts smooth. I'll be fine after I'm used to it.
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Still, you can't wreck yourself with training like this...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#3")]
[name="Lava"]I think it's worth it. I can feel how I'm getting stronger, Originium Arts precision or otherwise, training like this.
[name="Lava"]Besides...
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Besides?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#3")]
[name="Lava"]I was warned about this training, going into it. It'd be majorly intense, it'd be tough making it through and I'd need a good mentality and so on.
[name="Lava"]I told the instructors: 'It's fine. My sister's a medic. Even if I end up half dead, as long as I still have breath in me, she'll bring me back.'
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]......
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1")]

[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Lava.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#3")]
[name="Lava"]What?
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]I'll overlook it this time, but if you end up like this after special training again, I'll officially raise dissent with the HR department.

[Character(name="char_121_lava_1")]
[name="Lava"]I'm alright, aren't I...?
[name="Lava"]Just a little overdraft on my strength. And a few grazes.
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]No, not this...
[name="Hibiscus"]Do you still remember... how you ended up at Rhodes Island...?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1")]
[name="Lava"]That...
[name="Lava"]I helped a bunch of merchants repel some bandits, and someone noticed I was an Infected...
[name="Lava"]Then their caravan dumped me... and I remember someone or other bashed my head in. Then I passed out.
[name="Lava"]And when I woke up again, I was aboard Rhodes Island.
[name="Lava"]And somebody'd healed my injuries.
[name="Lava"]I heard an operator in the field picked me up on the way back? Lucky thing I was only minorly injured. Wasn't much trouble for others.
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]They were heavy injuries...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#2")]
[name="Lava"]Huh?
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]I thought, after I lost touch with you, the next time we met, you'd still be the same awkward you, but...
[name="Hibiscus"]Then you were on the operating table, Lava—burnt up like a fireball...
[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=15, ystrength=15, vibrato=20, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Hibiscus"]I couldn't... do anything to help...

[name="Hibiscus"]You were—crying my name, non-stop, in your bed...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#2")]
[name="Lava"]What? Wait, I never heard about this before...
[name="Lava"]Then—Then why didn't you tell me—
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=30, ystrength=30, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Hibiscus"]Because I knew you'd act out if you got awkward! It was so tough just finding you. What if you just ran away again?
[name="Hibiscus"]So before you recovered and officially came on board, I didn't even dare show up.
[name="Hibiscus"]Ugh...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1")]
[name="Lava"]I'm not—I'm not that unreasonable.
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Of course you are!
[name="Hibiscus"]You got lost when we left Victoria BECAUSE you were being so difficult, Lava!
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1")]
[name="Lava"]That—That was an accident...
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]In any case, you can't let anything like this happen again. Do you understand?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#3")]
[name="Lava"](Quietly) Okay...
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Mm-hm. There's a good girl.
[name="Hibiscus"]Oh, that's right. What were you dreaming about?
[name="Hibiscus"]If you don't mind, you're safe to share some of your dreams with your sister. It'll be good for your recuperation.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#2")]

[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
