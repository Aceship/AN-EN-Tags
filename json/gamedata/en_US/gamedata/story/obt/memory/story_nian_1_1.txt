[character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]

[character(name="char_007_closre_1")]
[name="Ke Luxi"] Ha, I did say so... but I'm wondering. With a weapon that exceptional, do you even still need my formula?

[name="Yi"] The need is not mine, but the people of Shangshu's.
[name="Yi"] A Catastrophe passed through, and many are displaced. Shangshu is troubled. If they had the 'Divine Meteonite,' safe shelter from the elements could be built that much faster.
[name="Yi"] Sir K'o, our mutual contention is but a thing of the past. No further argument, nor hate, supersedes the common folk. A victor in this duel of swords is clear. In mind and heart, you ought to—

[name="Yi"] Ke Luxi, you did all this just to...
[character(name="char_007_closre_1")]
[name="Ke Luxi"] Correct. I just couldn't understand! My swordsmithing technique is apex, it's peak! So how does it still not beat hers?!
[name="Ke Luxi"] I've been tossing and turning this past decade, dying just to get my hands on a sword of her own making. I'll research it, engineer it, figure out just what kind of art went into making it!
[name="Ke Luxi"] I should really thank you for coming all this way, just to drop her sword off with us.
[name="Ke Luxi"] Now, be nice and give up the goods, and I'll let you go.
[character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Yi"] So be it...
[name="Yi"] This complete swindle isn't worth arguing with you over. If there never was any 'Divine Meteonite,' then I don't want to bother with you for even a second longer.
[character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#4")]
[name="Yi"] And yet this sword's time with me is borrowed. I must return it as agreed. I can't let you take it.

[name="Dusk"] I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Hurry up and leave.
[Character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#7$1", name2="avgnew_2015_dusk_1#5$1", focus=1)]
[name="Nian"] And since when did you start being able to sleep again?

[name="Dusk"] ......
[Character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#6$1", name2="avgnew_2015_dusk_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="Nian"] Admit it, li'l sis. We're all still in a dream. It's so crammed with interesting stuff, it's got us forgetting just how fragile the dream really is.
[name="Nian"] But we'll have to wake up at some point.
[Character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#6$1", name2="avgnew_2015_dusk_1#9$1", focus=2)]
[name="Dusk"] Suit yourself. How do you plan to take a dream out with you?
[Character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#1$1", name2="avgnew_2015_dusk_1#9$1", focus=1)]
[name="Nian"] First, find a way to make it carry on a little longer. If we're going to wake up no matter what, then I'd like to ready up a giant firecracker, and blow this dream apart with my own hands.
