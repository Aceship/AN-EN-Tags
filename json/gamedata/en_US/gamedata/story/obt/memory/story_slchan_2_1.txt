[name="Cliffheart"]I can agree with that.
[name="Cliffheart"]I thought all Sankta were like Exusiai, but now I know there are all kinds of problems between Sankta too.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_361_1#2$1")]
[name="Velliv"]Understanding that is the first step to understanding Laterano.
[name="Velliv"]By the way, if I recall correctly, the Kjeragandr statue three years in the making is nearly complete. You should be traveling to Kjerag for the unveiling ceremony, shouldn't you?
[name="Velliv"]I could give you a ride, if you want.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#8$1")]
[name="Cliffheart"]...
[name="Cliffheart"]Actually, I have a different request. A rather brazen one, I should say.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_361_1#4$1")]
[name="Velliv"]Oh?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
[name="Cliffheart"]I would like to travel with Samara and learn more about Laterano and the Sankta. Is that okay?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_361_1#4$1")]
[name="Velliv"]Are you not planning to go back?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
[name="Cliffheart"]Not yet.
[name="Cliffheart"]This whole thing has given me a lot of food for thought. Maybe there's no real point trying to force them back together.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#2$1")]
[name="Cliffheart"]Maybe they've already sat down together while I've been away.
[name="Cliffheart"]If they understand each other, if both of them have Kjerag in their hearts, if they're headed for the same goal, just by different paths...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#10$1")]
[name="Cliffheart"]Then I should cast my eyes forward, too.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]
[name="Velliv"]...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
[name="Cliffheart"]You came looking for me, didn't you?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]
[name="Velliv"]Yes. I had made up my mind to come personally when I heard your name from Samara, and what the two of you talked about.
[name="Velliv"]While formal relations were established between Kjerag and Laterano at the Summit of Nations, the Kjeragandr and Lateran faiths have lacked a catalyst for dialogue.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#6$1")]
[name="Cliffheart"]I'll be the catalyst.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]
[name="Velliv"]...
[name="Velliv"]Kjerag is certainly in need of cultural dialogue, and there is no doubt that His Holiness will welcome such dialogue with open arms.
[name="Velliv"]But I must ask you again, one last time.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_361_1#7$1")]
[name="Velliv"]Do you understand what you're doing, Lady Ensia Silverash?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
[name="Cliffheart"]...
[name="Cliffheart"]Yes.

[Delay(time=1)]
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_361_1#5$1")]
[name="Velliv"]In that case, I welcome you on behalf of Laterano.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
[name="Cliffheart"]Thanks.
[name="Cliffheart"]Oh, but I'll need to visit the nearest Rhodes Island branch office first.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#10$1")]
[name="Cliffheart"]I'll need them to help me find a home for Tiana, and ask the Doctor to deliver a message to my brother.
