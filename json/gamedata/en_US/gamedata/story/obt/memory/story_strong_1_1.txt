[name="Jaye"] I don't mean a normal street fight. I mean like two gangs of mean-looking people fighting each other.

[name="Uncle Wong"] For a while last month, there was a group of people hauling crates here every night.
[name="Uncle Wong"] Normally I wouldn't give it a second thought, but all their crates were wrapped up in black. It all looked very shady.

[name="Hoshiguma"] Hahaha, don't be so nervous. The L.G.D.'s actually been following this case for a while now.
[name="Hoshiguma"] Guess there's no harm in telling you. Most of their weapon cache actually got strewn all over the streets after their last rumble. The L.G.D. tried to retrieve as much as we could, but the Char Sius still managed to get their hands on a decent chunk of what's left.

[name="Jaye"] I-Isn't that dangerous?
[character(name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5", name2="avg_272_strong_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"] Yeah, though they didn't have the guts to smuggle the weapons themselves.
[name="Hoshiguma"] They were thinking of taking out the brand new Originium Devices on the weapons, and selling those instead. Of course, that's illegal too.
[character(name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#2", name2="avg_272_strong_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"] The L.G.D. apprehended the Lou Seois' boss the other day. He was looking for a buyer for the stolen goods, you see.
[name="Hoshiguma"] He's pretty tight-lipped. Couldn't get much out of him. We owe you a great deal tonight. It's all thanks to your plan that we managed to apprehend all these people.
[character(name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#3", name2="avg_272_strong_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"] Though come to think of it, you really shouldn't do anything so dangerous again.

[name="Jaye"] I see, so that's how it is...

[character(name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5", name2="avg_272_strong_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"] Hold on.
[name="Hoshiguma"] Truth be told, I've actually been keeping an eye on you too. With your skills, I think you're a bit overqualified to be a mere street hawker.
[name="Hoshiguma"] I know a much better gig for you. How about it?
[character(name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5", name2="avg_272_strong_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Jaye"] Well... I appreciate the offer, ma'am.
[name="Jaye"] Though just as Lungmen needs police officers like you, it needs seafood hawkers like me too. It's not about qualifications.
[name="Jaye"] Anyway, I don't think what I'm doing right now is so bad...
[character(name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5", name2="avg_272_strong_1#2$1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"] Haha, I get you. Of course, I'll respect your decision. If you ever have a change of heart, though, you know where to find me.
[character(name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5", name2="avg_272_strong_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Jaye"] Thanks for your work. I'm gonna head back now.
[character(name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1", name2="avg_272_strong_1#2$1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"] Oh, and be sure to pay the L.G.D. a visit after the holidays for your certificate!
