[name="Mauro, Infected Citizen"]The gangsters were backed by different famiglie, and they fought until one side drove the other completely out of town and took control.
[name="Mauro, Infected Citizen"]The 'judge' you met earlier was just an ordinary mafiosa used by the winning famiglia to control us here.

[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]And even though so many people knew that you weren't the source of the curse, and that you were completely innocent... nobody was willing to those words out loud.
