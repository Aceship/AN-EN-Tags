[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]Take a seat.
[name="Zofia"]Let's just call this an interview. I'm sure you've got pages of questions you've been itching to ask.

[name="Immature Reporter"]But—
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]My name's Zofia, formerly known as the Whislash Knight, now retired. A sister to both Maria and the Radiant Knight. Well, technically their aunt, but whatever.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]I'm also a VIP at Golden Palm Bank, a super-VIP at the Starlight Street shopping mall, and a swindled customer of various real estate moguls... Oh right, and occasionally the center of attention for the tabloids.

[name="Immature Reporter"]I've watched the recordings of all your matches, and read every article... You were different during each phase of your career.

[name="Immature Reporter"]Oh, here it is. It's from this time... You wore a ponytail back then, just like Maria.
[name="Immature Reporter"]After the Radiant Knight left, the decline of the Nearl family was inevitable, so you stepped into the arena seeking to save everything for her sake... I still have photos from that time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]That was such a long time ago. Not even I kept that photo.
[name="Zofia"]But yeah. Margaret went far, far, away. Młynar didn't want to become a knight, preferring to wear a tie and sit in a cubicle, so I had to step up and make something happen.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]Just for the Nearl family?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]Of course not. After being bathed in the Radiant Knight's light, how could I not let it touch my heart? Of course I wanted to pierce the darkness covering Kazimierz with my own strength, sword in hand.

[name="Immature Reporter"]This is a photo of your last fight. Ever since your defeat to Fissure in the round of 16, you were never seen in the arena again.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]My left hand was injured.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5",focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]Gee, thanks for reminding me. I'm sure I would've forgotten all about it!
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]Sorry, I shouldn't have brought it up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]It's fine. Getting injured was only part of the reason I decided to retire. There were some things buried too deeply for me to think about back then.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]But when I look back at it now, more and more I think it was the disillusionment. Though I'd already expected it to some extent, once I was fully exposed to the filth beneath the glamor of knightsports, I really couldn't find a reason to keep going.
[name="Zofia"]Not everyone has the never-ending light to dispel the darkness wherever they go, like the Radiant Knight.
[name="Zofia"]Most fall right there, on the cusp before daybreak. Even if they point their swords to the sky, they can only swing at the infinite darkness.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]But you were still willing to be Maria Nearl's coach and help her shine in the arena.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]All I did was teach her how to survive in the darkness.
[name="Zofia"]I couldn't teach her anything I didn't know how to do myself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]What do you mean?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]I mean she managed that on her own.
[name="Zofia"]Be it with Maria or Margaret... There was nothing I could do.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]At least... they were able to bring you joy with what they accomplished. Like you said in 'Sports Afternoon,' you're proud of them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]You're right, I am. The Four Seasons Times echoed a similar sentiment in that one article, 'the Nearl Family's Best Attendant.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]...That was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"](*Shakes head*) Haha, don't worry. I didn't take it personally.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]But that's not what the look on your face said. I saw you at the newsstand that day, and your expression was different from usual.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]Okay, now this is getting creepy... How long have you been stalking me, kiddo?

[name="Immature Reporter"]I've been taking photos for the last few months, but I've been following you for the last six years and twenty-eight days.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]...Okay, you're definitely going to land yourself in jail one day.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]Sure, but I'll also land myself the greatest honor a reporter can get.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]......
[name="Zofia"]Suit yourself, doesn't matter at this point. Let's get back on topic.
[name="Zofia"]The moment I saw that photo, some things clicked in my head that I wasn't sure of before.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]I'll admit it, I was jealous of Margaret, but I'm not sure whether it was her combat prowess, her Originium Arts, her being a Pegasus, or the 'Nearl' name.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]None of those things matter. You wouldn't envy the Radiant Knight over little things like that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]Yeah.
[name="Zofia"]I guess I was just sad that I couldn't be like her, charging towards a goal from start to finish. Without hesitation, fearing neither hardship nor darkness.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]...You've never thought about stepping back into the arena?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]I'd rather die.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]So... do you miss your competitive days?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]Hmm...
[name="Zofia"]At least I knew what I wanted back then.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Immature Reporter"]...May I write an article and publish what you just said?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]Knock yourself out. I don't care, and the people I care about don't care either.

When she sees the familiar figure, the reporter perks up, raising her camera and pointing it at the woman across the street.
In her right hand is a freshly-bought cup of coffee, wispy steam coming off the rim of the cup.
When she gets to her car, she moves the cup from her right hand to her left and tries to grab the keys from her purse. Her left hand is impaired, and the coffee is very hot, so she can only hold it from an awkward position.
Upon seeing her distress, passersby try to help her on multiple occasions, but each time she refuses.
Seeing the woman grit her teeth in pain and rummage through her purse for her keys, the reporter cannot help but squeeze her camera tightly.
The look on her face reminds her of the videos she had seen, where this woman fought against all sorts of powerful enemies with a similar expression.
After a painstaking amount of time, the woman finally manages to wrestle the ring of keys from her purse.
