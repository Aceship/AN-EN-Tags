The investigation into the fire the other day has wrapped up. It was started by a worn-out home-use Originium fire starter device, which set off a chain of explosions. The residents had too many things strewn around the building, which helped the fire spread.

Shaw's Work Log
Jan 16 \ Overcast
Today's the last day of my vacation. I did something really embarrassing.
In the end, I couldn't find anything about the man. I don't know what to do to pull myself together, but I still have more important work.
Jan 17 \ Clear
Today's my first day back on the job.
I've fallen behind on my training, so I gotta catch up. I might've caught a cold, and I need to get better!
