Elena looks around the laboratory one last time. In the end, her eyes land on the alarm system.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_135_halo_1#3$1")]
[name="Elena"]'If it were me, I would've pulled the alarm a little later...' huh...?

Elena shakes her head.

The sound of Ferdinand's footsteps disappears down the hallway.

There are two documents sitting on the desk that she had cleaned out.
Elena picks them up. The one on top is the report of the experiment's data that she fought so hard for.

[name="Elena"]Too bad, the experiment's materials were destroyed. If I ever get the chance, maybe I'll try to reproduce it. Not sure if my next company will have Rhine's resources, though...

She cheerfully falls on the backpack that she packed, and kicks her legs in the air as she repeatedly confirms the document's details.
When her breathing finally stabilizes once more, she carefully puts away the confirmation. She brushes the hair feathers that she messed up during her bout of excitement, sits back down, and opens her backpack.
