When Magallan was little, there was a small flower shop on the corner near her home. She liked to visit.
Children would often buy flowers there, and ask the aging owner all sorts of questions.
Magallan enjoyed a song that the old man sang.
[name="Limping Old Man"]In an endless snowfield—ah! There's the bloom of a nameless flower♪
[name="Limping Old Man"]And my friend a-lies there, oh, and a-watches the snow come down♪
[name="Little Girl"]What does it mean? Is there really a place outside Columbia where hot water turns to ice as soon as you pour it out?
[name="Little Girl"]Have you been to any other special places?
[name="Limping Old Man"]Oh, you're interested, are you?
[name="Limping Old Man"]That would be another story altogether.

Magallan has seen countless records. The dreams people have about the icefields come in many different forms: wealth, knowledge, power... but all she cares about is her childhood dream, the story of the song.
Beneath their feet, the icefield is no longer infinite and boundless, but a conquest made one step at a time.
Still, the end is nowhere in sight. It is hidden away in the snow, and anyone on the snow is at the mercy of the avalanches.

Magallan starts digging at the snow and ice, first with her gloved hands, then with a shovel, then with her hands again.
Slowly, a frozen body emerges from beneath the snow, then another, and another. Asbestos joins in to help, and they excavate four bodies, laying them side-by-side on the snow.
