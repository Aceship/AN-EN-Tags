B.I.G. and Twista don't stop. Instead, they climb straight onto the highest point of the stage and stand up against the wind.

Dozens, hundreds, or perhaps even thousands of Metal Crabs, big and small, suddenly rush into the area, all brandishing sharp claws glinting under the light.
At the highest point of the stage, the crabs lower their upraised claws and turn around to signal to Beanstalk below the stage.
The Reproba girl gets the gist, hops onto a box by her side, and starts yelling out towards the wilderness.
