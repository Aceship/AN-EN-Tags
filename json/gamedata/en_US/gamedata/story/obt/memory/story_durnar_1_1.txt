[name="Dur-nar"]You know, when you guys first got here, you'd be dead on the ground after just an hour or so.
[name="Dur-nar"]Look at you now. None of you are even winded.
[name="Dur-nar"]Just goes to show that the training did its job.
[character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]Hehe, thanks, Instructor.
[character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]Beagle, the instructor hasn't finished yet! How could you—
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1")]
[name="Dur-nar"]It's fine, Fang. I'm not Dobermann. No need to follow the rules to a tee.
[name="Dur-nar"]Everyone's exhausted after all that training. Let's take it easy. Okay?
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=30, ystrength=30, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]Instructor!
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1")]
[name="Dur-nar"]You know, you're starting to sound more and more like Dobermann.
[character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]Right! —Wait, am I?
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1")]
[name="Dur-nar"]Look at you. If you stand up straight, put your hands on your hips, and stare straight into my eyes, it's like you're the spitting image of Dobermann.
[name="Dur-nar"]And the way you talk... I guess I needn't say anymore.
[character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_124_kroos_1",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]Oh...
[character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_124_kroos_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kroos"]She's right. You're exactly like her~
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1")]
[name="Dur-nar"]It's a good thing, though.
[name="Dur-nar"]It's not like back when I was in the army. Rhodes Island has a decent team of instructors who provide all reserve operators adequate training, and each of them has their specialty.
[name="Dur-nar"]Anything that I miss, they'll notice and give you guys a lesson on that, and vice versa.
[name="Dur-nar"]That way, rather than leaving our reserve operators' lessons to the whim of some random person, you all receive fairly comprehensive training.
[name="Dur-nar"]Grace, Fallon, Dobermann, and all the rest.
[name="Dur-nar"]You can always count on them to teach you what you need to know, and have your back in a fight.
[name="Dur-nar"]Fang.
[character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]Instructor!
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1")]
[name="Dur-nar"]Do your best to learn everything you can from Dobermann, okay? We wouldn't mind having a TA.
[character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]Of course, Instructor. Thank you, Instructor!
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1")]
[name="Dur-nar"]Also, remind me to find the groundskeeper to fix this place up after we're done training.
[name="Dur-nar"]I forgot to do it before, and Dobermann tore me a new one each and every time. *Sigh*...
[name="Dur-nar"]Okay, Fang? Be sure to remind me.
[character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]Yes, Instructor!
[character(name="char_260_durnar_1")]
[name="Dur-nar"]Thanks.
[name="Dur-nar"]Okay, enough chit-chat.

[name="Beagle"]Last time, she set her shield down and bludgeoned me with two swords for a whole hour!
[name="Beagle"]And she was as fast as the wind!
[character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]Oh, yeah...
[name="Fang"]I used to think of her as a really friendly person. She doesn't yell at us that much, and she treats us to some really tasty food.
[name="Fang"]It wasn't until I fought her for the first time that I found out... Once she starts walloping you, Instructor Dur-nar can be much worse than Instructor Dobermann. I could barely hold my lance up.
[name="Fang"]And you've seen her shield arm, right? When she drops the shield and picks up a sword, she can really strike like lightning.
[character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_121_lava_1",focus=1)]

[name="Dur-nar"]Man, during the break, I suddenly remembered a combat technique I used back in the day. I really want to try it out on someone.
[name="Dur-nar"]Oh, of course, I'll be using the same stuff as all of you. Regular training equipment, not those electric swords I modified.
[name="Dur-nar"]You'd better take it serious. Just because I'm not usually that hard on you guys doesn't mean I'll go easy when we're doing this for real.

[name="Dobermann"]Perfect timing. You manage the training grounds here, right?
[character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]Y-Yes, Instructor Dobermann. What's the matter?
[character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Dobermann"]Looks like Dur-nar and her team wrecked some of the equipment and obstacles while they were using this place. My guess is they had a pretty intense sparring match.
[name="Dobermann"]Help me fix it up. I'll be training with some reserve operators later tonight.
[character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]Yes, of course. Right away.
[character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Dobermann"]Thanks.
