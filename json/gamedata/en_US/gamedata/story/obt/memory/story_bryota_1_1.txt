With great anticipation, the youth opens the cardboard box sent from afar.
Wrapped up in layers of old newspapers is a little straw doll made from dried vines.

A sudden gust of wind blows by, and the straw man's limbs flop around like reeds.
Its hat of leaves also blows right off, revealing a bald head underneath.

A few regulars lift the entryway's curtains, and the mother invites them to take a seat before the sound of ice cubes dancing in the shaker fills the room.
The laughter of his young siblings reaches his ears. For a moment, it's as if he is whisked away to the beach, back to the little store of his childhood.
The young man looks towards the end of Fashion Street, and before he knows it, the setting sun's afterglow has already composed the score for a perfectly ordinary night.
