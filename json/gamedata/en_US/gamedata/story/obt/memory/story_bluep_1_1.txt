[name="Blue Poison"]This is the most enjoyable moment in baking. Watching the batter slowly turn golden and puff up in the oven, until it turns into a soft, fluffy cake...
[name="Blue Poison"]Desserts taste best when you let your imagination run wild, Glau.

[Character(name="avgnew_129_bluep_1#1$1",name2="avg_326_glacus_1",focus=1)]
[name="Blue Poison"]Hm... It's a new formula. Fresh cream mixed with a jam made from various kinds of berries. That gives it a sort of tropical flavor.
[Character(name="avgnew_129_bluep_1#1$1",name2="avg_326_glacus_1",focus=2)]
[name="Glaucus"]Sure, but its color is as terrifying as ever. Your fashion sense is pretty decent, so how the heck did your sense for food aesthetics end up downright rotten?

[name="Blue Poison"]Don't say that. I'm not being ostracized or anything. I'm actually very happy with my life here.
[name="Blue Poison"]But the best way to get along with something 'toxic' is to stay away from it. I know that, you know that, everyone knows that.

The Kerthun Valley is situated in a vast rainforest within Sargon's borders. Since time immemorial, it has never been under the direct control of the Sargonian lords ameer.
This was the most important factor in Rhodes Island's decision to build a safe house there.
There are many reasons for its unique geopolitical position. Data show that the area is abundant with natural resources, and many lords ameer have tried to expand their influence into the region.
Yet their efforts were all in vain.

[Character(name="avgnew_129_bluep_1#1$1",name2="avg_326_glacus_1",focus=2)]
[name="Glaucus"]The specific reasons require further investigation, but according to a local guide, it very likely has to do with the indigenous people.
[name="Glaucus"]Those natives are also the biggest variable in our mission. The guide said they aren't too hard to get along with, but also warned that they possess a terrifying ability.
[name="Glaucus"]We only have vague descriptions of the phenomenon in question, but based on our analysis, their ability might be an application of some kind of toxic chemical compound...
