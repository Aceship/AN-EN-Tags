[Character(name="avg_npc_145",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Then that should be a problem with the system.
[name="Mayer"]You said it yourself. You reboot often, right?

[name="Mayer"]So those parts were for you, huh?
[name="Mayer"]I visited that dungeon of hers yesterday. She was working for the better part of the day.
[name="Mayer"]She said it was some kind of “advanced component used in extreme circumstances to be installed on a high-end mobile photography platform.”
[name="Mayer"]So she meant you, huh?
[name="Mayer"]Well, this is perfect. Let's go pay Closure a visit now. We'll take care of this problem of yours.
[name="Mayer"]That way, you won't find yourself freezing up or having to install OS updates while you're out on a mission.

[Character(name="char_123_fang_1", name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]Yeah.
[name="Fang"]I wasn't trying to reprimand her, you know.
[name="Fang"]If she really wants to take a break, all she has to do is tell me. I'm not going to say no.
[name="Fang"]It's just the way she goes about makes me kinda upset sometimes.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1", name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=2)]
[name="Beagle"]Kroos is too shy to actually say it. She's actually really thoughtful.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1", name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]I kind of think she's just toying with me.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1", name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=2)]
[name="Beagle"]Well, she's really close with you.

[name="Fang"]*Sigh*... I'd rather she treated me a little more normal...
[name="Fang"]Let's go to bed. We have training first thing tomorrow morning.
[name="Fang"]Be sure to wake Kroos up. She looked pretty tired when she got back. She just might not get up on her own.
[name="Fang"]If she oversleeps, Instructor Dobermann...
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1", name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=2)]
