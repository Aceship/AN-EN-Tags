The Liberi's hands, soft and agile yet covered in thin calluses from years of handling lab equipment, slide down from her hair and caress her now pointy chin.
For as far back as Ifrit can remember, Silence has very rarely been so intimate.
Silence would usually only lightly touch her skin as though she was frighteningly fragile.
There were a couple times when she got so sick that she couldn't tell any faces apart, but she could clearly feel a pair of hands like these touching her.
The hands seemed to be trembling, but they immediately offered Ifrit the support she needed and made her feel at ease.

[Delay(time=1)]  
Now, these hands first lightly brush her face, before firmly holding her shoulders. She tries her best to stand up straight, hoping to make herself seem a little more dependable.
The Liberi breathes a sigh and says:

Silence did not finish her sentence before she left.
Ifrit can only guess at her intent. What did Silence want to tell her? What exactly did she want for her?
Did she want her to help with something? Did she have a mission for her? Or did she just want her to be a good girl so she wouldn't have to worry during her trip?
Ifrit keeps wondering over and over, and a part of her thinks that, just maybe, Silence was only hoping she would be safe.

[Dialog]
[delay(time=1)]
Silence's attitude toward her is completely different from Saria's.
Saria might expect her to grow up to become a woman who can stand on her own, while Silence has only ever wanted her to live a peaceful life.
Silence said she's gotten taller, grown up.
Ifrit knows that even if she feels powerful and indomitable, she actually hasn't grown up to the point that Silence would change her mind and think of her as dependable.

[Dialog]

Not yet.

She still has a long path to walk, even if there isn't much time left.

Ifrit was once unable to control the flames burning in her heart.
She once swore she would control them one day, in order to keep those she loves from harm.
When Saria apologized, she opened her eyes with difficulty.
A shining blade, bright as snow, was mere inches from her, but it was the sadness teeming in Saria's eyes that she found far sharper.
Ifrit did not want to see such a sight ever again. She decided she would do what it takes to ensure Saria and Silence never look that way again.
She is no longer powerless as she was.
Now, she can do it.

[name="Ifrit"]Sheesh, I get it!
[name="Ifrit"]Silence told me what she's doing... I'm not gonna give Silence or Saria any trouble.

[name="Ifrit"]'Ifrit, help us!'
[name="Ifrit"]Hehe, I can't wait to hear that!
