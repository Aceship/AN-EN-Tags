[name="Podenco"]Mm-hm. We were living off the land ever since I can remember, not that we had a choice. People barely ever wanted to see what it was like outside. They said it was a mess out there.
[name="Podenco"]We planted so many crops. At first it was millet, then at some point the adults pulled all the millet out while it was still sprouts, and switched to coffee beans.
[Character(name="avg_258_podego_1#9$1",name2="avg_181_flower_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Perfumer"]'Bolívarian coffee.' Not just any bean can lay claim to a whole country's name. The largest cities sell it as a popular souvenir, and the demand is endless both domestic and abroad.
[name="Perfumer"]And so, though masses of its people go hungry, Bolívar still has all sorts of regional policies in place to encourage the growing of cash crops.

[name="Podenco"]It was completely new to us, so we didn't have experience growing it. And the soil is hard in the plateau, and the drainage is poor. It wasn't good for growing coffee at all.
[name="Podenco"]All the land in our village was used to plant it, but the harvests were miserable, the beans didn't meet the standard, and the reward wasn't enough to trade for the grains we used to grow.

[Character(name="avg_258_podego_1#2$1",name2="avg_181_flower_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Podenco"]But that didn't work either. Every harvest season, we'd get people coming to levy our grains. I couldn't tell you if they were from the Singas dynasty, the Coalition, or True Bolívarians.
[name="Podenco"]Or maybe they were just a bunch of awful people who wandered around the border plateau.
[name="Podenco"]We could escape Catastrophe, but we couldn't escape them. Our only real option was to develop the wild land and plant more grains.

The yarny velvets have been air-drying naturally for two days. I think they should be good now.
First, trim away the stems and leaves that are already damaged.
Then apply the desiccant. It's the trickiest but the most important step. Too thin a coating and it won't preserve for long, too thick and it'll completely block their scent.

Lena pushes the door open.

She opens it up, and inside are boronia teabags and a box of cookies.

[name="Blue Poison"]I hear she gave HR a whole stack of office paper, too, dyed in all different colors with flower extract.
[name="Blue Poison"]I want to find her and tell her how delicious the cookies were!
[name="Blue Poison"]Gold chrysanthemum stamens, chopped up evenly throughout the dough. Baked with care to not only not ruin the texture, but let the fragrance make them that much more appetizing.
