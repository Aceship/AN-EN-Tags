[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   I digress, but there's one thing I definitely haven't told you.
[name="Warfarin"]   The truth is, it doesn't matter how much you like doing something. If you keep doing it for a hundred years, you're bound to get tired of it. Most Vampires are sick of fighting for exactly that reason.
[name="Warfarin"]   But at the same time, a century of doing the same thing also eventually turns it into a habit. And when everyone in your tribe has this habit, it becomes the tribe's social norm.
[name="Warfarin"]   In other words, it's a social norm for us Vampires to thirst for blood and war.
[name="Warfarin"]   And, to this day, I still haven't overcome my 'social norm.'
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   But you haven't ever had any real accidents on the ship.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   Of course not. I've trained myself for two whole centuries. The stuff you see me pulling is just a pastime of mine.

[name="Warfarin"]   Don't look at me like that. I'll admit, I do lose control when I'm with the Doctor.
[name="Warfarin"]   But about that, I've actually come up with a few new ideas ever since we started getting all this new blood on the ship. Still need some tinkering, though...
[name="Warfarin"]   Uh, let's shelve that topic for now. Anyway, the reason I became a doctor is a simple one. I got tired of war. I got sick of it.
[name="Warfarin"]   And I chose to reject the Vampire social norm, and while I looked for a way to overcome my instincts, I inevitably became a medical researcher.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]

[name="Warfarin"]   I wrote for this magazine at the time, and then, one day, some dipshit showed up to write a long article supposedly poking holes in all my theories.
[name="Warfarin"]   The key thing here is that I wasn't wrong, but all the things she pointed out were indeed issues that I neglected or didn't consider.

[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   Ah, fine, fine. I get it. Ask away.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   Why did you join Rhodes Island, Dr. Warfarin?
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   Why, to research medicine and save lives.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   But Rhodes Island back then isn't anything like the Rhodes Island of today. At the time we were entirely focused on getting out of Kazdel. So why did you accept Dr. Kal'tsit's request?

[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   Physically, there's not much wrong with her, but her mental condition is a bit tricky, most likely because she's the King.
[name="Warfarin"]   She talks in her sleep, she unconsciously reads the emotions of others, and she has trouble controlling her powers. A normal doctor probably wouldn't know where to begin with her.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   That's why I came to you.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   And I thought you'd at least stay and help take care of the kid, but you ended up just dumping her on me.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Rhodes Island's command has fallen into chaos after losing both Theresa and the Doctor. There are plenty of eyes trying to snoop on us too. I have to take charge and maintain order.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   And given the circumstances, you made the journey all the way here to bring the new King of Sarkaz to me.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#6$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   This is the King, Kal'tsit.
[name="Warfarin"]   Theresa's a cruel one. How could she pick a fragile little girl like her to be her successor?
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#6$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   But Amiya is the last bit of hope she had left.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#5$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   Hope is a poison to the Sarkaz.
[name="Warfarin"]   I've heard much about your past deeds. Now that you have the living King of Sarkaz here with you, surely you've run a few ideas through your head?
[name="Warfarin"]   Perhaps I should let the girl die painlessly in her sleep. It's a better fate than the pain and hardship she is destined to suffer.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#5$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   This isn't how I wished for things to turn out either. If only it could've been another way.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#5$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   But now that things have come to this, as a doctor, I just don't want to see another soul extinguish before my eyes.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#6$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   As a doctor? Giving yourself a pat on the back now, aren't you? You may be a doctor, but you're also a conspirator, a cold-blooded puppetmaster, and an accessory to a war.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#6$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   I won't deny that, but what about you, Warfarin?
[name="Kal'tsit"]   You've refused to serve each and every Royal Court. You chose to stay away from war and hide in a border town, refusing to treat anyone but the locals. The name 'Mr. Blood' has long been known far and wide across Victorian and Columbian medical circles.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   You'd rather be an outlier among the Vampires. Can someone like you really save all those trying to escape from war?

[name="Kal'tsit"]   Oh?
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#5$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   You told me everything about your current situation, you brought the new King of Sarkaz here for treatment, and you act like you're the losers in this conflict. It's almost like you're trying to say you have nothing to do with this war anymore.
[name="Warfarin"]   You're trying to rope me in.
[name="Warfarin"]   And my response is still the same as all those years ago. Not happening.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#5$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   ......
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#5$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Theresa's ideals have always been about more than just the Sarkaz.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   She set her sights far, and she had grand ambitions, but that was exactly why things turned out the way they did.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#5$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   Everyone who starts a war has some wonderful ideals to circulate around.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#5$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   She wanted to cure Oripathy.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#5$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   Now this is the first time I ever heard about that.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#5$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   And we've already put the fundamentals of the research together.

[name="Warfarin"]   Your handiwork?
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#10$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Naturally.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#10$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   ......
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#10$1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   I won't deny it. At some point in time, Rhodes Island will take action, because of Theresis.

[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   Don't get the wrong idea. I didn't accept there and then. I've heard plenty of pompous big talk in my lifetime. It takes more than that to persuade me.
[name="Warfarin"]   But, when she came to take you away the next day, she said she'd already spread the word that Mad Doctor Warfarin had joined Rhodes Island. It was too late for me to turn her down.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#6$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   I was pissed. I'd been on the run for centuries, hiding from the Royal Court, and that was all it took?
[name="Warfarin"]   She even had Mon3tr 'invite' and escort me to Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#6$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   Er...
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   Tell you the truth, I didn't believe her when she said she and Theresa wanted to cure Oripathy. It wasn't until she showed me the relevant research that I was convinced, albeit only barely.

[name="Warfarin"]   Why would I leave, then?
[name="Warfarin"]   I'm telling you all this today because Londinium is a big step and a new journey to you.
[name="Warfarin"]   As your attending physician, I should prepare a gift for you.

[name="Warfarin"]   I don't think I've talked to anyone about this for some hundred years. It's only when I speak to Kal'tsit that I sometimes get the urge to discuss this.
[name="Warfarin"]   She knows just about everything, though, and a lot of it she doesn't actually need me to point out.
[name="Warfarin"]   But, anyway, since I already started, let me go into it a little more.

[name="Warfarin"]   They know what it is they are doing. That's exactly why they're able to eliminate their enemies and spill rivers of blood without thinking twice.
[name="Warfarin"]   And once they've accomplished their goals and built their new order, they're overthrown by the next one with an ambitious goal.

[name="Warfarin"]   Oh well. There's one more thing I need to make clear.
[name="Warfarin"]   Kal'tsit's right. I don't loathe war, per se.
[name="Warfarin"]   I went into hiding when I decided to leave war and the Royal Court behind, and after I became a doctor, I made a rule for myself: Never treat anyone who has anything to do with warfare.
[name="Warfarin"]   But if I truly loathed it, I should've strived to end war myself. I should have thrown myself into its midst like all those with ambitions.
[name="Warfarin"]   I have nothing against the idea. I simply don't believe that line of thinking will lead us anywhere.
[name="Warfarin"]   Some might think my choice is a cowardly one, because I'm tolerating and turning a blind eye to war. I may save many lives, but I've also allowed plenty more deaths to occur by inaction.
[name="Warfarin"]   To use a more scientific way to describe it, war is an endless internal friction. There are better ways to lead us toward the future.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#2$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   By the way, I stole that sentence from a book. Sounds cool, doesn't it? Maybe you should give it a read.
[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#2$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#3",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_171_bldsk_1#1$1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]   Oh, right. Another thing—
[name="Warfarin"]   There's a reason I chose not to become an elite operator. I know there will come a day when the path before you will be devastated by the flames of war.
[name="Warfarin"]   That's the hill I'm going to die on, and I'm not going to change my mind for anyone.
[name="Warfarin"]   So if you think I'm mad or disappointed, you're not quite right.
[name="Warfarin"]   Because I never had any expectations to begin with.
[name="Warfarin"]   But I built Rhodes Island's blood bank with my own hands. I watched Rhodes Island's medical team grow from a few heads to the organization it is. I watched Rhodes Island grow into a pharmaceutical company.
[name="Warfarin"]   As long as I am confident that both you and Kal'tsit haven't abandoned your quest to overcome Oripathy...
[name="Warfarin"]   I will stay at Rhodes Island, treating the patients here.
