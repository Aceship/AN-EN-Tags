Seeing that he's in a bit of a pinch, she quickly strides forward without a second thought.

As soon as those words leave her mouth, it suddenly dawns on her – is it really a good idea to leave him alone after he was just attacked? An Infected person, at that.
The old Wild Mane Knight would never have considered this: all she'd ever wanted was to charge at her enemies lance-first. But now, things were different. Now she's Wild Mane of the Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub.
But if she let the assassins get away, wouldn't that endanger both herself and Mr. Kalisz?
Right at that moment, she sees someone pass by the entrance to the alley.

Marsov stands up stiffly and heads out the door.

Iwona thinks back to how he had acted from beginning to end.
Which one was the real Marsov?
He was willing to stand up for the safety of the Infected, and even to drink with an Infected knight he had only just met.
Yet, he also stomped on the card symbolizing her knightclub. He lied that she had stalked him, and belittled the competition knights by saying they were only good for entertainment.
He...
