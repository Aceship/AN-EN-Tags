[name="Glaucus"]When you wield it, you just need to lift the weapon to the right height, and the sensor module on your upper arm will be able to detect your muscles' movements.

[name="Millais"]However, I find that your work habits and the direction of your research are somewhat different from what we have in mind.
[name="Millais"]For example, you insist on spending much of your energy on tuning and personalizing equipment, and it's reflected in your designs.
[name="Millais"]You customize your modules to the user's needs. This introduces complexities to the design, but the issues they are intended to address may very well be ones that the user could have gotten used to over time.
[name="Millais"]To tell you the truth, I don't think that's a bad thing, but when you design based around that logic, the additional costs don't result in additional profits. Furthermore, such designs cannot be produced on the assembly line.
[name="Millais"]In the end, Raythean Industries is a large corporation, and we aren't lacking in geniuses here.

[name="Professor's Assistant"]After the incident, he left Dakfung Security and used one of the fake identities he used as a mercenary to apply to become a janitor at our division.
[name="Professor's Assistant"]He'd been planning this for a very long time. He was going to commit suicide during our media day, and lay all the blame on our company.
[name="Professor's Assistant"]Since we outsourced janitorial work to a service company, we didn't discover his plan in time. This oversight is our security department's responsibility, and we'll make sure that they take the necessary precautions going forward.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_523_1#1$1")]
[name="Millais"]Necessary precautions... If it weren't for that candidate modifying his weapon, I would've been killed!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_223")]
[name="Professor's Assistant"]I'm truly sorry!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_523_1#1$1")]
[name="Millais"]Never mind... Did you bring the report regarding the mission he was on?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_223")]
[name="Professor's Assistant"]Here it is.

[name="Millais"]Did the 'Navigator Mk. I' really malfunction...?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_223")]
[name="Professor's Assistant"]Based on the operational logs we exported from the unit, it seems... it was working as intended.
[name="Professor's Assistant"]And Dakfung Security's internal investigation report shows that the real reason behind that incident was that the mercenary subconsciously wanted to pull the trigger...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_523_1#1$1")]
[name="Millais"]...and failed.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_223")]
[name="Professor's Assistant"]It's a good thing he didn't get his way. I mean, I knew there could never be a problem with your design.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_523_1#1$1")]
[name="Millais"]......
[name="Millais"]No.
[name="Millais"]Announce to the public that his weapon malfunctioned and caused the accident. That we sincerely regret this and will take full responsibility.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_223")]
[name="Professor's Assistant"]What? Professor!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_523_1#1$1")]
[name="Millais"]Now leave, and do as I said. I'll pay for any compensation out of my own pocket.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_223")]
[name="Professor's Assistant"]Understood.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_523_1#1$1")]
[name="Millais"]Of course, I also wanted to talk to you about the new candidate, Glaucus. Didn't you contact me because of her?
[name="Millais"]She may have saved my life, but my judgment is still that she's not fit to be an equipment designer.
[name="Millais"]Her design philosophy simply can't develop the sort of products that could expand our company or increase our profit margins.
[Dialog]
[charslot]
[name="???"]I know.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_523_1#1$1")]
[name="Millais"]But she is indeed a genius, and your headquarters can't let talents like her slip by.

[charslot]
[name="???"]I will send someone to sign a cooperation agreement with her and sign her on as a advanced weapon evaluator. She will be in charge of tuning the latest weapons, and all the company's most innovative research will be made available to her.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_523_1#1$1")]
[name="Millais"]Good. That's a much better position for her.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_523_1#1$1")]
[name="Millais"]Right. I wonder how I turned out the way I am now.
[name="Millais"]When I interviewed Glaucus, I asked her the same question. How she sees the relationship between technology and people.
[name="Millais"]And her answer was...
[name="Millais"]'Technology may have forged my legs, but it's only when I run that they have meaning.'
