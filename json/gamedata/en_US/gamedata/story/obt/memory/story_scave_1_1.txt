[name="Scavenger"]Reporting in.
[name="Scavenger"]Day... seven.
[name="Scavenger"]More deceased got disposed of this morning. Likely extreme Originium particulate density in the building. Conditions for the Infected are turning south fast.
[name="Scavenger"]For the past 24 hours, haven't seen any workers in any area not covered by walls, let alone leaving the factory.
[name="Scavenger"]Comms pick up heavy interference when I get even slightly closer.
[name="Scavenger"]High-voltage network all around outside. No way to locate the control room for now.
[name="Scavenger"]Got the exterior patrol shifts and movement patterns down. Can't work out the guards inside yet.
[name="Scavenger"]I want to get this crap over with. If you give the go, I can take the most violent option.
[name="Scavenger"]Hmph... Fine, Rhodes Island does things its own way. Copy.
[name="Scavenger"]Plan B? The factory's waste transporter goes down to the basement every morning at three. They stop running the sewer pipes in the meantime.
[name="Scavenger"]Simple enough to get through, as long as I get a gas mask.
[name="Scavenger"]I'm only responsible for paralyzing the security systems here, anyway. Not my job to provide followup support or guidance, right?
[name="Scavenger"]...I know. I can do this less cleanly, if it comes to it. Figured that's why you called me for this in the first place.

[character(name="avg_npc_194")]
[name="Tulio"]*Sigh* I'm serious, I turned a new leaf since all those years ago. Look, I'm Infected now too. I've been through hella shit, I... I understand you.
[name="Tulio"]You've seen this factory up close. You know how things are here, right?
[name="Tulio"]They call me a guard, but I'm still just as much a prisoner as anyone else. We're all just as damned here.
[character(name="avg_149_scave_1$1")]
[name="Scavenger"]Okay, but you're their overseer.
[character(name="avg_npc_194")]

[name="Tulio"]There're two watchhound cores monitoring the whole factory at the same time. Throwing the master breaker to cut the surveillance won't get you anywhere either; they'll switch to emergency power, fast.
[name="Tulio"]You need someone to work with you, and obviously I need someone to help me out. So no matter how much you distrust me, working together's still our best bet.

[character(name="avg_npc_194")]
[name="Tulio"]Alright... so you're agreeing to work together, then? Is that what you mean?
[name="Tulio"]I know what you're planning, Scavenger. I'm not gonna tell you every route straight away.
[name="Tulio"]Follow me, and keep to the foot of the wall. I've figured out the blind spots.
[character(name="avg_149_scave_1$1")]
[name="Scavenger"]Is the factory foreman in?
[character(name="avg_npc_194")]
[name="Tulio"]He's not. Why would he be? It's three in the morning.
[name="Tulio"]He only shows up occasionally. What kinda healthy guy would wanna live in a place where the air's filled with Originium?
[character(name="avg_149_scave_1$1")]
[name="Scavenger"]So everyone here's Infected?
[character(name="avg_npc_194")]
[name="Tulio"]Yeah. Not a problem for you, right? You're already Infected, what's a couple more rocks gonna do?
[name="Tulio"]What about the rest of your crew? I figure they all got their protection on?
[name="Tulio"]What're you guys after, anyway? There's nothing valuable here, and we don't exactly make high-precision Originium products. Seriously can't figure out why anyone'd rob this place.
[name="Tulio"]...Don't feel like answering, huh? You weren't this hard to talk to back when we used to do business.
[name="Tulio"]Although I guess you wouldn't have cut it as a merc if you were the same as before.
[character(name="avg_149_scave_1$1")]
[name="Scavenger"]Don't waste your breath. Never wanted to work with a piece of shit like you, anyway.
[character(name="avg_npc_194")]
[name="Tulio"]Tch...
[name="Tulio"]But we've got no choice for now. We have to split ways from here.
[name="Tulio"]Surveillance core's right over there, through the workshop.
[character(name="avg_149_scave_1$1")]
[name="Scavenger"]Then we each make our move in ten minutes. I'll find you after. Once we RDV, we head to the master control room and take out the whole system.
