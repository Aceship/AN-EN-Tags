[name="Field Operator B"]  A secret family recipe?
[Character(name="char_013_riop", name2="avgnew_126_shotst_1#3$1",focus=2)]
[name="Meteor"]  Nah, I lost my parents when I was very young. It was a village household by the mountains that helped me grow. They're all good and kind people.
[Character(name="char_013_riop", name2="avgnew_126_shotst_1#7$1",focus=2)]

[name="Meteor"]  Of course. It's not complicated.
[name="Meteor"]  You need spinach roots and wild gingerflax I just took the chance to dig up, the striped scalecis we caught this afternoon, and I used some pickled jerky and salt I brought along to season, then let it stew for fifteen minutes. Then you're good to go.
[Character(name="char_013_riop", name2="avgnew_126_shotst_1#7$1",focus=1)]

[name="Meteor"]  Phew. Though, if I could, adding a pinch of staricitron seeds would've made it even better. There's a little spicy kick to them. Drinking some hot meat soup peppered with them can really brush the cold away on days like these.

[name="Field Operator A"]  Don't ask, Gianna spent ages folding it. While you were out, Mina caught the little mite awake at night over and over, just folding roses.

[name="Meteor"]  I'm sorry, Gianna, for making you worry.

[name="Gianna"]  I don't want you to be sorry. Can you promise me you won't get hurt anymore? I get really scared I won't see you again.

[name="Meteor"]  I won't, Gianna, I won't.
