[name="Enciodes"]  Doctor, no doubt you already know that the Silverash clan's exploration of the outside world began with my ancestors—namely, my grandfather.
[name="Enciodes"]  As recounted in Kjerag folklore, he once went on an expedition with an adventurer, eventually returning with a wealth of silver and gold.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#2$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  While he did in fact spend over ten years away with an adventurer, in truth he returned with nothing of value.
[name="Enciodes"]  Only a few bits of literature, some tools that were considered advanced at the time, and blueprints.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#9$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  These trinkets would go on to greatly influence my father, Olafur, who became the first person in all of Kjerag to study abroad.
[name="Enciodes"]  He met my mother Elizabeth while studying in Victoria, where he also made connections among the nobility.
[name="Enciodes"]  It was then that Viscount Walden became friends with my father.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  When I stayed in the same city on my own trip abroad, I received some assistance from the Viscount. I also met his children—Carle and Kate.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#9$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  Carle was my age, and full of pride. While he saw me as a rival in all things, he was far from a bad person.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#2$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  However, I had the misfortune to learn that he was attacked and killed by Infected some time after we parted.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  After his death, Viscount Walden became more and more hateful towards the Infected, drafting a number of restrictions targeting them.

[name="Enciodes"]  Realistically, it all depends on the particular nobles running each city.

[name="Enciodes"]  Rest assured, Doctor. I shall personally ensure that Rhodes Island's reputation is upheld.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#10$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  Now, there's no need to be nervous. I've only received reports of your recent activities. I don't know what your plans actually are.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#9$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  But I surmise that connections with a powerful viscount can only work in your favor.
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  Regardless, Kate is the subject of our concern this time. She was kidnapped—by Infected.
[name="Enciodes"]  This is partly why the Viscount agreed to let me pass this on to you, despite his disgust towards the Infected.
[name="Enciodes"]  You see, he worries that his own actions may have provoked this, and as such he is willing to employ any means necessary.

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",fadetime=1,block=true)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The daughter of the Viscount of County Sykes was kidnapped by a group of Infected. They demand a ransom of 100,000 pounds within twenty days, or they will kill the hostage.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Viscount Walden hopes we will be able to find and rescue his daughter.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  He is well-known among the nobles of Western Victoria for having his eldest son was slain by the Infected a few years ago, as well as for the strict policies he's enforced on them since.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The laws and regulations the Infected are subject to in Sykes are more stringent than any other county.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  More importantly, Walden's surname is Caster.
[name="Dobermann"]  The Caster family is very influential in Western Victoria, and if we can form connections with them, it may save us a lot of trouble down the road.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But therein lies the problem.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Naturally, a noble so hostile to the Infected would not normally entrust this commission to us directly. And in fact, it was passed on through an intermediary.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That intermediary's name is Enciodes.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  A delicious cake, placed before us right when we're most hungry? I am skeptical, to say the least.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But I must admit that, ignoring whatever Enciodes might be scheming, this commission is still very tempting.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  I'm inclined to agree.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Rhodes Island has been making moves across the nomadic cities of Western Victoria, to find places we can stopover at.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Considering his renown among Victoria's nobility from his time studying abroad, it's hardly surprising that he would have noticed our movements.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If anything though, he is the one with more to lose from this interaction, yet he is the one who reached out to us.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  As such, I am forced to understand this as a sign of his trust in you. I can't think of another explanation.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  I must confess I had the same instinctive response, given what I saw of your operation report.

[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Naturally, I do not intend to pry into your relationships.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But I will simply remind you: as our cooperation with Karlan Trade is ongoing, we must be careful how we handle our relationship with Enciodes.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Admittedly, your trip to Kjerag has brought about some unexpected benefits.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But you should also understand that what we are about to do next is an exception, and I strongly recommend not getting tangled up with any Victoria-adjacent figures beyond a business capacity.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It is extremely dangerous—for both you and him.

[name="Caster Operator"]  Hardly. All it took was a little asking around, and some tracking in the slums.
[name="Caster Operator"]  But damn, this city really treats its Infected terribly. They're all miserable here.
[name="Caster Operator"]  By the look of it, the noble girl's kidnapping was carried out by the only relatively large group of Infected in the city.
[name="Caster Operator"]  Their security was pretty tight for amateurs, so I took some pictures of the surroundings first.
[name="Caster Operator"]  These are the pictures taken from around their holdout point.
[name="Caster Operator"]  And this is a picture I got of their boss.

[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  So what brings Enciodes, the illustrious president of Karlan Trade, to our humble abode?
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#9$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  As I recall, the last I saw you was at that ball eight years ago.
[name="Enciodes"]  How prideful you were back then, as the eldest son of Viscount Walden.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  Yet everyone's eyes were on you the moment you stepped out.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Tch. Damn and blast.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Listen up, Enciodes. I have no interest in waxing lyrical about my days as a noble. I've long since quit that game.
[name="Infected Brother"]  The only thing I care about right now is how you found this place. You and that enigmatic hooded person next to you. What are you trying to do with just the two of you?
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#2$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  I'd heard that you died during an Infected riot. Seems the situation was more complicated than that.

[name="Noble Sister"]  If father asked you to come, then please turn back...
[name="Noble Sister"]  I will not be going with you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_243",name2="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Enciodes"]  I assume you and Carle planned this kidnapping together, Kate?
[name="Enciodes"]  And if I'm not mistaken, you must have been the one to come up with the idea.
[Character(name="avg_npc_243",name2="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Noble Sister"]  Yes, you're right...
[name="Noble Sister"]  Carle's had a terrible time all these years since he became Infected. I've been trying to aid him and his friends in secret, but there's only so much I can do alone.
[Character(name="avg_npc_243",name2="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Enciodes"]  So you offered to let your brother kidnap you, in order to collect a ransom from your father.
[name="Enciodes"]  Viscount Walden loves you dearly, and will surely be devastated.
[Character(name="avg_npc_243",name2="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Noble Sister"]  I know... I don't want to make father sad either, but I just can't bear to see Carle suffer so.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  Shut your mouth, Kate!
[Character(name="avg_npc_243")]
[name="Noble Sister"]  I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought it up...
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  In any case, Enciodes, if you're here as the old man's mouthpiece, I'd recommend you leave, now.
[name="Infected Brother"]  And if you plan on taking Kate with you, you'll have to ask my brothers what they think of that.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  Calm down, you two. Although I did come at your father's request, I stand before you as myself.
[name="Enciodes"]  And next to me is my friend. 'Doctor' will suffice.
[name="Enciodes"]  I am here to help you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  Help, huh? Help, charity, handouts. Why not just use your favorite word? What was it again... Ah yes, a 'deal'.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  You're free to take it however you like.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  In your eyes, I might as well still be that blowhard of a noble who was always showing off.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Maybe if I were still that same man, I would have some chips to wager with you.
[name="Infected Brother"]  But now I have nothing.
[name="Infected Brother"]  You want to make a deal? What would you offer me? And what could I possibly give you?
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  That all depends on how this conversation goes.
[name="Enciodes"]  First of all, I can assure you that Viscount Walden will never know anything that happens here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  Hah... I can't remember the last time I had a serious talk with anyone other than Kate.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Even if it's coming from you of all people, I can't help but to think back to the old days.
[name="Infected Brother"]  At least let me thank you for showing me respect, in your own way. Not that I feel at all respected.
[name="Infected Brother"]  But I knew you couldn't help me the moment you waltzed in here, grand as anything, like the world was already in your hands.
[name="Infected Brother"]  You want to know why I'm alive? How my quarrel with the old man got to this point?
[name="Infected Brother"]  Fine, I'll tell you.
[name="Infected Brother"]  You completely stole the spotlight in that ball, and you wouldn't believe how much that upset me.
[name="Infected Brother"]  So I left the venue early that night, thinking that as long as you were in Sykes, I'd rather be anywhere but there with you.
[name="Infected Brother"]  And while my head was lost in the clouds, I accidentally ran over a woman.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Now, I'm no saint, but I wouldn't just do a hit-and-run, so I took her to the hospital.
[name="Infected Brother"]  But when we got there, I found out she was actually Infected, so no one would treat her.
[name="Infected Brother"]  The most hilarious part though? That the doctors were all so eager to help me, the Viscount's son, right up until they saw the Originium crystals on her skin and recoiled in horror.
[name="Infected Brother"]  I just couldn't understand at the time. I honestly could not wrap my head around it. I knew that having Oripathy was bad, but I never expected it to be THAT bad.
[name="Infected Brother"]  So my temper flared up and I brought her back home. Made our personal family doctor see to her.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Naturally, the old man was furious when he found out, but I pushed back against him.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  This all sounds vaguely familiar, but I was busy getting ready to move on to the next city at the time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  That's right, you bastard. You decided to just up and leave after making such a big splash. I don't even want to know how many girls' hearts you took with you.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Looking back though, I have no idea what came over me back then.
[name="Infected Brother"]  It's not like I wasn't scared of Oripathy, but I couldn't see what about it made everyone shit their pants like that.
[name="Infected Brother"]  But now I understand how terrifying it truly is. Some patients will straight up explode when they die.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Some don't, but their deaths are still very painful. Heh, better watch yourselves. Maybe I'll blow up too, and take the both of you out with me.

[name="Infected Brother"]  For the longest time, she thought I was planning to do something to her, but it was much simpler than that. I just wanted her to get better.
[name="Infected Brother"]  I was a complete idiot at the time. I'd push back against anyone that tried to go against me, no matter the reason.
[name="Infected Brother"]  The old man wanted to kick her out, so I insisted on keeping her. She thought she'd be a burden on me, so I wanted to look after her even more.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  You fell in love.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  Damn right I did. It's a story as old as time. A noble and a commoner fall in love, but the family will never approve. Finally, father and son turn against each other.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Only difference is, the commoner was Infected, and the father had a hand in tormenting her to death. So the noble infected himself as revenge against his father.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#4$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  I see. So that's the basis of both your 'death' as well as Viscount Walden's hatred of the Infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  Naturally. His son with a bright future fell in love with an Infected and turned against him. Unwilling to admit his own failures, who else could he blame but the Infected?
[name="Infected Brother"]  And... I was already the Infected he hated the most.
[name="Infected Brother"]  The news of my death wasn't a lie, Enciodes.
[name="Infected Brother"]  The man named Carle Caster died, seven years ago.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#9$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_008")]
[name="Infected Brother"]  Look, you have that expression on your face again.
[name="Infected Brother"]  What do you think is going to happen even if I do get the ransom?
[name="Infected Brother"]  I share the money with my brothers, then we move to another city and live out the rest of our lives in peace?
[name="Infected Brother"]  No, we'll still be turned away at every door, simply because we are Infected.
[name="Infected Brother"]  We'll still be looked down on. We'll still have stones thrown at us. We'll still be driven to suffer in the slums.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Even if we wanted to work, nobody would take us in. The only thing left for us would be to find a cozy little alley to die in.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Of course, the money wouldn't hurt. A few of us have already starved to death.
[name="Infected Brother"]  But how much would that money actually be worth?
[name="Infected Brother"]  After years of groveling, struggling to survive with my Infected brothers, I finally understand.
[name="Infected Brother"]  The Infected cannot survive.
[name="Infected Brother"]  I've heard of a group called Reunion that was uniting the Infected. And of an organization called Rhodes Island trying to save our lives.
[name="Infected Brother"]  Who knows when their help will ever reach us?
[name="Infected Brother"]  It may not happen in my lifetime.
[name="Infected Brother"]  But at very least, they have the ability to help because they know how hard it is for us to even survive.
[name="Infected Brother"]  But you. You know nothing.

[name="Infected Brother"]  Or, just turn back. You can even tell him everything, if you want. What difference does it make?
[name="Infected Brother"]  Point is, there's nothing you can do for me.

[name="Noble Sister"]  Back then, he plunged a chunk of Originium into his arm, right in front of me and our parents, before rushing out of the house.
[name="Noble Sister"]  It took two years to find him again in the slums, completely by chance.
[name="Noble Sister"]  His impetuous temper from before had turned violent, as you've seen, but to me, the biggest change in him was that––
[name="Noble Sister"]  Even though he's alive, he doesn't seem to be living.
[name="Noble Sister"]  Sorry, I'm not sure how exactly to describe it...
[name="Noble Sister"]  He's gotten himself battered and bruised so many times for the sake of his friends, but he doesn't seem to care.

[name="Guard Operator"]  Well, I've been basically watching over you in secret this whole time, so I more or less saw the whole thing.
[name="Guard Operator"]  And I do have an opinion on it. Since you asked, maybe you can tell me if I'm right.
[name="Guard Operator"]  The ransom is only part of what this Carle guy is after.
[name="Guard Operator"]  He does want it, but not for himself. It's for the other Infected who've gathered at his side.
[name="Guard Operator"]  Meanwhile, he doesn't really care what happens to himself.
[name="Guard Operator"]  He used to be nobility, a young lord. But after infecting himself, he's lived in the city as a beggar for years.
[name="Guard Operator"]  Falling from such a great height has only highlighted the oppression of the Infected for him.
[name="Guard Operator"]  Because before all that, he may well have been one of the oppressors.
[name="Guard Operator"]  From another perspective, the death of his loved one made him choose the most irrational, impulsive method of exacting revenge on his father.
[name="Guard Operator"]  And the consequences of that not only banished him to the streets, but also drove his father to ratchet up the oppression.
[name="Guard Operator"]  That has always been a source of the contradiction in his heart.
[name="Guard Operator"]  So I think what he really wants comes after he gets the ransom.
[name="Guard Operator"]  As for his specific plans... Well, the lives of normal people mean little to him, let alone the lives of our Infected.
[name="Guard Operator"]  So I'm guessing either murder or suicide.

[name="Enciodes"]  I've grown accustomed to dealing with others as a transaction, where one party provides something of value and the other reciprocates with equal value, neither side owing anything to the other.
[name="Enciodes"]  But friendship, family, and love cannot be assigned a value.
[name="Enciodes"]  As such, I must choose my partners carefully.

[name="Enciodes"]  I'll be staying here for a few days, so we'll have plenty of time for that.
[name="Enciodes"]  Perhaps you will be able to glean some of the secrets of the Victorian nobility from the vignettes I share with you.

[name="Enciodes"]  Obviously. If a third party were present for this conversation, they would quickly discover—
[name="Enciodes"]  That I did not come here to 'establish' a friendship at all, but simply to have a chat with a friend.

[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#10$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  If that's the case, then the same must be true for you.

[name="Enciodes"]  Alright, Doctor, you're still responsible for showing me around the landship.
[name="Enciodes"]  We can talk more along the way.

[name="Enciodes"]  One more thing.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#2$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  I'll admit that doing things this way may have come as a surprise. Perhaps even caused you some trouble.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  But the next time you see me, you should be glad.
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#10$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]  After all, nobody is better suited to solve your problems than me. Isn't that right?
