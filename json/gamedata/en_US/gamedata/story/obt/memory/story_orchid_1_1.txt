[name="Orchid"] Hello, Jerry. Do you need something from me?
[character(name="avg_npc_223")]
[name="Boy"] A wedding dress! I would like to ask you to make a wedding dress! Please, I beg you!
[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#3")]
[name="Orchid"] You want me to make a wedding dress? I'm afraid you're asking the wrong person. I just edited a fashion magazine.
[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4")]
[name="Orchid"] Besides, we'll be stopping at a city for resupplies next month. You can visit a high-end tailor shop while we're there.

[character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"] Are you really sure about this? I do know a thing or two about fashion design, but I'm not a professional designer. The wedding dress might not be exactly what you're looking for.
[name="Orchid"] Besides, we don't have a very wide variety of fabric onboard. I'll be limited in what I can use to design your dress, and it may not come out looking perfect.
[character(name="avg_npc_223")]

[name="Orchid"] You've got an eye for detail, Penny.
[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_032", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] I did work in design before, but I didn't do a very good job at it. That's why I chose to leave that line of work in the end.

[name="Girl"] No way. You have very good taste.
[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_032", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] Design calls for more than good taste.
[name="Orchid"] Back when I was still in fashion school, my instructor Boyd once told me that my work lacked spirit. He suggested I find another career, said my lack of spirit would only be a waste of a life.
[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#6", name2="avg_npc_032", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] He didn't mean my life, but the collective lives of my customers.

[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#6", name2="avg_npc_032", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] Absolutely. He's an annoying man, but he's also one of Columbia's most famous designers. I really respected him at the time.
[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2", name2="avg_npc_032", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] That's why I had a breakdown. I couldn't keep at it anymore, so I submitted the paperwork to change my major to art history.

[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_032", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] That's not important, Penny.
[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_032", focus=2)]
[name="Girl"] *cough*, to tell you the truth, I really am not worried about you wasting my life.

[name="Girl"] *cough* *cough*...
[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_032", focus=1)]

[name="Orchid"] ............
[name="Orchid"] Darling, I have some bad news. Penny never wanted to see you finished.
[name="Orchid"] Does she like you? Yes, she does. Does she want you, though? No, she doesn't.
[name="Orchid"] Looks like I've wasted a lot of energy on something that I should never have gotten myself mixed up in.
[name="Orchid"] I could finish you and keep you... and no one would know...
[name="Orchid"] But what point is there in doing that?
[name="Orchid"] Phew—
[name="Orchid"] (Picks up the pair of scissors on the desk)
[name="Orchid"] That's why... I'm sorry, my darling.
Under the moonlight, a cold ray of light is reflected on the pair of scissors held high. Just like a cruel, merciless bolt from the blue, it tears the beautiful wedding dress on the hanger asunder, splitting it into two halves.
[character(name="char_278_orchid_1#5")]
[name="Orchid"] I can't finish you.

[name="Human Resources Operator"] No, how could you cut it up?!
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] I've already done it. Another glass of whisky, Joe? Thanks.
[name="Orchid"] I really regretted doing this, especially when Jerry found out the next day that I didn't finish the dress.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"] Was he mad about it?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] I wish he was, but he wasn't.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"] Did he say anything?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] Not a thing. All he did was nod and leave.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"] Well, that sounds terrible.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] You know what made it worse? Penny passed away on the day the wedding was supposed to be held. I didn't go to her funeral, because I didn't know if I could stand to look Jerry in the eye.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"] But that was over two weeks ago. Why are you here drowning your sorrows now?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] Because Jerry paid me a visit this morning.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"] What did he say?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] That he's leaving.
[name="Orchid"] Before he left, he gave me a pair of scissors. He said it was a present Penny once gave him. He wanted to give them to me at the funeral, but I didn't show, and I'd been avoiding him since, so...
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"] He had no choice but to drop in on you.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] Sure enough. Hmm, this glass is all gone too. Get me another?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"] I think you're drinking a little too much.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] You know how well I hold my liquor.
[name="Orchid"] When we said our goodbyes, I tried to comfort the boy and tell him to get back on his feet. It's what Penny would've wanted.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#5", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] But he said to me...

[name="Orchid"] That filled me with regret. I shouldn't have cut the dress up. I should've pushed Penny to go ahead with the wedding. Then maybe Jerry would've felt better.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#5", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"] But you didn't do that.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] Because I wanted to run away, again, and Penny gave me a good excuse to do it.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#5", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] The truth is, every moment I spent with Penny tormented me. I never felt so clearly just how life slips away from somebody, bit by bit.
[name="Orchid"] (Trembling) It scares me... I tried to hold it in and to act normal in front of people.
[name="Orchid"] But I can't help but wonder when I'm alone: What if that was me in the bed?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] I have Oripathy, too!

[name="Human Resources Operator"] (Holds Orchid's hand)
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] So, once again, I crumbled. Once again, I ran away. Once again, I didn't see things through.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=2)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"] Another glass for you, Orchid?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"] Thanks.
[name="Orchid"] (Raises glass)
[name="Orchid"] To Jerry and Penny, to dreams and failure, to that stinking old bastard Boyd...
[name="Orchid"] To life and death.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2", name2="avg_npc_088", focus=1)]
