[name="Melantha"]Yeah...
[Character(name="avg_106_franka_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="char_208_melan_1#3")]
[name="Melantha"]When my Oripathy was still in its early stages, it used to give me really heightened perception.
[Character(name="char_208_melan_1#1")]
[name="Melantha"]And when I came to Rhodes Island, I saw how everyone was working so hard for their fellow Infected, so I thought... since I have this power, I should do something too.
[Character(name="char_208_melan_1#1")]
[name="Melantha"]I should at least try.
[Character(name="char_208_melan_1#4")]
[name="Melantha"]That's how it started, anyway. Since then, my perception's started to recede, and my parents... I haven't been able to get in touch with them for a long time.
[Character(name="char_208_melan_1#1")]
[name="Melantha"]That's why I'm actually very glad that I made this choice. I met so many important friends, and... I can support myself now, even without my parents' help.

[Character(name="avg_106_franka_1#1$1")]
[name="Franka"] Her style is basically the standard Victorian foil. It's the top choice among Victoria's upper-class women who want to stay in shape. Of course, it's mostly just for show. It's not all that practical.
[Character(name="avg_106_franka_1#1$1")]
[name="Franka"] There's really nothing secret about it either. You familiarize yourself with the sword on your first lesson, learn your posture on your second, and how much force to use on your third... It's all the same no matter where you go.
[Character(name="avg_106_franka_1#1$1")]
[name="Franka"] And I learned it myself years ago.
