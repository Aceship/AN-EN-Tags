[name="Goldenglow"]Besides, Indigo, you're an Iberian. You just said you used to live by the sea, and your hair was often damp, right?

[name="Goldenglow"]I suggest you try these anti-static hair masks. They work really well keeping moisture in, and they're a great fit for your hair since it's on the dry side.
