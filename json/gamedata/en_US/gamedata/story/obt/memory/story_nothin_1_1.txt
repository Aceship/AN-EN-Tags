[name="Street Loafer"] To Mr. Chasteberry! To Chasteboy. How about we dedicate this one to your bright future? Goodbye to the days of your street stand!
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#7$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Ah, I see you've preempted me. Cheers.

[name="Street Loafer"] Figured out where you're going yet?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Not yet. 'Farther' is the only direction I have right now. I'll take what luck I find, I suppose.

[name="Street Loafer"] I remember you said you'd been to Kou-wu City before?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#5$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Yes, and all through the towns about Kou-wu. A shame I couldn't scrape by in any of them.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#5$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] Apparently not here either? Feels like you only arrived just yesterday. Haven't experienced the best of good old Yün-shui yet?
[name="Street Loafer"] Ah... whatever. Who hasn't got problems? Look at me, can't find a damn job anywhere, hahaha.
[name="Street Loafer"] Here, one more round.

[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Now, now, let's not rush to our drink. Otherwise, how will you write my letter?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#7$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] Oh! Right, right, right, gotta write your letter. Let's get that out of the way first then? The sooner that's done, the sooner we can drink.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Here, pen and paper. How's your pen-hand, steady?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] Guaranteed. What do I write?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Hm... start with this: 'Young Master Ch'u has gained a noble's guidance, and found meteoric success.'
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] Sure, let's do this.
[name="Street Loafer"] Uh, how do you spell 'guidance'?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#7$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Let me do it with a quick dab of wine. Like this.
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Ah, you've skipped over the... oh, so be it, it does no harm. Continuing...
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] 'His voyage to the capital is long and well, of vistas' breadth and wealth. He invites his parents not to be concerned.'
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#7$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] Gotcha.
[name="Street Loafer"] Hey, how do you know this young master guy anyway? If he's got it so good, how come he's not helping you out?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#6$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Er... his mastery is in the cuisine of gloompincer glass noodle pot. And a fine pot he makes, I might add. He's off to the capital to be a personal chef.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Ah, but a chef must be very careful in doling attention. There are innumerable cuisines across our realm's compass, and oh how they fume at the sight of each other. Your fellow cooks will jeer at your dishes' very orthodoxy.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] That bad?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#8$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Think of this: the capital is chock-full of people who'll only stomach sugared rice dumplings, never salted.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#8$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] Okay, that's pretty bad.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] And there you have it. There are depths even I am not quite willing to ford.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] Yeah, but I've seen you at your street stall. Selling fortunes and feng shui to fried tofu skewers—you just don't seem the pro chef type, y'know? Is he ignoring you? 'Cause your skills don't cut it or whatever?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#6$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] *Sigh* Not a topic I'm partial to...
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] While he was still a chef's understudy, we as fellow disciples cared for him a great deal. Those estranged bonds weigh heavy on his mind, here in his forced departure.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#9$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] He's looked all over for a companion, or at least a shoulder to lean on in times of need, yet how unkind that his road should be too fraught for it.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#5$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] In the end, he could only settle for another writing a letter for him. Don't you see now? His rapport with me stands head and shoulders above. If not, why would he task me with this letter?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#5$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] Oh... when you put it that way, yeah.
[name="Street Loafer"] What do I write next, then? When your disciple buddy can fetch his parents for some fun at the capital? Or when he'll be free to head back home?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#11$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Er... now that, I must admit, I am unsure of.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#5$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Leave it at that, I say. You'll write another letter for me, and we'll drink a good bit more.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Proprietor, more wine!
[Character(name="avg_npc_303_1#1$1" )]
[name="Tavern Owner"] Aye! On its way.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] I like that. Brotherly.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#7$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] But of course. We could hardly dispense with drinking well, before I leave.
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Now. In this one, you write: 'Your good son has passed. Hold your peace, and set no foot into kung fu's affairs.'
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#7$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] Your good son... has passed... huh?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#3$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Phew... best not ask, I wager.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#3$1", name2="avg_npc_305_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Street Loafer"] Wha? Uh, okay.

[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] To be entrusted such a melancholic token, only to have it stolen away. It breaks the heart, it truly does.
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] But unfortunately, this is no matter for the guidance of feng shui. My hands are utterly tied.

[name="Tavern Owner"] Those troublemakers know how to toe the line. I've reported things before. First they couldn't find any evidence, then there wasn't enough to open a case.
[name="Tavern Owner"] Not to mention that some silver bracelet wouldn't be worth a second look in the eyes of a Chi noble. I'm more worried they'll just toss it away somewhere and I'll never know.
[name="Tavern Owner"] That's why I want you to buy it back for me.

[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] That only further dissuades me from action. The master's kung fu shouldn't be spent on all this folly.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#3$1", name2="avg_npc_141#2",focus=2)]
[name="Heroine?"] Is your mind that made up?
[name="Heroine?"] Then I thank you for your mercy, schoolbrother.

[name="Tavern Owner"] Heroine—ah, where is she?
[name="Tavern Owner"] Why are you all alone there now?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] There was a commotion outside just now, and she went off after it.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Tavern Owner"] I see. I did hear fighting while I was in the cellar, and the sound of a fan opening and shutting. I suppose she took them on.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] I'd imagine so too. You must stay out of it, now. Don't peek out until later.
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Oh, yes, and here's your bracelet.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Tavern Owner"] You actually went to get it...?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#6$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] It's always a painful thing to lose what the deceased left behind. I just couldn't help but sympathize—ah, that said, proprietor, no skimping on the reward now.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#6$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Tavern Owner"] Thank you, thank you. Your reward? No problem.

[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Erm, and also, I exhort you to be wary in the coming days. Leave Yün-shui at your earliest opportunity, I'd say...

[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Er, they are... somewhat pissed off, yes.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#5$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Tavern Owner"] ......
[name="Tavern Owner"] Well, thanks a billion, then.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#11$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] I truly am sorry! Proprietor, let me make it up to you! How about another divination? You might... still be in luck, no?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#11$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Tavern Owner"] *Sigh* It's fine. It's been hard doing business here anyhow, what with the Chis bearing down on the place.
[name="Tavern Owner"] Here's the reward we agreed on. Not one fen less.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Ah. Many thanks, fine owner.
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Right, yes, proprietor, do you still have any of those candied plums?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Tavern Owner"] Quite a lot, yeah. You wanted 'em?
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#7$1", name2="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="'Mr. Chasteberry'"] Mm, I'm preparing to wander afar. I'd enjoy some to eat along the way.

My fault.
But I did see him in the middle of the night, escaping by car to the east.
