[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]What?
[name="Ch'en"]I'm just joking here. Why would that mean I hate you?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]This is no joke.
[name="Tourist"]I'm not so sure about settling down here. Dossoles is a great place for a vacation, but it's probably not a place for a normal life.
[name="Tourist"]You've seen what this place is like...
[name="Tourist"]If I end up having a kid, I definitely wouldn't want him to spend his days drinking and gambling, turning into a good-for-nothing son.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Spend his days drinking, just like the two of us right now?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]Sure enough. Exactly what the two of us are doing right now, and my parents call me a good-for-nothing son too.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Haha, I've never been called that.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"](My... parents...)

[name="Ch'en"]I haven't had much of a chance to be a good-for-nothing daughter.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]That must've been tough for you.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]I get by.
[name="Ch'en"]My father is a stubborn old man. Ever since my mother left him and went back home, he's been a self-loathing loafer who knows to do nothing except drinking and gambling. He's even been balding lately. Gross.
[name="Ch'en"]There's no counting on him, so it fell on me to be the breadwinner.
[name="Ch'en"]And ever since I got top marks in all my combat coursework, no one has dared come looking for trouble.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]Sure enough. I saw how you mediated that fight of theirs. That was ruthless and well-executed.
[name="Tourist"]Huh, you know, I really think I've seen you somewhere before, especially with the way you knocked that drunkard out.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]*Cough*... Just your imagination. Don't think too much about it.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]But I mean it, though... Before, if someone'd told me I could move to Dossoles, I probably would've been over the moon.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]That's not what you said just now. You said you definitely wouldn't want to settle down here.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]Come on, try to put yourself in my shoes. I said what I said, but this place is the city of dreams. All Bolívarians hope to come here.
[name="Tourist"]And all of us Bolívarians do everything we possibly can just to be able to come here.
[name="Tourist"]When you get a taste of the Dossoles life, haha, no one would think life outside's as terrible as it actually is.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Forgive me for asking, but you are Bolívarian, am I right?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]You could say that. My hometown was destroyed in a battle a few years ago, though. I had no choice but to move. The place's still a warzone now.
[name="Tourist"]We were all hoping to move to Dossoles, but we didn't have any money. They wouldn't even let us through the gates.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]And then?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]Then? We had no choice but to keep moving east. Somehow we reached Columbia.
[name="Tourist"]None of us knew what Columbia was like, but there was no war there. We could settle down and live in peace... Life started getting better, and I made some decent money.
[name="Tourist"]Now Dossoles lets me through the doors.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Is that so...?
[name="Ch'en"]The city lets you in, and so you see it in a different light.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]I guess you're right, but that's just the way it's meant to be.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]........
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1#2")]
[name="Ch'en"](The lands... and those who live on those lands...)
[name="Ch'en"](So many have gathered here in Dossoles, but it's also turned away so many.)
[name="Ch'en"](In the end, who does this city belong to?)
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]Oh, look at that frown. Don't like the way things work?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Not at all... I'm just thinking about something.
[name="Ch'en"]I don't know much about Bolívar or Dossoles yet. I haven't seen nearly enough here, and it's hard for me to understand why the people here are so fond of the city, unwilling to leave.
[name="Ch'en"]I don't want to make too reckless of an evaluation.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]Why so serious all of a sudden...?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]I'm not being that serious. Just figured I'd speak my mind.
[name="Ch'en"]Criticism is easy, but if you can't come up with a better solution after your criticism, you just come off hasty and irresponsible.
[name="Ch'en"]All I can say is... In my eyes, this isn't that great of a city. At the very least, it's not my kind of city. I think it could've been a much better place.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]Makes sense that outsiders wouldn't think so much of Dossoles.
[name="Tourist"]But to us Bolívarians, it's a decent enough place.
[name="Tourist"]I still remember it, back when I was a kid, there was this one time some folks who claimed to be part of the resistance charged into our homes while I was asleep... None of us were hurt, but it scared my whole family shitless.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]The civil war?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]I guess, though I've never really figured out who's fighting who in that war.
[name="Tourist"]Anyway, thanks to them, the warzone grew bigger and bigger. We lost our farmland and house, everything.
[name="Tourist"]Most Bolívarians are like that. We may lose everything at any moment. Our lives are always hanging by a thread.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]........
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]I think I'm starting to understand.
[name="Ch'en"]No one can so much as guarantee their livelihood is safe, and their homes, however stable they may seem, may be threatened at any moment. Being able to earn the sweat of your brow is like a dream come true.
[name="Ch'en"]If you can manage to live like a normal person, wherever you can pull it off is good enough.
[name="Ch'en"]Dossoles is a good place to the Bolívarians.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]That's right. That's more or less the gist.
[name="Tourist"]Luck was on my side, too. If I hadn't stumbled my way out of the country, Dossoles might still be a paradise to me.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]But what about now?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]I still like it, even now.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Care to explain why?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]There's no why or why not. It's a good vacation spot, and... well... I guess we Bolívarians need something to look forward to.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]........
[name="Ch'en"]What kind of life do you imagine yourself living now, if you'd stayed?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]Hard to say... Maybe like that drunkard just now.
[name="Tourist"]I'd be trying my best to stay in the city, making some small change doing honest work or hitting it big gambling. Most likely, I would spend it just as quickly. It would probably be my lifetime wish to open a shop here...
[name="Tourist"]It's hard to imagine. Maybe I don't count as a real Bolívarian anymore.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]No, you are.
[name="Ch'en"]If I ask you where you are from, how would you answer?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]I'd say I'm from Bolívar, of course.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]That's more than enough.
[name="Ch'en"]If you weren't a Bolívarian, we wouldn't be having such a long conversation over this topic, not even stopping to take a sip of our drinks.
[name="Ch'en"]Your average overseas tourists wouldn't be so interested in this.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]You really have a way with words, you know?
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Really? My friends like to say I have a sharp tongue, when I'm yelling at people.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]Don't be so humble. You speak sense pretty well too.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Haha, thanks for the compliment.
[name="Ch'en"]It's been fun, but I should be going. I hope we'll meet again.
[name="Ch'en"]Columbia... I've learned about its judicial system. It sounds like a nice place. I might find some time to pay it a visit one of these days.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]You're always welcome! If you ever come visit, I'll treat you to a cup of coffee.
[name="Tourist"]You know how Bolívarian coffee brands are famous all around? That's the kind of stuff we use when we have guests over. If you ever come to Columbia, I'll treat you to all the coffee you want.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Very well. I will definitely go, when I get the chance.
[character(name="avg_npc_201",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Tourist"]Let's call it my way to thank you for the drink and the conversation.
[name="Tourist"]Hey, I've been meaning to ask. Where are you from?
