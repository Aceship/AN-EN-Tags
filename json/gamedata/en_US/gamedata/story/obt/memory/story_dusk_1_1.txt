The painter, eyes clouded, raises his head and looks to the ceiling rafters.
By his desk are the several bolts of tough silk that he resolved to purchase months ago.
After he finished painting, before setting out, he imagined scenes of all kinds. Warm ones, ice-cold ones, ones that would make one blush with shame.
The one scene he didn't imagine was that they would look at his painting, then look at him, and fall silent for a good while, before one among them—whoever it was—indifferently muttered the words 'second-rate.'
The others seemed to feel that excessive, and began to make addendum to those two words. However, after they'd finished doing so, not one of them had actually dissented to <i>those two words.</i>

[name="Dusk"]You don't tell them?

[name="Guest"]If they're satisfied with what I paint, that's good enough. What does it matter if the painter's blind or not, really.
[name="Guest"]People often think I paint well, and want me to draw something dead and lifeless like their courtyard, and all I can do is confess my blindness at that point, and give them a fright.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avgnew_2015_dusk_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[name="Dusk"]So it sounds to me like their praise still inflates you with pride?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_799_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Guest"]You've asked me so many questions, sir, but that one is the best.

[name="Guest"]Do you remember that funny term, 'bone-obsequious?'
[charslot(slot="r",name="avgnew_2015_dusk_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Dusk"]I'll never forget it.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_799_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Guest"]I sought others' recognition by every means I could back then, as if I wouldn't survive without the nod from them. My mind to flatter seeped into my bones. They nailed me with those two very words, 'bone-obsequious.' It left me tossing and turning at night.
[name="Guest"]But only afterwards, once I'd left home, and that narrow little patch of world, did I find that it was far from just me. Everyone's either looking to please or be pleased.
[name="Guest"]Is there truly anyone who'll take it all in stride? Maybe. But I haven't met them.
[name="Guest"]Your life starts in infancy following everything your parents say, then comes youth and bowing down to your sweetheart, then you're swept up in the prime of your life trying to cater yourself to the current style, and once you're old, you might well still be going gentle as you can on your children.
[name="Guest"]We please and please and please, but we only do it so those we worry about give us their recognition, and that recognition's only for our own self-comfort.
[name="Guest"]I've not a care now. When I'm flattered, yes, I'm tickled pink. When I'm berated, yes, I'm the most ashamed in the land.
[name="Guest"]But after a nap, I feel easy again, and what others say crosses my eyes and vanishes like smoke.
[name="Guest"]At this point, only my heart's left carrying on my old bone-obsequious self. Just the heart.
