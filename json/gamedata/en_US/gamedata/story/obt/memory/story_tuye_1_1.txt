[name="Tuye"]Okay, fine, I'll give you an out.
[name="Tuye"]Didn't hesitate to go find water for your townsfolk, even if you had to damage your ancestors' graves. That's a meritorious deed if I ever heard one. You report it to the lord ameer, Mr. Mayor, and you get a transfer to wherever the hell you want.
