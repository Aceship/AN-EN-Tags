Adhering by your counsel, I have found Her Royal Highness Alexandrina. However, it shocked me to find that she did not wish to leave her present companions, to travel with me.
Your teachings are still writ in my head. It was every one of you that broke the capture and delivered me out... (The text is struck through.)
(Fresh handwriting follows.)
Her Highness's present companions are a cohort of gang members, with Her as their leader.
Madams Indra and Morgan have given me new uniform, the latter of whom also gifted me her earrings. They say that from today forth, I may consider myself too a member of the Glasgow Gang.
I'm reminded of the time Master Bailey first taught me makeup, as well as her taking me to see the fashion show in secret. I had all but forgotten those memories.
Yet I have not forgotten the vacant throne I am entrusted with, being that I cannot let the Knights fall in further disgrace. I know I can never accomplish this alone no matter what, but this purpose has brought me to this day, and is what I exist for.
I will see our liege back, and Victoria's throne will be vacant no more.

Master Finn,
As mentioned in my previous memorandum, I boarded a landship by the name of Rhodes Island, together with Siege. Today we depart it, and return to Londinium.
Indra asked I hold her final class together with her, and bid farewell to her sparring partners. It was a deliberate move of her so that I'd shake some of my nerves, I know.
I taught them how the Knights fight. I never imagined anyone would care what combat lessons a 'Knight of the Tower' had to teach.
They all know Victoria has its Steam Knights, those tremendous heroes that soar through the air, rumble-ye-rumble. People seem more keen to believe their stories.
But these operators, sparring for practice? The name of 'Tower Knights' is familiar to them too, and their notes hold our combat characteristics as you first taught me. All while they're not even Victorians.
I seem to understand why Indra loves boxing with them so much now.
I apologize, Master.
It's been so long that I'm bound to forget some of what you first taught me. But I still remember how you entrusted me with the matter of the vacant throne, though I can't remember the words in concrete any longer.

Her Masters nudged her to allow some air between her and the Knights' creeds, and they shed their armor, and led her on down to a cramped little basement bar.
They squeezed together on the seats and held each other shoulder by shoulder, so as not to be seen, and sang to the murky ceiling at the top of their voices, singing until the patrons all about them cursed at them for the noise—

[name="Dagda"]I can't quite remember properly. Why did Baird split up with us, back then?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_407_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Siege"]...Because one more time, she just wanted to get word to McClaren.
[name="Siege"]She wanted everyone to come with. That's why she stayed behind. To fetch the bloke she knew from the video shop.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_396_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Dagda"]Her memory was never even that good.
[name="Dagda"]I remember you all talking about how she got all careless once and let a basket of eggs slip. No breakfast for any of you the next morning.
[name="Dagda"]But she remembered how I stamp my feet about when I'm nervous. No one else even noticed, but she came over to me. Comforted me.
[name="Dagda"]Why's her memory so good one moment and so bad the next...?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_407_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Siege"]...I should have gone with her...
[name="Siege"]Maybe I should've persuaded her just a little harder. I knew how she'd stayed there all this time. I knew she'd care for the people more than we <i>could</i> know...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_396_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Dagda"]But we did nothing. You did nothing.

[name="Dagda"]Siege, how much longer will you keep hesitating? When are you finally going to think to make a choice?
[name="Dagda"]You have to choose!
[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=20, ystrength=20, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Dagda"]What IS your path in the end? Are you here as revenge for your friends, to be a king, to be a leader, or is it to see your moral code through? You can't just stay the way you are, not doing anything!

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_396_1#3$1",focus="l")]
[name="Dagda"]You put a decision to me on the way here. You said you weren't the lord I was born to serve. Well, I've made my decision.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_396_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Dagda"]May the Knight die as vassal to her king. May the Knight die for her friends.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_396_1#7$1",focus="l")]
[name="Dagda"]The Knight will abide by virtue, and the Knight will gladly sacrifice. That is my oath.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_407_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Siege"]But, Dagda... It doesn't feel to me like they need an Aslan King anymore. All of that's in the past.
[name="Siege"]I'll stand with you, with them, and with the people aboard this ship. That's all.

[name="Dagda"]......
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_396_1#3$1",focus="l")]
[name="Dagda"]I understand.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_396_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Dagda"]Siege, this Book of the Tower Knights is yours now. You must keep it safe and sound. That's my choice.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_407_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Siege"]What are you...?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_396_1#3$1",focus="l")]
[name="Dagda"]I've realized what Master Finn was trying to tell me, and what it meant for them to stake their lives in order to rescue me.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_396_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Dagda"]They didn't want for me to inherit their burden. They entrusted a 'vacant throne' to me, so I wouldn't deceive myself with the weight of it all like they did... They wanted me to see Victoria's future in their place, with clear eyes.
[name="Dagda"]......
[name="Dagda"]I give this book to you. No longer am I just Isabelle Montague, Knight of the Tower. Now more than ever, I'm Dagda of the Glasgow Gang.
[name="Dagda"]I'm not protecting Victoria's king, no. I'm just protecting my friend.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_407_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Siege"]...Alright.

[name="Dagda"]Never since I swore my oath have the lights in the Palace been lit, out behind the Tower. I've never guarded a Victorian monarch. We Knights of the Tower... long lost everything we ever protected.
[name="Dagda"]So I have to ask. Have the Knights of the Tower accomplished their duty...?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_407_1#3$1",focus="r")]
[name="Siege"]Yes.
