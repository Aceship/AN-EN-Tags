[name="Zofia"]  A press conference for health products? Did this company cooperate with Rhodes Island during the Major? Would you consider talking to them?

[name="Margaret"] I'll have to think about it.
[character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6")]

[character(name="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1")]

[name="An Infected Knight"] So... that's how it is...
[name="An Infected Knight"] The Radiant Knight... The Radiant Knight!

[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] You really have grown, Margaret.

[name="Margaret"] I'm sorry, Uncle Liam. You didn't use any Arts, and I wasn't going to use mine––
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#5$1", focus=1)]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] Nobody ever stipulated that campaign knights cannot use their Arts during a duel.
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] Furthermore, you are no campaign knight, Margaret.

[name="Margaret"] I...
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1", focus=1)]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] I've seen your feats in the arena.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#4$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] Haven't you always looked down on the knight competitions?
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#4$1", focus=1)]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] I've always had contempt for those hypocritical performances, until now.
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] You fought well, Margaret.
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] And the show you put on in the arena... was not the full extent of your power.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#5$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] Is that... a compliment? Thank you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] You've defeated me, once again. Ten years ago, you were already almost unstoppable.
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] And now, you've perfected your techniques and your Arts. A spear that can control its own sharpness far exceeds your prior abilities, as well as what I am capable of.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] But even if I've won...
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]

[name="Margaret"] ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1", focus=1)]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] I asked you to lift your weapon. And so you did. You came here prepared to fight. But... have you thought about what comes next?
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] We made no agreement.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] I never once thought that a single victorious duel would make a Silverlance Pegasus yield to me.

[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] Even if I let those Infected into the city...
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] What does that mean for them afterwards? How should Kawalerielki accept them, and how are they to survive in Kawalerielki?

[name="Margaret"] It's not as if I haven't given these things any thought, Uncle Liam.
[name="Margaret"] Reality... is not a game. The day won't abruptly end, nor will there be a clear-cut winner.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] So, I've made up my mind––
[name="Margaret"] Yesterday, I received a letter from the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi. It credited the Kazimierz Alliance Medical Organization for the Treatment of Infected with substantial contributions to the Major.
[name="Margaret"] Under significant pressure from people of all walks of life, the Adeptus considered allowing this organization to continue working in Kazimierz, and established a special regulatory agency.
[name="Margaret"] And this organization... needs someone who can work closely with both sides to serve as a bridge.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] Margaret, are you saying...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] Please inform the Grand Knight that I will take this position.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] ......
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] Margaret, did you decide all this before you chose to fight me?
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] Yes.
[name="Margaret"] But I also believed you'd want me to demonstrate my determination.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] Hah... Haha... You really have changed.
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] In the past, you only knew how to charge ahead, alone, consuming yourself in your own radiance––
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] When did you learn to take all these other things into consideration?
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] While I was thinking about how to save people.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] During my years of exile, I made some friends who weren't the mightiest of warriors, but had hearts no less sincere than that of any knight.
[name="Margaret"] I may not ever become as thorough and thoughtful as they are.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#3$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"] But I do hope... that my light can illuminate lands far and wide.
[name="Margaret"] To this end, I'm willing to learn some new things.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#3$1", focus=1)]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] Excellent.
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] Those companions of yours must be very trusty indeed.
[Character(name="avg_npc_224")]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] All units––
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"] Allow these Infected persons to enter the city! For the time being, custody over these individuals will be transferred to Margaret Nearl!

[name="Margaret"] Phew...
[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_npc_004",focus=2)]
[name="An Infected Woman"] They're letting us in...? This... Thank you so much, Radiant Knight! You're a lifesaver!
[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_npc_004",focus=1)]
[name="An Infected Knight"] The Radiant Knight...
[name="An Infected Knight"] I don't know... if we can trust you. You helped us, but what good does it do? After all the hardships we've endured to return to Kawalerielki, what kind of life awaits us?
[character(name="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1")]
[name="Margaret"] ...I have no answers for you.
[character(name="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1")]
[name="Margaret"] I'm sorry, but.. I can't make you any promises. Not now, maybe not even for the foreseeable future.
[character(name="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1")]
[name="Margaret"] But, what I can say for sure is, I won't ever stop.
[name="Margaret"] The long and difficulty journey you'll have to face... is the territory I've sworn to defend.

[name="Margaret"] I thought this would be a simple interview. I never expected that you'd be waiting for me here.

[name="Margaret"] I'm here to express my gratitude to you.
[character(name="avg_npc_211_1#3")]
[name="Malkiewicz"] Gratitude? Oh, I see now. You're talking about the report published regarding the settlement of the Infected following the Major? That was nothing more than a minor publication in an inconspicuous weekly medical journal.

[name="Malkiewicz"] I understand that not everything between us is water under the bridge.
[name="Malkiewicz"] But things always change. As you may know, during the Major, I had a rather fruitful relationship with the leaders of Rhodes Island––
[name="Malkiewicz"] So, why would you rule out the possibility that there might be a spark of friendship between us?
[name="Malkiewicz"] After all, we both share the hope for Kazimierz to have a better tomorrow.

Margaret looks at the chairman's assistant's extended hand and hesitates for a moment before shaking it.
This hand does not belong to a knight. It does not sport the callouses of someone who has been honed. It does not have the power to move mountains and split rocks.
––But it runs very hot.
That temperature seems to set the warrior's blood alight almost instantly.
Margaret knows this sensation. Every time she stepped onto the field, every time she stood in the middle of the arena, she felt a similar excitement.
Perhaps some day in the future, Kazimierz too would be filled with this coursing, imperceptible flame.
[Character(name="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", name2="avg_npc_211_1#9", focus=1)]
[name="Margaret"] Yes...
[name="Margaret"] To a better tomorrow.
