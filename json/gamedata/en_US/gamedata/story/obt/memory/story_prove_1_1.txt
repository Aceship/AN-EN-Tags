[name="Provence"]There are quite a number of villages in the wilderness. It's the same in every country.
[name="Provence"]They can't properly enter the nomadic cities, and the arable land around the cities is usually already claimed, so they have no choice but to settle somewhere further and live their lives taking one day at a time.

[name="Tsukinogi"]......
[name="Tsukinogi"]Haha, alright. I understand you.
[name="Tsukinogi"]Equality of life does mean that one's life cannot be valued in terms of wealth or status...
[name="Tsukinogi"]That's a good philosophy.
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]Then...!
[musicvolume(volume=0,fadetime=1)]
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Tsukinogi"]However.
[name="Tsukinogi"]What about your own life, Provence?
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]Huh? I...
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Tsukinogi"]To me, these equal lives also include yours.
[name="Tsukinogi"]Should I just let you put yourself in danger? Only to save more lives?
[name="Tsukinogi"]Would you then weigh the value of lives in terms of numbers, and sacrifice the few to save the many?
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]I...
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]...I wouldn't say so. If something can only be done by sacrificing lives, then there must be something intrinsically wrong with it.
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]But that has nothing to do with our situation! It's not the time to be discussing that either!
[name="Provence"]I know people have a Catastrophe bearing down on them, I have to go and warn them. It's my duty!
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Tsukinogi"]I won't stop you.
[name="Tsukinogi"]After understanding your viewpoint, it'd be wrong of me to stop you.
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]That's good——

[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Tsukinogi"]Yes, I won't stop you. I will go with you.
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]Huh?
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Tsukinogi"]Oh, did you forget? I'm a Catastrophe Messenger too. It's only natural for me to go with you.
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]But... It will really be dangerous...
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Tsukinogi"]I'm aware. That's why I have a request to make of you.
[name="Tsukinogi"]If I determine that the situation is too dangerous, I will stop you even if I have to use force.
[name="Tsukinogi"]Is that acceptable?
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]That...
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Tsukinogi"]I only hope that you can value your own life more.
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]Thank you.
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]I understand. We'll do that then. Let's go!
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]How should I put this... You're very different from how I imagined.
[name="Provence"]I thought that an heiress from Higashi would be more... Umm, elitist and snobbish.
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Tsukinogi"]Oh? That's a complete misunderstanding.
[name="Tsukinogi"]I've always been trying my best to grow closer to everyone at Rhodes Island. I've even started to reach saturation lately.
[Character(name="char_343_tsukinogi_1",name2="char_145_prove_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]Saturation...? That sounds weird...
[name="Provence"]Whatever! Anyway, let's move! If we don't go now, we'll never make it in time!
