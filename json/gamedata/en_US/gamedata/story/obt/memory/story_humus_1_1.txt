[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_491_humus_1#9$1")]
[name="Humus"]Just an old habit from working on my gadgets. Sometimes there's a loose part so you have to smack 'em to get 'em to work.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]
[name="Reporter"]Well, you shouldn't have to worry about that here at the exhibition. It's being sponsored by the top tech firms in Trimounts.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_491_humus_1#8$1")]
[name="Humus"]So I modified this hanger to fold up your clothes once it senses they're dry enough, and then this device down here tosses 'em into the wardrobe.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_524_1#1$1")]

Under the dim moonlight, Humus reassembles the bracelet, then takes out an identical bracelet from his pocket.
The cold glint of metal stings his eyes.
He fiddles with the bracelets before putting one of them back on the shelf, and the other underneath it.
He looks to the sides and nods once satisfied that the bracelet underneath cannot be easily spotted. And then sighs.
[name="Humus"]......
[name="Humus"]*Sigh*...

The woman tosses the bracelet onto the table and reaches into her bag for a cord, only to see the bracelet begin to bounce on the table.
Before she can react, it flies into the air and starts spraying colorful sparks in all directions.
The audience looks on, dumbfounded, as the bracelet continues to spin in the air and spit out fireworks.

Humus reaches into his pocket and pushes the remote control's slider up to max.
Orchestral music begins to play from the bracelet, and soon the hall is filled with a soaring soprano solo.
The members of the audience look at each other incredulously.

Humus presses a button on his remote control.
The orchestra stops, replaced by a lively electronic dance tune.
