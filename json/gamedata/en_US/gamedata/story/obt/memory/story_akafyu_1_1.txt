The swordsman sheaths her blade and takes a deep breath. Then, she takes out a dagger and adds another mark to the tally on the wall.
It has been 137 days since her exile from Higashi, and 39 days since she arrived in this strange, foreign city called Lungmen.
Before she left Higashi, she received the invitation of a company called 'Rhodes Island' and was told she still had a chance to fight as a swordsman—perhaps something her master had consented to without her knowledge.
Her only duty for now is to wait here patiently until the company's handler comes to take her to her new asylum—a place far from Higashi.
The road ahead is uncertain.

As the saying goes, a vagrant swordsman is as fragile as a fowlbeast. The sharper the blade in their hands once was, the easier it is to break.
She had run into several nearly-fatal encounters before leaving Higashi, and while her journey since then had been relatively uneventful, she can't be certain her enemies hadn't followed her to this foreign land. She mustn't let her guard down.
Per the arrangement, every ten days, at the exact same time on the dot, someone comes by to leave her daily necessities by the door, and she should not freely leave the room.

From the window, she can see but a corner of this strange city. Lungmen's size is on a completely different scale compared to her hometown, though it does bear some resemblance to the stories she's heard of bizarre, dazzling cities under the Southern Court's rule.

For the first time since a little more than a month ago, the swordsman takes a careful step outside the room and observes the area from a low angle.

[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]A peaceful place.
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]There, you'll find Ursus, Higashinese, Kazimierzians, and Leithanians.
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]I'm not saying that we make everyone pretend that all those unpleasant things never happened. It's just that we don't operate on a logic based on hatred and violence.

[name="Akafuyu"]But I was told that I still had a chance to fight as a swordsman with Rhodes Island.

[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]Oh, you will. There are many excellent warriors like you aboard. We're a pharmaceutical company, but sometimes you need to fight to save lives.
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]But most of the time, everyone spends their time doing normal things. Eating, drinking tea, and figuring out ways to avoid situations where we have to fight.

[name="Akafuyu"]Hmph...
[name="Akafuyu"]Interesting. I will take a good look at this place myself.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_090",focus="r")]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]Heh, you seem a lot easier to get along with than I expected.
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]Do you need time to pack your things before we get on our way?

[name="Akafuyu"]All I need is this blade. Let's go.
