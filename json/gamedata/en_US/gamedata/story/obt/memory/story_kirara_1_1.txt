[name="Utage"]Doesn't happen that fast, girl.
[name="Utage"]But I heard Akafuyu say the L.G.D. finished their investigation and figured out it wasn't actually him who held up the jewelry store. Now he's got charges for obstructing public duty and... something, whatever it was? I don't remember.
[name="Utage"]Considering he also kinda got baited into the mafia too, he'll probably get a year and a half and then deported out.

[name="Kirara"]All I did was make him notice my phone, and that was it.
[name="Kirara"]He saw what was on there and realized I wasn't lying to him while I was in the car. Wasn't more than that.

[name="Utage"]Seriously? Sooo what kinda spell did you put in your phone to make a hard-boiled guy like that give himself up?
[Character(name="avg_478_kirara_1#7",name2="char_337_utage_story_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Kirara"]It wasn't a spell or anything, just some super normal stuff.

[name="Utage"]You sure?

[name="Utage"]Hmm...
[name="Utage"]Not gonna push you, then.
[name="Utage"]Bye-bye, Kirara. Get some sleep if you're worn out, okay?

[delay(time=1)]
Kirara fishes out her phone, and scrolls the whole way down her drafts, until she hits the day she set out.
Since leaving that nomadic city she called home, her phone's mail service has been out of commission.
But leaving home for the first time, the girl still records everything she sees, hears, feels and thinks, no matter how big or small, in her drafts folder.
Kirara pulls a sheet of letter paper from her drawer, and copies from her drafts, going character by character, by word, by sentence.
A folder filled both with great chunks of text, and messy fragments of phrases.
