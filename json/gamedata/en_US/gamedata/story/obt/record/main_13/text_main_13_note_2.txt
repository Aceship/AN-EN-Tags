Mum:
To get to the opening ceremony on time, Papa brought me along on a caravan route that only a few outsiders would know of.
The handler specially picked their most docile burdenbeast to carry us up the mountain, and we had to nestle in the two large saddlebags on its back. It was so cramped, but it was a really interesting experience too.
I even learned that some burdenbeasts can drag a sled full of goods with their tails while carrying three to four people. I couldn't believe my eyes.
This trip has not only corrected many of my misconceptions of Kjerag, but helped me understand some other things too.
The 'backward and isolationist' Kjerag exists only in the imaginations of those who understand Terra solely from the papers. In reality, things have always been changing across this beautiful land.
I understand now why Papa was so insistent on bringing me along.
