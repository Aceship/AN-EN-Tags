Amphelise:
Remember Delphine's expression when she got the violin? I should've gotten that unforgettable pout on camera.
Anyway, since I'm already here in Heidenschwiel, I ought to pick her a uniquely Leithanian gift from your friends' recommendations. I'll give her another present to make up for it when I'm back in Windermere. ——Kent
