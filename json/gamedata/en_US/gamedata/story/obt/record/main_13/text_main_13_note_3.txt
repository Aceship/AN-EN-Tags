Very well done.
Kent Windermere. You've indeed fulfilled the promise made on our wedding night—I will no longer entertain any objection to my decision from anyone in my demesne.
Ken, our union has been the most unexpected thing to have happened to me since I inherited my title. When you tore through the crowd at the ball and barged into the command center to ask directly for my hand, your unabashed ambition deterred me from treating you as yet another frivolous nobleman. You gave up your family name and willingly subjected your honor as the Earl's second son to criticism. You've received many a cold shoulder while attending banquets with me, yet never uttered a word of complaint.
As such, you deserve compensation from me—the pledge I made to you at our wedding, that someday Windermere too will hear from Lord Kent, has never expired.
Attend the dukes' upcoming secret meeting in Londinium on my behalf. I have already appointed you as my plenipotentiary.
Another thing: Delphine and I will arrange a private celebration at my headquarters upon your return.
——Amphelise, Duke of Windermere, Lynncardine 1093.11
