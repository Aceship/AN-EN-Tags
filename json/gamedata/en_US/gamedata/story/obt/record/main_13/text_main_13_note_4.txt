Your Grace:
I've successfully stolen into Londinium, and this was not done on impulse. As you've taught me, I'll never let personal emotion cloud my judgment, so please don't worry. I decided on this only after careful consideration.
I miss the days we spent together and the life we enjoyed at Lynncardine, but I'm sure I'll be more useful here.
This place has more or less become the eye of the storm, accumulating momentum as news from all across Terra pours in rapidly. I'm sure I'll mature faster here. So you need not worry that I won't be polishing the skills I need, now that I'm far from Lynncardine.
Another thing: I ended up re-investigating the cause of Papa's passing, and he did indeed die from illness on his way back to Lynncardine after the meeting. Mum, I swear to you that this investigation into the truth behind his death will be my last self-indulgent act.
