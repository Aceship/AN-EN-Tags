Mum:
I've made some new friends, and they've been really nice to me. So I've changed my address to their 'Slobberknocker' boxing gym for the time being.
Life remains the same, and we can even watch movies here. 'Beautiful Life' is my favorite from the recent releases I've seen.
Everything's fine, so there's no need to worry.

Your Grace:
The mayor of Londinium choked to death at yesterday's banquet, but everyone present was fully aware that it was the Military Commission's doing.
It was a signal as well as a warning. I believe that in a few days, Parliament will fully surrender to the Commission.
The city's communications have been affected, and I've asked my sources to lay low for now and wait for the situation to develop before we make any further steps.
I can still handle things here.
——Delphine
I miss you, Mum.
