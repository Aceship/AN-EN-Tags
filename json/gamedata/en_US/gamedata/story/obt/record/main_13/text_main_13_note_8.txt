Mum:
This postcard all the way from Siracusa is my favorite among my recent collection.
It's been a year since the pizzeria distributed this design as an advert, but it still brings me back to the days when Papa would take me on a long trip just to taste some authentic pizza...
I'm doing great here, Mum, so don't worry about me.

Your Grace:
You were right. The Military Commission has infiltrated Londinium and they now control large parts of the industrial areas. They even have people broadcasting propaganda for them. I sent this message via an unassuming postcard just to be safe.
Even if Parliament were fully aware of what the Military Commission is plotting, they lack the time for effective countermeasures. I found out your plan to unite the other dukes to march on Londinium, as well as that it failed, but that's nothing unexpected. Each duke has their own objectives, and they all want to reap the biggest benefits.
The dukes will never be able to work together.
Look at all these messages I've sent you—they're only the tiniest sliver of what the intelligence network I've managed to set up in Londinium has produced. I think this should suffice as a demonstration of my abilities and determination, so there's no need to urge me to return to Windermere.
