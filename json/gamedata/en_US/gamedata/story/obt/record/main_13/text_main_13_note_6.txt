Mum:
Telling our citizens that the Sarkaz are a civilized race is beyond absurd.
The pictures they use in their attempts to teach these barbarians the joys of teatime are simply a display of our arrogance. Though I'm still going to participate in the public lecture scheduled in a few days. Since according to a document I acquired, the invitation had many of the city's noble names printed on it.
I'd love to see their expressions when they meet an actual Sarkaz.
I bet you'll laugh when you see this postcard.

It was Parliament's decision.
After the Dukes of Cavendish and Stafford instigated unrest by bringing them into the city, Parliament has also realized the possibility of using the Sarkaz mercenaries to handle other matters. You should know this better than I do, but I'm guessing the main reason why Parliament even dared to make this decision was because the Sarkaz did such an excellent job when they got rid of the Steam Knights.
They're all indulging in their fantasy that holding these public lectures will reduce the public's fear of the Sarkaz, and they'll regret it sooner or later.
