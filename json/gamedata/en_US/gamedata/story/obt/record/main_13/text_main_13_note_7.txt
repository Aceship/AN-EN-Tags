Delphine:
This year, I received yet another invitation to speak at the Windermere Military Academy's opening ceremony, and the headmaster mentioned your name again.
You've been an honor student twice in a row and are a role model for many freshmen. I won't deny my influence undergirding this honor, but your efforts and achievements in the academy are clear for all to see.
That worn-out sword still hangs on the drill grounds' weapon rack, and the bloodstains imprinted by your palm through heavy use are still visible on the hilt's wrapping. The headmaster has repeatedly mentioned to me that even were you not to become a general, you would have become the most valiant fighter under my command. You have learned to stay rational in battle, and to make the right decisions.
I hold the same expectations of you. You needn't have left me for Londinium.
Delphine, I too am pained by your father leaving us, but the Duke of Windermere can show no weakness. I won't demand your understanding, but I pray you realize that you must master all of this before you inherit my title.
