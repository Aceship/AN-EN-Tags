My name is Finn Henderson. I am a Knight of the Tower.
I was named Captain of the Watch by my late predecessor, Jeffrey Mays. The position was traditionally appointed by the king, but with the lights of the palace extinguished, it falls upon me to take up the mantle and maintain the <i>Book of the Tower Knights</i>.
These records have gone on uninterrupted for centuries, since before Londinium was founded. The life of each and every Knight of the Tower is recorded herein. I should have stopped after the account of Sir Mays, but I fear that there will be none to follow me.
Therefore, in a break from tradition, I am adding an appendix to the book, for whomever may read it.
