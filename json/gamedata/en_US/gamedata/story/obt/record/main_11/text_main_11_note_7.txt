Three years have passed since His Majesty's passing. Peace has largely returned to Londinium.
Less than fifty Knights of the Tower remain. I had to adjust the schedule to ensure that knights on night watch duty can be put in pairs. Absences have become increasingly frequent. When Mitchell and Ferguson failed to show up to their shift on time two days ago, I found them drinking at a tavern, against orders. It was the third incident of this type this month.
My old comrade Edgar resigned yesterday. We stood vigil one last time before he left. He advised me to leave the Tower sooner rather than later. Like appointments, resignations by Knights of the Tower used to require the king's approval, but all it takes now is a letter of resignation delivered to the parliament.
Edgar has become disillusioned. He feels that the honor of the Knights of the Tower died with His Majesty three years ago.
But the greatest dishonor would be if there was no Knight of the Tower to carry the torch by His Majesty's side when he returns.
That is why I have chosen to stay.
