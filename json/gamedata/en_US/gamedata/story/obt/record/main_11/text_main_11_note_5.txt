Jeffery Mays was born in County York.
He served with the 2nd Regiment before joining the Knights of the Tower at the age of 34.
He was named Captain of the Watch at the age of 49. At 53, he led six hundred Knights of the Tower against the Londinium defense forces when the latter launched a coup on the eve of the king's birthday. More than half of the knights were killed in the battle but still not enough to stop the tragedy.
Even after the coup was successful, Mays refused to capitulate to the parliament. He was removed from his position and imprisoned, dying of illness in prison one month later.
