  In recent days, with security conflicts escalating, violent gangs in Sudean Borough have activated city defense artillery and caused grave damage to several districts.
This is the first time Londinium's defensive artillery has fired within its own walls. The hour of sustained bombardment caused several plates to collapse, and major casualties were witnessed on scene.
  Since October of last year, violent gangs who deserve no fame have persistently antagonized Parliament's new safety bill, disturbed defense force patrol enforcement, caused conflicts on multiple occasions, and posed a grave menace to the stability of society. In only three months, over 200 counts of public violence have been recorded in Sudean Borough, placing it as the district of most concern with regard to law and order.
  As a vital light industry region to Londinium, the array of manufacturing in Sudean Borough constitutes over 90% of Londinium's total light industry output. Following this bombardment incident, a great number of factories in Sudean Borough have suffered damages, and forecasts indicate a return to normal production order is highly unlikely in the short term, with severe impact on associated downstream industries.
  Spokesmen for the Londinium-Kazdel Association of Economic and Cultural Exchange have sternly condemned the conduct of these violent gangs, and in following indicate that Kazdel parties will aid in Sudean Borough reconstruction work, so as to progressively return citizens' manufacturing lifestyles to normal order.
