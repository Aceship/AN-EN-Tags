  It's my second time now meeting that Sarkaz, or should I say, being taken aside by him for questioning.
Interrogations like that are awfully common; he let me go quickly. Still, I feel his manner wasn't quite like other Sarkaz.
  I found out beforehand a squad of Sarkaz mercenaries might get in touch with us, but I still haven't noted any hostility or explosive burning in Londinium tallying with that codename yet.
  I asked that Sarkaz today about his name. He acted somewhat oddly; ridiculing me, most likely. 'No need to bother committing any Sarkaz to memory. We'll die in one blink, and be forgotten in the next,' he said, showing me the Originium crystals on his face.
  I don't know if I can work with the Sarkaz or not. The more stories I learn in this city, the harder it is to judge.
  'Old friend' is practically a clich√© between Sarkaz in Londinium. Most met in the civil war before, then again in a different battle later on. Their deepest bond is knowing they can never trust each other. Even decade-old friends will hack off the hand clung to their starboard one day, in order to keep their own ship afloat.
  The Sarkaz don't mince this attitude at all. They're forever in battle mode.
  If Victoria is engulfed by flames of war like in Kazdel yore, I wonder how we will end up?
  P.S. On top of Oriron supply being cut off, some other common industrial products are gradually vanishing from the market. Rockrock and co. will be very troubled keeping work going if materials dry up to this extent.
  Though even if we win the companies' support, there's no reliable transport channel as of now. The railway owners have confirmed to me that freight trains can only transport industrial materials to Central Londinium currently, and personal transport uses have to go through approval.
