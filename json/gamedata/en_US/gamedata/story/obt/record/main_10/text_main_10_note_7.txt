  Yesterday, an awards ceremony for Victorian theater held in the Auchterigg Borough of Londinium was temporarily halted due to a fire alarm.
  At around 8 o'clock, the fire alarm was sounded without warning. The awards committee immediately activated risk management plans, suspending the ceremony and evacuating staff present. After confirming the fire alert did not pose a threat to the venue, the ceremony was quickly resumed with order restored.
  Numerous nobles and celebrities, including the Duke of Caster, attended the ceremony. After it was resumed, Arnold was awarded Best Actor in a Leading Role, his third time enjoying the honor.
  Despite no casualties among personnel nor any property damage, the awards committee still received numerous complaints, the complainants criticizing the unnecessary fright the false fire alarm put them through.
  Reports indicate that the fire in fact broke out at the factory site next door, caused by an improved incendiary weapon thrown in a fight between local street thugs of which one suffered second degree burns, and several makeshift houses were destroyed. Eyewitnesses state that Hannah 'Indra' Jackson and her followers were likely involved in the fight. Police are currently conducting a follow-up investigation due to the gang members' injury of Baron Grant.
