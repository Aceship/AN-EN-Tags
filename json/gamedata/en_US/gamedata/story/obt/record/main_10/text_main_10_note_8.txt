  At the behest of Her Highness Theresa and His Highness Theresis, the Military Commission of Kazdel today carried out necessary attacks on the rebels in Londinium, and the last plate occupied by the rebels has been cleansed. As of now, the entire city of Londinium has been awed into submission, and all obstacles to His Highness's plans have been removed. The city's industrial assembly lines will work day and night in casting a victory for the Sarkaz.
  Londinium continues to extend an invitation to you, my fellow Sarkaz who wander the land. After the war, the Sarkaz will have a home to return to.
  Military Commission of Kazdel
