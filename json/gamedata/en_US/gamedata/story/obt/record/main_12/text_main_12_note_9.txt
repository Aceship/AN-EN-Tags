To the Victorian citizens of Norport Borough:
During the joint assault between the Duke of Wellington, the Duke of Caster, and the Duke of Windermere, we have largely broken through the blockade of Norport Borough. The light of Mother Victoria once again shines upon her dear child. Though there are still sporadic Sarkaz troop activities in the city, most of the area is already under our control.
Citizens of Victoria, you are now safe!
According to our statistics, during this small-scale turmoil, Victorian troops suffered 32 casualties, 291 injuries, 464 MIA, totaling 787 souls. In Norport Borough, there were 2,154 civilian casualties and 6,473 injuries, and we are in the process of tabulating more detailed data. The dukes' forces are also quickly mobilizing to provide relief to affected citizens. We pay the utmost respects to everyone who made sacrifices in service of glorious Victoria during this battle, soldier or civilian.
All surviving Victorian citizens, please ensure your safety by reporting to nearby Victorian troops as soon as possible, and accept the protection of the dukes!
Though I am but an ordinary military clerk, I was touched by the sincerity of your emotions the moment I set foot on Norport's plate.
I had the privilege of witnessing an ordinary citizen sacrifice himself in a blaze of glory to save a flag bearing the insignia of our great mother, Victoria. What an inspirational display of bravery and patriotism!
As such, I now call upon in my personal capacity only:
Citizens of Victoria in Norport Borough, please follow the examples of those who have sacrificed themselves out of love, so that our compatriots will never again be slaughtered, so that our progeny will never again be trodden upon. For the sake of a freer future, rise up and unite! Join the dukes' forces, and let us fight against the vile Sarkaz and usher in the glorious victory of Mother Victoria!
