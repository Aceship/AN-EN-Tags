[HEADER(is_skippable=true, is_autoable=false)] 训练关卡15

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] Looks like we have many people here today... Huh? Oh, Amiya, you are here too!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Yeah, Instructor Dobermann asked me to take part in this training too. I heard that today's session would be the last training.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Correct. Doctor has pretty much reviewed all basic combat strategies in previous trainings.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Next, I’ve prepared a final challenge for the Doctor — defend against a wave of enemy elites.

Doctor, get ready. Your deployment points will be very limited in this operation.

          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \

You must use your discretion to withdraw temporarily unnecessary Operators for more DP.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Remember, half of DP cost will be refunded when withdrawing ordinary Operators. For some Vanguard Operators like Plume, <@tu.kw>all DP will be refunded</>.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] This is going to be a very tough fight, and without a doubt, a great challenge for you.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Good luck, Doctor. And you too, Jessica.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] I will do my best! I think I am very familiar with everything already. Doctor, rest assured that we are ready for your orders.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Dr. {@nickname}, time to show me what you are capable of.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] For the sake of all of our futures…
