More enemy troops are coming, but Plume alone cannot block all of them.

[PopupDialog(focusX=-62, focusY=63, focusWidth=114, focusHeight=120, anchor="BottomRight", \

Fortunately, Vanguard <@tu.kw>Fang</> has arrived.

[PopupDialog(focusX=-62, focusY=63, focusWidth=114, focusHeight=120, anchor="BottomRight", \
             animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", \
             dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
As a Vanguard, <@tu.kw>Fang</> also has a very low deployment cost. But unlike Plume, <@tu.kw>Fang</> has lower attack and higher defense. She can also block <@tu.kw>two</> enemies at the same time.

[PopupDialog(focusX=-62, focusY=63, focusWidth=114, focusHeight=120, anchor="BottomRight", \
             animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", \
             dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
On top of that, Fang's ability can also provide lots of cost <@tu.kw>periodically</>, which will be ideal for the subsequent deployment of other Operators.

[PopupDialog(focusX=225, focusY=40, focusWidth=117, focusHeight=104, \
             animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", \
             dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
Please deploy <@tu.kw>Fang</> immediately to defend against the incoming enemies.
