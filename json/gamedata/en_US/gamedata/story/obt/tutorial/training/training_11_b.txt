[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Doctor, please watch out for the enemy's elite units.

          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \

The Heavy Defender has high attack and extremely high defense. We won't be able to hold our defense once it merges with other enemy troops.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Fortunately, there aren't many enemy elite units. We can significantly weaken them before they arrive at the main stage.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] The best way to deal with a large and slow enemy unit is to use a <@tu.kw>Slowing Supporter</> and a <@tu.kw>Single-target Caster</> Operator in tandem.

[Tutorial(focusX=-179, focusY=63, focusWidth=119, focusHeight=123, anchor="BottomRight", \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
As a Slowing Supporter, <@tu.kw>Orchid</> can greatly <@tu.kw>reduce enemy's move speed</>, thus slowing down its attack pace.

[Tutorial(focusX=-61, focusY=62, focusWidth=117, focusHeight=123, anchor="BottomRight", \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
While the enemy is controlled, Single-target Casters like <@tu.kw>Durin</> can deal <@tu.kw>lots of damage</> to it.

[Tutorial(focusX=1, focusY=-55, focusWidth=258, focusHeight=153, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
Deploy them here to prevent the Heavy Defender from joining with other enemy units.
