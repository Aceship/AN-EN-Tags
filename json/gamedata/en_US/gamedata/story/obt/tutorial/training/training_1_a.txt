Rhodes Island Combat Training Ground
[Dialog]

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] Instructor Dobermann, I'm sorry...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Operator Jessica. According to the schedule, you’re 3 minutes and 14 seconds late.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] I'm so sorry! It took me some time to ready my equipment… What do I need to do next?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Operator Jessica, your new mission objective is to perform a combat drill simulating Dr. {@nickname}'s behaviors.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] Huh?? Me?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] The operation to rescue the doctor will be carried out in a few days. Now, we need a simulation based upon something representative of the actual situation.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] I will show you some more advanced combat techniques. Those who participate in the operation will also be more familiar with these techniques so they can assist better.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] I see...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Jessica, deploy <@tu.kw>Yato</> and <@tu.kw>Rangers</> to engage the enemy.
