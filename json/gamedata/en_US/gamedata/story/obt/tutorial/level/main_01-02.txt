[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_fang")] Tsk, another wave of enemies has showed up! Amiya and others are not here yet. We still need to defend this rendezvous point.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] Uh... I really worry about them. I wonder if Instructor Dobermann and others are safe... I just can't seem to contact them at all...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_beagle")] Don't worry, Jessica! I'm sure they can rescue Dr {@nickname}.

The terrain here is not favorable for us. The Enemy can easily strike us from two directions. Adnachiel, do you have a clear visual on the nearby situation from upstairs?

The upper lane is quite narrow and I don't see many enemies coming. Perhaps we can defend this wave!

Awesome! Just deploy a few Operators in the upper lane and we will be fine.
