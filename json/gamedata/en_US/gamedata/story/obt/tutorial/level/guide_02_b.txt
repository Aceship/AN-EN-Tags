However, activating so many weapons together is not easy. Doctor, you must tell her the correct timing to do so.

<@tu.kw>Some of the DP cost will be refunded</> when an Operator is withdrawn. However, defeated Operators will not refund any DP.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] But you must not let your guard down yet. If you fall here, all our efforts will go to waste.
