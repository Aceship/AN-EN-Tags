[Battle.Pause]

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] Unable to break through the enemy's armor! Requesting backup!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Well done, Jessica. After all those simulated battles, you're showing pretty solid improvement.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] Eh?!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Calling Firewatch. <@tu.kw>Deployment Waiting Zone</> T032. Requesting backup. Make your way there immediately.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_milu")] Acknowledged.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_milu")] Calling Instructor Dobermann. Firewatch has reached the designated position.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Watch out. This mission's requirements are demanding. We can only deploy two operators. That said, you can <@tu.kw>Relieve</> Jessica and deploy straight on her location.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] <@tu.kw>Relieve</>? Is that different from our usual deployments?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] It's an all-new tactic. Watch out, Jessica. When Firewatch is deployed on your position, you'll need to pull out immediately.

          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] \
Straight to the <@tu.kw>Recuperation Area</>?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] That's right. Make sure you recuperate with the time you have. If we run low on manpower at the Preparation Area, we need send everyone at the Recuperation Area back.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] Understood!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Also, PRTS has prepared all-new <@tu.kw>Tactical Equipment</> for everyone. It allows the Relieving Operator to inherit some of the Relieved Operator's abilities and <@tu.kw>enhances</> the former's combat capabilities.

Doctor, go ahead and deploy Firewatch on Jessica's position.
[Tutorial(waitForSignal="select_direction", dialogHead="$avatar_doberm", animStyle="Drag", \
          startX=-70, startY=-50, endX=250, endY=-50)] \
Good. Now, <@tu.kw>select a direction</>.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_milu")] It seems like I'm attacking faster now. Is that because of the <@tu.kw>Tactical Equipment</> Jessica left behind?
[Tutorial(focusX=-180, focusY=-37, focusWidth=150, focusHeight=150, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
That's right. Your Tactical Equipment has been activated. Take a closer look at the <@tu.kw>darker colored equipment</> around you.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_milu")] I see.

          animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black=0.5, \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
Now, Doctor, focus on Firewatch.

[Tutorial(focusX=242, focusY=-111, focusWidth=480, focusHeight=235, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",anchor="Left", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
Very good. The specific effects of the Tactical Equipment that Firewatch inherited are displayed here.
[Tutorial(focusX=242, focusY=-111, focusWidth=480, focusHeight=235, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",anchor="Left", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
Depending on the Relieved Operator's class, the Relieving Operator will also inherit different Tactical Equipment. For example, Jessica is a <@tu.kw>Sniper</> Operator. Therefore, Firewatch received <@tu.kw>Sniper Equipment</>.
[Tutorial(focusX=242, focusY=-111, focusWidth=480, focusHeight=235, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",anchor="Left", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
Be careful, though. Each Operator can inherit at most <@tu.kw>five</> pieces of Tactical Equipment.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_milu")] So when another Operator relieves me, they will also <@tu.kw>inherit</> the Tactical Equipment left behind by Jessica and me.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Exactly.
