[Battle.Pause]

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_skadi")] Oh, I didn't know we got these <@tu.kw>Transfer Permits</> after defeating these enemies.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_grani")] Instructor Dobermann, we've defeated the enemies.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Understood. We have a <@tu.kw>brief</> rest period right now. We'll use this opportunity to resupply.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_grani")] Acknowledged.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_skadi")] Something doesn't seem quite right with these enemies...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_mudrok")] They feel <@tu.kw>stronger</> than before.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] It's because of their Amplifier Device.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_grani")] Amplifier Device?

Here, the enemies also have equipment that <@tu.kw>enhances</> their abilities. Watch out, their <@tu.kw>Danger Level</> increases as the battle goes on.
[Tutorial(focusX=-181, focusY=-29, focusWidth=202, focusHeight=44, anchor="Top", \

Every time the Danger Level increases, the enemy gains greatly increased <@tu.kw>HP</> and increased <@tu.kw>ATK</> and <@tu.kw>DEF</>; this increase is also permanent.
[Tutorial(focusX=-181, focusY=-29, focusWidth=202, focusHeight=44, anchor="Top", \

So the longer the battle lasts, <@tu.kw>the more dangerous it gets</>?

That's right. We need to put an end to this ASAP.

Once the Operators in the Preparation Area have all been deployed, everyone at the Recuperation Area and I will stand by at the <@tu.kw>Preparation Area</>. We'll be ready to assist at any time.
