[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Doctor, next up, we will have a formal combat mission.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Before that, I need to go over two new rules.

[Tutorial(focusX=1, focusY=63, focusWidth=1154, focusHeight=126, anchor="Bottom",  \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
Before the mission begins, several <@tu.kw>randomly</> selected Operators will be dispatched to assist us in the fight.

[Tutorial(focusX=112, focusY=64, focusWidth=470, focusHeight=122, anchor="Bottom",  \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
At this point in time, you may send <@tu.kw>up to four</> Operators to the<@tu.kw>Preparation Area</> and select four other Operators to <@tu.kw>reorganize</> your Initial Squad with.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Furthermore, we've prepared some <@tu.kw>Transfer Permits</> that you may use to assign Operators as you see fit.
[Tutorial(focusX=112, focusY=64, focusWidth=470, focusHeight=122, anchor="Bottom",  \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
That said, you should be careful about one thing: the Deployment Waiting Zone can only hold a <@tu.kw>limited</> amount of Operators. Once it is <@tu.kw>full</>, Operators can <@tu.kw>no longer be stationed</> there and must instead head to the Recuperation Area.
[Tutorial(focusX=-115, focusY=160, focusWidth=229, focusHeight=39, anchor="BottomRight", \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
One more thing. The Deployment Limit during Stationary Security Service operations is <@tu.kw>extremely limited</>.
[Tutorial(focusX=-115, focusY=160, focusWidth=229, focusHeight=39, anchor="BottomRight",  \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
Which is why you must think your strategy through.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Doctor, are you ready?
