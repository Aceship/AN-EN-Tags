[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_frstar")] The Originium materials I asked you to prepare in advance? Do you have them on you?  If not, fall back!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_frstar")] My father's witchcraft doesn't separate enemy from ally. Anyone's life can be sucked away. If they didn't prepare properly, Patriot would be the only living thing left on the battlefield!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_talulaFighter")] I have the materials on me. I've also applied the paints to myself just like you told me.  Anything else to worry about?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_frstar")] No, you're good.  We were short on resources this time, so we just put up a simple installation...
[Tutorial(focusX=-50, focusY=20, focusWidth=120, focusHeight=120,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_frstar", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] Thanks to our secret protective measures, the Originium Altar will have next to no effect on us.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_frstar")] But if it was a properly constructed altar, then no matter what tricks you tried, you wouldn't escape the witchcraft's effects... nobody'd live to tell the tale.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_frstar")] Get ready!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_frstar")] Talulah, count yourself lucky. Lucky my father's standing with us tundra Infected, on our side...
