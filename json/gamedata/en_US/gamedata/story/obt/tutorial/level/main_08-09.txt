[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_shield")] What's that? It's not the Ursus Army... What trickery is this? 
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_rosmon")]You haven't seen the Infected codenamed Mephisto control them, I guess?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_shield")] What?! 
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_shield")] I thought Mephisto was supposed to be a medic for the Infected!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_rosmon")]It doesn't matter either way... but these special Infected are nothing like what they said on the reports. They were driven here. There isn't a clear pattern to their actions.  
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_rosmon")]It's just... there's so many of them...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_shield")] Doesn't matter! We can't let these Infected monsters breach our front! Don't give the Ursus troops any openings!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_rosmon")]There's too many of them...!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_shield")] Do not be afraid to make sacrifices!! 
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_rosmon")]...What should I do? I... I might be able to do something to help the Shieldguards on the frontlines. There is something I can do to keep them alive...
