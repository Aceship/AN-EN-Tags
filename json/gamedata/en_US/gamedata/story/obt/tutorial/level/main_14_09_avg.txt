The knight who was Victoria never forgot his duty. He streaked across the sky, picking up the golden lion who held the Realmblade.
A dull sound came from the bloodied suit of armor.
'Glorious—Victoria!'

The golden radiance pierces the red demonic eye, tearing a hole in the curtain of death above.
A miracle has happened. A legend has returned.
The hero's sword cleaved through Catastrophe, bringing golden hope that fell upon the eyes of every Victorian on the battlefield.
Londinium will yield to no storm.
As long as they have the Sighs of Kings, there is no foe they cannot overcome.
'Victoria!'
'Victoria!'
'The Exemplars! The Exemplars!'
'Vina! Vina!'
The cries form a great wave, lifting up the exhausted hero.
Siege looks up at the Sighs of Kings.
The sword in its Stone looks entirely ordinary, as though it was no more than a key.
She knows, more than ever, that the sword has never granted anyone power, nor has she suddenly become one of the heroes of legend.
She stands here now because of the countless eyes that have witnessed her, the countless hands that have lifted her up.
