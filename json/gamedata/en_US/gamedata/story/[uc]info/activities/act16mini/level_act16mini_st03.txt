The ragtag band of accomplices stops at a nomadic platform for supplies en route to the Grinning Valley. The skittish and terrified Jerry is worried that a certain someone might catch up to him after he skipped out on his engagement, and is equally scared that the security officers from the checkpoint are out to get him. During the wild chase, he happens to find himself hiding with a woman, and the two develop feelings for each other.
