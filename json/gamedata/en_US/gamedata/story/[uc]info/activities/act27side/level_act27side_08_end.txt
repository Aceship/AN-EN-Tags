The volcano is about to erupt. Dolly saves Eyjafjalla, blocking the falling rocks. Eyjafjalla finds that her mother's old protective clothing she now wears, is the answer for the 'fur.' Enis exhausts himself and passes out saving his sister. The street's pedestrians end their journey, and everyone in Siesta bids farewell to the Old Siesta.
