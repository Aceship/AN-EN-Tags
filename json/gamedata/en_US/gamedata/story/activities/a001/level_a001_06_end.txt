[name="Skadi"]   Step away from that chest. Give me the key.

[name="Carol"]   But I...
[name="Carol"]   This is something that we've safeguarded for generations. My father once said that taking care of this key was one of our most important duties—
[Character(name="char_263_skadi#2",name2="avg_npc_003",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]   —After you use that key, it will cut open your hand and drink your blood. If it comes in contact with someone not of the Kuranta bloodline, it will break.
[name="Skadi"]   Hand the key over to me!
[Character(name="avg_npc_003")]
[name="Carol"]   I can't... This key holds the future of everyone in the village.
[Character(name="char_220_grani#1")]
[name="Grani"]   Ugh...
[name="Grani"]   Is that true, Skadi?
[Character(name="char_263_skadi#2",name2="char_220_grani#1",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]   The person who hid the Knight's Treasure took drastic measures in order to protect their secrets. Only—
[Character(name="avg_npc_003")]
[name="Carol"]   —Only those who possess the true, dauntless bloodline of Kazimierz may open the path.

[name="Carol"]   Although I knew I would have to make some sort of sacrifice to open the chest, I didn't expect it to be like this.
[Character(name="char_220_grani#1")]
[name="Grani"]   ...
[Character(name="avg_npc_003")]
[name="Carol"]   But I've already made up my mind for the sake of everyone in the village. I must open this chest!
[name="Carol"]   Grani, if something happens to me, please sell the treasure and distribute the money among the villagers!

[Character(name="avg_npc_003")]
[name="Carol"]   Huh?
[Character(name="char_220_grani#3")]
[name="Grani"]   Carol, can I see that key real quick?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003")]
[name="Carol"]   Um... sure.
[Character(name="char_220_grani#3")]
[name="Grani"]   This key isn't that big, is it?
[Character(name="char_263_skadi#2",name2="char_220_grani#1",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]   Even though it's not too big, the average person won't be able to survive losing this much blood.
[Character(name="char_220_grani#1")]
[name="Grani"]   In other words, this monstrous key only sucks out a fixed amount of blood?
[Character(name="char_220_grani#1")]
[name="Grani"]   Carol,
[Character(name="char_220_grani#3")]
[name="Grani"]   I'll open the chest.

[name="Skadi"]   What?!

[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=10, ystrength=12, vibrato=30, randomness=30, fadeout=true, block=true)]

[Character(name="char_220_grani#2")]
[name="Grani"]   It's okay.
[name="Grani"]   Sorry, Carol.

Months later...

(Letter from Big Bob)
Good day.
Bob here.
I'm writing this letter to you from a manor in the outskirts of Columbia.
We've all been doing well. Even though some problems never go away as the Infected, just being able to live with the sun shining upon our faces is more joy than we could ever have imagined.
Thanks to the kindness of Grani and a little girl named Carol, who decided to leave us with the remainder of the treasure after repairing their village, I was able to settle down peacefully with my brothers.
We already have everything we need to be self sufficient, and we're even planning to try growing hops.
This was all made possible by that Dewville treasure.
That, of course, is an entirely different story. Real interesting. But, I won't go into the details here.
I've also slightly changed my views about some things.
And I know that you've long held your own opinions about this too. Just know that Reunion is not the only place that the Infected can go.
I know you'll be able to make the decision that is right for you.
I miss you a lot. I hope that I will see you in Columbia one day.


Bob
