[name="Carol"]   Ah, um, sorry...
[name="Carol"]   ...
[name="Carol"]   It's hard to tell from your outfit, but...
[name="Carol"]   Excuse me, are you... the knight from Kazimierz... who was recently anointed?
[name="Carol"]   After you save our village... Will you make us pay tribute?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#3",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   No, no. I'm not actually a knight, nor am I even from Kazimierz.
[name="Grani"]   Even though Victoria does have knights, I was actually just a member of the Mounted Police!
[name="Grani"]   Unlike the knights, our only job is to maintain public security. We don't ask for any payment in our line of duty, so of course we wouldn't tax you!
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#3",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Victoria?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#3",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   It's the land that lies beyond Kazimierz. My ancestors were actually all Kurantas who moved there from Kazimierz.
[name="Grani"]   I came after receiving your village's request for aid. I also wanted to see what my parents' homeland was like, but... I didn't expect the situation to be so dire.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#3",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   ...Sending those pleas for help... felt like leaving messages in the bottle.
[name="Carol"]   We're used to most non-governmental organizations ignoring us because we're in such a remote location...
[Character(name="char_220_grani#4")]
[name="Grani"]   I wonder, why didn't the Kazimierz government send out any assistance?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#4",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]  Hmph... Why would those high-and-mighty knights even bother coming all the way out here?
[name="Carol"]  Even without their help, we've lived here peacefully for many years. The hustle and bustle of the city simply has no appeal for us.

[name="Carol"]   Over the last few years, the villages around here have become the bounty hunters' stomping grounds.
[name="Carol"]   I heard that a region in the northern part of Kazimierz has been in turmoil, and that has attracted hordes of bounty hunters looking to strike it rich. Apparently, the only way to get up north runs right by our village.
[name="Carol"]   In the past, plenty of bounty hunters used to pass through, but they never caused any problems.
[name="Carol"]   But about a month ago, some bounty hunters dug up a knight's sarcophagus from these mountains. They even found a small chest of gold coins...

[name="Grani"]   Gold coins with the Kazimierz crest on them, like these?
[showitem(image="item_act1_1")]
[name="Grani"]   Those bounty hunters tried to pick a fight with me as soon as I arrived. I relieved them of these coins as compensation for their rudeness.
[hideitem]
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#3",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Mhm... these are the same coins. Our troubles began when a certain saying began to circulate among the bounty hunters.
[name="Carol"]   "The ancient Knights of Kazimierz were all buried with their riches near the lands they once called home. Their souls protect these unmarked graves for all of eternity."
[name="Carol"]   "Only those who fear not sacrifice and possess the true, dauntless bloodline of Kazimierz may open the path."
[name="Carol"]   Rumors such as these keep spreading, and more and more bounty hunters have been drawn here.
[name="Carol"]   At first, all they used to do was discuss where to look for the next big find. But for some reason, they soon started spreading the idea that the villagers knew where the treasures were buried...
