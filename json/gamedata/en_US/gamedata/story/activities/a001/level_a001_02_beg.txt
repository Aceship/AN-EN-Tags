[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#1",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   She might be my coworker...
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#4",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   But, wasn't I the one who was appointed to this job? It took me forever to pry this job from Meteorite too...
[name="Grani"]   Hrmmm... Maybe she's here on another mission?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#4",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Well, seems like the bounty hunters are retreating?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   It's now or never. This is our chance to get out of the village.
[name="Grani"]   If there are other operators coming to the village, we might even have the upper hand.
[name="Grani"]   Carol, the staircase is really dark. You should hold on to me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_003")]
[name="Carol"]   Grani! What's going on—
[Character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="char_220_grani#1",focus=1)]
[name="Violent Bounty Hunter"]   Everyone, shut up! Shhhh!
[Character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="char_220_grani#1",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   ...Shush?
[Character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="char_220_grani#1",focus=1)]
[name="Bounty Hunter"]   Yeah, you peasants couldn't possibly understand. Did you not see that walking Catastrophe?!
[name="Bounty Hunter"]   No bounty hunter would be stupid enough to face her head-on! The only people foolish enough to swagger up to her are those who haven't seen her level entire cities!
[Character(name="avg_npc_008",name2="char_220_grani#1",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   Wow, did she really! You mean she can do that all by herself—
[Character(name="char_220_grani#1",name2="avg_npc_007",focus=2)]
[name="Violent Bounty Hunter"]   Quiet, don't let her hear us!
[Character(name="char_220_grani#1",name2="avg_npc_007",focus=1)]
[name="Grani"]   You know, I was hoping she'd notice me—
[Character(name="char_220_grani#1",name2="avg_npc_007",focus=2)]
[name="Violent Bounty Hunter"]   I said be quiet!
[Character(name="char_220_grani#5")]
[name="Grani"]   Fine, fine...
[name="Grani"]   Somehow these stories about her that are going around are even more outrageous than the ones we hear at Rhodes Island...
