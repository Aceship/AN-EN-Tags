[name="Jessica"]  Good day.
[Character(name="char_383_snsant_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]  Hey there, girl! You made it!
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1")]
[name="Closure"]  Looks like everyone's here then.
[name="Closure"]  The Engineering Department's got a special commission this time around.
[name="Closure"]  You should've already heard what happened in Sargon back there.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]  The thing about our safehouse getting attacked?
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1")]
[name="Closure"]  Righto!
[name="Closure"]  The silver lining there is that none of our operators got hurt.
[name="Closure"]  But I still think we need to install more defensive equipment in our safehouses to prevent something like that from ever happening again!
[name="Closure"]  In short, the Engineering Department purchased a brand-new batch of non-lethal defensive weapons, and all of you are here to conduct an equipment test!
[Character(name="char_383_snsant_1")]
[name="Snowsant"]  ......Eh?
[name="Snowsant"]  They purchased what...?
[name="Snowsant"]  I don't recall ever having received an itemized bill of the materials to be inspected...
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2")]
[name="Closure"]  Umm, err... The transaction was finished on-site!
[name="Closure"]  In any case, Snowsant, I need to register your work qualification certificates.
[Character(name="char_383_snsant_1")]
[PlaySound(key="$g_card_10cardsrelease")]
[name="Snowsant"]  Pressure vessel operation certification, Originium equipment usage certification, qualified safety personnel certification, high-altitude operation qualification certification, power equipment usage certification...
[name="Snowsant"]  Everything's here.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#5")]
[name="Closure"]  Excellent! I knew you'd come prepared, girl!
[name="Closure"]  Let me get that all registered.

[Character(name="char_383_snsant_1")]
[name="Snowsant"]  Alright then.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1")]
[name="Closure"]  Very good, that takes care of things. I'll come back tomorrow to bug you two~
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_096")]

[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2")]

[Character(name="char_007_closre_1")]
[name="Closure"]  They're all good. Look at the logo over here. D'you think Raythean makes shoddy products?

[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#5")]
[name="Closure"]  I got them from a merchant called Cannot. He's a very reputable guy though, so don't worry too much about that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_096")]
[name="Jessica"]  As the equipment tester... I am extremely worried.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#4")]
[name="Closure"]  There's nothing to be afraid of. This is a simple safety test, and the enemy is just a projected hologram, nothing dangerous at all.
[name="Closure"]  Besides, my Snowsant here can always bail you out with her emergency rescue equipment if anything goes wrong.

[name="Closure"]  All the defensive equipment is located on the first floor of the building, and the terminals that control them are located on the second floor.
[name="Closure"]  Jessica, you're going to play the part of an operator trying to hold off the enemy assault. Snowsant, you'll operate the auxiliary defense equipment to help her.
[name="Closure"]  Nice and easy!
[name="Closure"]  Of course, all the enemies you'll see are just holographic drones. There are no real baddies, so don't be scared!
