[Title]This unidentified caster was seen at a concert in Bachshof, leaving the scene in a hurry when the noise broke out. He has been suspected of instigating many Arts-related disturbances in the past. Many citizens reported him as the instigator of this incident.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]After I asked my first question, he continued fiddling with his Arts equipment and did not answer.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Maybe you didn't hear my question. Let me repeat myself – what were you doing at the time of the incident?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I heard you... It wasn't me.
[Narration(style="next")]He fell silent again as soon as he finished speaking. I had no other leads, so I could only keep asking.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]You know who I act on behalf of. You're just as obligated to answer my questions as if you were in the spire. Perhaps now you'd be willing to talk about why you were at the performance?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]That being the case, you should also know where my own loyalties lie in the spire. So... no comment.
[Narration(style="next")]He is extremely tight-lipped, and I can't get any useful information out of him. Just as I am about to leave, I notice something hidden behind a stack of books on the bookshelf. It seems to be... <color=#d41f1f>a figure of a certain Columbian rockstar</color>?

[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]'The Creative Aesthetics of Conjuration Arts' ...You seem to have a number of illuminating books here that I find myself rather interested in. Mind if I borrow a copy or two?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Wait, hold on! Don't touch anything–– C'mon, I-I'll answer your questions... About the music that day–– Uh, during the performance, I showed up late because I was dealing with some important matters, and by the time I got there... Uh, anyways, the situation there wasn't what I was expecting at all! Just as I was getting ready to leave, I heard that terrible noise...

[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]At the time of the incident: The subject of the interview was <color=#d41f1f>leaving angrily because the concert wasn't what he expected</color>. It is reported that the rock concert originally scheduled for that day was swapped out last minute for a classical music performance.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]As the melody shows, you were indeed preparing to leave the venue due to a last-minute change in the genre of the concert... My apologies. Did you notice anything else that might've been unusual?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I have nothing to say to you! Do you have any idea how angry I am? How much I suffered? I shelled out triple the price to get a front-row seat. I rushed over, but who knew that it had been changed to a free open-air concert? And then I get my ass reported? All because I cast Arts on my wand to make it glow that ONE time... Isn't that what Columbians do at concerts?
[Narration(style="finish")]The caster, who revealed himself to be a fan of rock and roll, slumped back into his chair. I was unable to garner any useful information from him, and closed this line of investigation.
