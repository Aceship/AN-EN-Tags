The nights spent up in the spire were always quiet, compared to the clamor of the city.
The cheers grow increasingly loud as elegantly dressed musicians leave one by one with their instruments in tow. She remains the last one in the vehicle.
'Don't be afraid, Viviana.' Someone walks over and holds her hand. 'Kazimierz and Leithanien aren't the same, but you'll get used to it.'
She nods obediently and follows the crowd out of the car.
Still, she subconsciously closes her eyes as the neon lights of the Grand Knight Territory pierce her vision.
She's never told this to anyone, but back then, it wasn't the strange new country she was so afraid of.
After all, her impression of Leithanien came solely from the window in her room, less than a square meter wide. It's hard to say that she knew the country all that well.
What she found so frightening was that the seemingly noisy evening outside might not actually be so different from the small slice of the night in her memories.

There are people sitting or standing under the trees in groups of two of three, most holding an instrument. Violins, flutes, cellos. They seem to be playing independently, but the resulting performance is a harmonious ensemble.
