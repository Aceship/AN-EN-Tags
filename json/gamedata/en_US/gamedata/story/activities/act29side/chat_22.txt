[Title]I got a tip off about strange noises at a concert in Bodenshof. The concert ended early, before I could arrive, and there was no way to track the source of the noise. However, a block away from the venue, I found a dead man of unknown identity in an abandoned house, along with another mysterious man at the scene.

[Narration]The victim's expression was calm, as though sleeping. Only upon close inspection did I notice the traces of blood by his mouth. The Arts scorch marks on his body indicate that<color=#d41f1f>he was attacked during the concert.</color>
[Dialog(delay=2, style="ask")]There is street cleaning foam on your shoes, which means you're probably not the killer... but I want to know who you are, and why you're here.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Danke, for not treating me as a criminal. I'm just a passing citizen, an honest, law-abiding man. I make my living dealing in old books and music scores. Here's my card. I was waiting for a friend at the concert.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I was taking a walk to kill the time, and before I knew it, I was here.
[Narration(style="next")]A corner of an old music score could be seen protruding from his backpack, matching his statement. <color=#d41f1f>His face was filled with fear and unease.</color> I took the creased business card, and it seemed completely ordinary, much like its owner. Nothing suspicious about it at all.

[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Sorry for bringing back bad memories, but do you remember what happened when you got here?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]Let me think...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I was near the door when I suddenly heard a screeching sound from inside... you know, the kind of noise that's been plaguing a lot of concerts lately.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I was curious about where it came from, but the sound had stopped by the time I got to the door. I pushed it open...
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")]The noise! This could be the first direct piece of evidence, but my excitement was tempered by the scene before me. Someone had died because of this. It seemed that this case was more serious than I had imagined.

[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]Please go on. Was everything here exactly as it is now, or was there anything different?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]The man was lying on the ground at the time. My knees buckled the moment I saw it; they just wouldn't stop shaking. As for any differences... I can't swear to it, but looked like he had some sort of wind instrument in his hand at first.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Then I blinked, and it was gone. Oh, and I think... I think I saw a figure flash across my vision... but could it be? Man, I'm really not the brightest match in the box...

[Narration(style="submit")]The subject passed through this area by chance at the time of the incident, <color=#d41f1f>and approached this place out of curiosity.</color> He was <color=#d41f1f>shocked</color> by what he saw behind the door. Recreate his emotions at the time with the proper music of the heart. <color=#d41f1f>Perhaps fear and desire of wisdom is appropriate.</color>
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.

[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]The melody reveals that... wait, why does everything seem so ethereal? These emotional experiences are faked. You've received training in this area. Who are you?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]...No need to be alarmed, friend. I needed to know what you're capable of, and make sure you're really who I think you are. Don't worry, I'm here to do my job, just like you. You don't need to be wary, and I'm not deceiving you.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]The man on the ground is who you're looking for, the culprit behind the noise. Whoever it was that grabbed the stuff from right under my nose was a quick one. I didn't catch his face, but I did notice what seemed to be the emblem of Ludwigs-Universität on his robes. Maybe you can make something of it.
[Narration(style="finish")]The man put up his hood and left. The light shining through the door revealed a golden stamp on the business card in my hand. That was all I learned at the scene. I headed to Ludwigs-Universität first thing the next morning.
