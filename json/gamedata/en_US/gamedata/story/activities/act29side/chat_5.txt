[Title]Frau Laudehr seemed to be an ordinary citizen. Informants reveal that she often showed up at performances, but stayed on the lawn away from the audience. She was present when the noise occurred. Perhaps she witnessed something, or perhaps...

[Narration]She stood on the lawn with her hands on her hips, not bothering to hide her annoyance.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Sorry to bother you, Frau Laudehr. Did you notice anything unusual at the time of the incident?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]No, no! It's always the same. Nothing unusual ever happens.
[Dialog(delay=0.5, style="answer")]I can't believe he drew so many people with his level of playing. If you ask me, it's a good thing that the noise drove the crowd away. They should spend their time listening to Wagner instead...
[Narration(style="next")]She kept going on and on. I had to change the topic and try to get a picture of her actions on that day.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Perhaps I can help you recall the details. Do you remember what you were doing at the time?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]I was tending to the lawn. I do this once a week, cleaning out the weeds, keeping the grass at the right height, making sure it's smooth and soft...
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]This is an art, but those bastards just trample upon it without the slightest respect.
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")] <color=#d41f1f>She furrowed her brow</color> at this.

[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]Trampling upon the lawn... did it happen on the day of the concert? Who were they?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]That was the day when they came on the lawn and trampled my work. No respect at all!
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]Then the noise began, and I took the chance to pick up my hose and point it towards them...
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]The subject was tending to the lawn at the time of the incident. <color=#d41f1f>She was obsessed with creating the perfect lawn</color>, and <color=#d41f1f>entered into an argument</color> with those who stepped on it.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you were arguing with someone at the time, filling your heart with anger. Do you remember anything about them?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]I... I remember. They were telling me to leave the public lawn and not to get in the way of citizens who want to rest on it. They called themselves the Gendarmerie, but they knew nothing.
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]The poor lawn, trampled by so many people. I must take up the responsibility of trimming the lawn and make it beautiful again...
[Narration(style="finish")]The kind-hearted Frau Laudehr spent the rest of the interview mourning for the lawn. No useful information was garnered from her, and this line of investigation was closed.
