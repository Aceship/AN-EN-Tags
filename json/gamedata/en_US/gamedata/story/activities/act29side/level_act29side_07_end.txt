[name="Viviana"]The Witch King.

She recalls the historical novel <i>Die Glut</i>.
When the Witch King first ascended to the throne, he gave his builders a blueprint of the Genesis Spire, a monument so great, the likes of which Leithanien had never seen.
Simply gazing upon the plans was enough to make one short of breath, as though standing before its foundation.
The Witch King was scrupulous about every last detail of the Genesis Spire, down to the materials and paints used for every fence and railing, which must never fade in color.
It would become the sole symbol of Leithanien.
