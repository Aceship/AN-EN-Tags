[Title]
Fischer was a gendarme of Lutonshof. He claimed to have caught the agitator causing the noises red-handed at the charity concert at the factory area, but the well-prepared perpetrator managed to escape. He intended to request additional men for the investigation because of this.

[Narration]I waited ten minutes before he finally finished his conversation and gave a cursory salute to the envelope in my hand, never once looking me directly in the eye.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]I came regarding the matter we discussed earlier. Can you describe the agitators in detail?
[Dialog(delay=2, style="answer")]Was I not clear enough? It was a Witch King cultist who wielded powerful Arts, which allowed him to escape. These commotions were clearly carefully planned. There is nothing else I can reveal, because I have my own investigation to conduct, Herr Detective.
[Narration(style="next")]He straightened his collar and prepared to leave. The authorities paying increasing attention to the Witch King's remnants has led many low-level Gendarmerie to see catching cultists as a chance for promotion, playing up even the slightest rumor.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]There's another question. How did you find the agitator?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]H-How? Ahem... he was hiding in the crowd, fiddling with his Arts under his dirty robes, making sacrilegious sounds.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]He might fool the others, but he could never fool me! He wouldn't have gotten away if I were even a little faster!
[Narration(style="next")]There was clear anxiety in his eyes. <color=#d41f1f>He was unprepared for my questions.</color>
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Can you describe the chase and capture?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I... I chased after him while guarding against his Arts. He tried everything to stop my progress, but I charged forward with no regard for my own safety. Then he... yes, he turned all of a sudden, and hid himself in... where was it...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Listen, I don't have time for this. I need to get on this case right now!
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]At the time of the incident, the subject may have been <color=#d41f1f>chasing an agitator</color> as he claimed, but he was definitely <color=#d41f1f>dreaming about a bright future for himself.</color>
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you were thrilled about the bright future waiting for you. Could it have affected your performance in the chase? A little investigation should reveal the truth.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Wait! Please, wait! We can talk about it... as long as you don't tell anyone else.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I... I was chasing a thief, not a Witch King cultist, and he got away. I couldn't... you understand, don't you? I trust you... just continue your investigation and pretend nothing happened. Deal?
[Narration(style="finish")]I ignored his pleading and reported his false reporting to the Gendarmerie. No useful information was garnered from him, and this line of investigation was closed.
