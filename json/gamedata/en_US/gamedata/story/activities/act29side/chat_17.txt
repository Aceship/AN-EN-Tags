[Title]Baron Lange is a noble of Zwillingstürme. At the time of the incident, he was seen holding hands with his female companion near the source of the noise. Perhaps he noticed something and decided to look into it, but he insisted that he had never been there in the first place.

[Narration]He slaps the table vigorously, his features compressing in rage, almost as if flames were ready to burst from his eyes. This happened right as his wife walked into the house.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]There's no need to be so upset. I only care about the case at hand... In order to clear your good name, can you please tell us what you were doing at the time?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Of course! But I'm warning you now – you know what will happen if you dare slander a noble. Dear, fetch me my notebook, would you? Let's take a look... that evening... Ah, I was a guest at Vizegraf Giffey's spire, so he can vouch for me. Is there anything else?
[Narration(style="next")]Vizegraf Giffey and Baron Lange are on very good terms, but the Vizegraf was not in Zwillingstürme that day. These are photos of his family on the bookshelf. Among them, <color=#d41f1f>the young woman here seems to match the description of the female companion in the intel</color>.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]You two are such a perfect match, I can't help but want to learn more about your family. Meine Dame, if you don't mind... who is the beautiful young lady in this photo?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]What does that have to do with your case–– Ah, of course, dear, I'm not mad... She's my daughter's etiquette teacher and comes by three times a week. That day... was indeed one of the days she came. She left right after the lesson ended... How am I supposed to know where she went?
[Narration(style="next")]I notice a bouquet of light blue flowers in a vase on his desk. They are a seasonal specialty of Kreis Erdenherre, and are extremely rare in Zwillingstürme. <color=#d41f1f>The organizer of the concert only had them brought over recently, to contribute to the atmosphere of the venue</color>.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Truly, I thought wrongly of you, Your Excellency. You are a thoughtful man indeed. Flowers of this variety are hard to come by in the Einwald region. Did you find these just for your wife?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]These... Ah, yes. My wife enjoys gardening and such as a hobby, which I always keep in mind. As for the flowers, I specifically brought... Er, had Vizegraf Giffey bring them over. You certainly have quite refined tastes.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]At the time of the incident: Baron Lange was appreciating the moving performance along with his daughter's etiquette teacher. <color=#d41f1f>Even as passions ran wild, he did not forget to pluck some of the nearby flowers</color>.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Just as the melody shows, you picked these flowers that night, held hands with the etiquette teacher, and enjoyed the performance. Do you recall the scene now?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Dear, it's not what you think! Nina and I are just friends! Sh-She's like a sister to me. What happened at the concert was just an accident... that strange noise occurred, and I was worried she would be frightened, so I grabbed her hand and led her away... Where are you going? Let me explain...
[Narration(style="finish")]Baron Lange's wife slammed the door and stormed out, and the Baron continued sighing. I was unable to garner any useful information from him, and closed this line of investigation.
