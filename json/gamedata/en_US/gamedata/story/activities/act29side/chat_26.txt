[Title]It has been three days since I started working with Micha. Both of our investigations have stalled. Today, out of nowhere, I heard from him that he found the room where one of the concert victims had resided. I immediately made my way there.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]Micha had arrived before me, and he ran into remnants of the Witch King, who were infiltrating the room to look for something. After a confrontation, the remnants managed to escape. Fortunately, Micha was unhurt.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Do you remember what happened? ...Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. You should rest first.
[Dialog(delay=2, style="answer")]I appreciate the concern, but I'm not the sort of person who would be so easily frightened just by running into some remnants. Here's what happened. I pushed the door open, and a group of them rummaging through the boxes and shelves all looked at me before flinging all kinds of Arts and evil melodies at me...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Anyway, after the confrontation, they all got away.
[Narration(style="next")]He made light of the events that transpired and completely omitted his own actions. His descriptions are not enough for me to go on.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Uh... Is that all? Did you find out anything else, like what they were looking for? Or, would you be able to elaborate more on what happened?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]I searched the entire room after they left. Aside from daily necessities, I found only a broken piano and a few leafs of sheet music that you can buy just about anywhere. There's nothing special here. Even if there were, they must've taken it away.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]...Given your skills, couldn't you have investigated that for yourself?
[Narration(style="next")]Evidently, he isn't very willing to discuss what he did at the time. <color=#d41f1f>The room shows no signs of an intense battle.</color>
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]To be frank, in order to investigate, I must first understand the emotions of my target and the intentions behind their actions. From the looks of it, there wasn't much of a fight here, and your tuba appears to be in fair shape...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Alright, alright. I understand. I'll tell you... When I came in, uh... two of the remnants inside the house spotted me, and they both had weapons.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I... I'm more used to dealing with Arts than blades. That's why I went with the most reliable strategy, and immediately left and pretended to call for the Gendarmerie. By the time I came back, they were all gone.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Is that detailed enough to satisfy you?
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]At the time of the incident, to <color=#d41f1f>gather information,</color> the target arrived in the room, and <color=#d41f1f>chose to temporarily withdraw</color> when he encountered the Witch King's remnants.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]The melody shows that the moment you pushed the door open, the remnants were not searching aimlessly. They were... checking the piano!
[Dialog(delay=2, style="answer")]My bad, I missed that. Judging from its condition, it wasn't torn apart recklessly. It was disassembled with a goal in mind... And here it is. There's a small hole in here. This shape... Do you still have the Arts device you mentioned...? So it really is the key.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Remnants... Hochberg... Sturmland... Murder! Grimmacht was telling the truth...
[Narration(style="finish")]In a secret compartment of the piano, we found a music sheet and a cipher used to decode the notes. This is the secret message they were trying to transmit. The decoded information left me startled. When I heard the envoy mention the Kaiserin's name, I immediately turned around, only for him to be nowhere to be seen.
