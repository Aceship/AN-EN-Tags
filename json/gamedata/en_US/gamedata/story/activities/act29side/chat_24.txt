[Title]The investigation into the evidence has produced results. The Arts device in question was a modified pocket flute characteristic to the region, able to emit a number of harsh sounds at a constant pitch. Its base is only popular in a small area in Sturmland. This was already enough to confirm that the victim was connected to Sturmland, but the following the discovery came an even greater shock. I have to return to Ludwigs-Universit√§t once more, to look for Lessing.

[Narration]He was sitting by the flower bed, fastening straps around his sword layer by layer, with a serene expression on his face as if he is waiting for me to speak.
[Dialog(delay=2, style="ask")]Within days, there have been as many as seven murders across the city, the victims all related to the Kreis Sturmland. The crime scenes were almost all near the concert where the incident occurred. You're familiar with the situation... Listen, I have to stop the murderer from striking again. Please tell me whatever you know.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I can't reveal anything more to you. These things don't interest me anymore. Go back.
[Narration(style="next")]After saying this, he forcefully tightens the bindings in his hands.

[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Why? You clearly don't want to see anyone harmed because of this. Otherwise, you wouldn't have reacted the way you did back then... What caused the change of heart?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]You simply read me wrong. There are too many beneath the spires that cannot save themselves, and I have no obligation to keep each and every one of them safe. Also... my old man back home doesn't like it when I get involved in these things, and I need to consider his feelings.
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]However, there is an envoy who's been quite active recently. He's been keeping a close eye on every move in the city for his master, so surely he's noticed something.
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")]He suddenly sets down the straps in his hands and lifts his head to look at me. A certain glimmer of light shines in the depths of his clear blue eyes, <color=#d41f1f>and it suddenly occurs to me that he might be hinting at something...</color>

[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]May I ask where you met him? And... what were you doing at the time?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]Yesterday, in Josefgartenshof. I was running some errands for my old man, fetching a few borrowed books from the spire. Ran into some trouble, but took care of it pretty quick.

[Narration(style="submit")]When meeting the envoy: The subject was <color=#d41f1f>retrieving borrowed books from Josefgartenshof and ran into some trouble</color>.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]As the melody shows, everything you've said is true... Thank you.
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]No problem. It's been clear to me since the last time we met that you've chosen to take on responsibilities you had no obligation to... Now that you've made your decision, it's time to follow-through, and that is by no means meaningless.
[Narration(style="finish")]In his open heart, I see the envoy's figure. I immediately rush over to Josefgartenshof without even saying goodbye.
