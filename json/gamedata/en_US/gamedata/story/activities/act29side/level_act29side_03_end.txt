Baron Peter Lukas turns seventy-three this year.
He inherited his title from his uncle three years ago. Six months later, he moved to Karl Schmidt Street due to the expenses of maintaining the Lukas family spire.
He enjoys Karl Schmidt's music, but hates the street.
He finds the sunlight, the flowers, the youth's graffiti, and the jazz music coming from the nearby bar unbearable.
He orders his servant to close the curtains, turns on the gramophone, and the room is immediately filled with the sound of cello.
The Sankta was a truly talented musician, he thinks. So talented, he could almost forgive her for being Lateran.
He plays eleven instruments, ten of which he learned during the reign of the Witch King.
To send the best melodies into the Genesis Spire, talented young musicians were put into a room and made to compose day and night.
He loved the violinist, her delicate fingers, and the beauty mark on the edge of her palm.
Tears flowed down his face when he visited Victoria for the first time and heard music from his homeland on the stage of the Royal Theater. He kissed her for the first time.
That was his elegant, dignified Leithanien.
He misses it.
