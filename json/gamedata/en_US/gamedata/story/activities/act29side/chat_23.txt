[Title]I had a fruitless day at Ludwigs-Universität. By dusk, as I was ready to call it a day when a stern-looking youth approached me and claimed to be the one I was looking for. I decided to talk to him.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]I followed him through the campus. The only thing he told me along the way was his name: Lessing. He stood in stark contrast to his peers, who had been rather excitable and hot-headed of late. We went into a room in one of the spires.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Can you describe what you saw at the incident?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]I didn't observe the attack. I arrived at the scene almost at the same time as a secret agent. We both saw the same thing, so there's nothing new that I can tell you.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I was a step too late... things unfolded quicker than I expected.
[Narration(style="next")]He blinked, wiping away a subtle hint of an unusual expression. He said things unfolded quicker than he expected. <color=#d41f1f>Was he expecting the noise to appear again at the concert?</color>
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Sorry, but there's something bothering me. I'm just going to be straight with you... how did you know where the culprit who made the noise was? It's hard to believe that you're just an ordinary student.
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]Noise? I see... so you don't understand its true nature. That sound has its own internal logic, and there seems to be a message within its music.
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]The sound has frequently appeared wherever people were gathered. I'm focused on the meaning behind it... Also, I never said I was a student. I'm just studying with a professor here.
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")]An internal logic? I did not have any recordings with which I could verify that statement, but it would be a crucial lead if true. But he had yet to mention the item that he removed from the scene. I had to act with care and work out his intentions before prying any further.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]Thank you, this has been really helpful... Now, is there anything else that you haven't told me about the crime scene?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]This is what you're looking for. An intricate musical Arts device with Originium circuits that greatly magnify the volume of the user's playing, allowing the sound to travel further... Yes, it's a key piece of evidence that cannot be allowed to fall into the wrong hands, especially not that secret agent's.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]The subject was <color=#d41f1f>frustrated that he did not arrive at the scene on time. He removed the victim's Arts device from the scene in order to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.</color> Recreate his emotions with the proper music of the heart. <color=#d41f1f>Perhaps regret and worldly desire is appropriate.</color>
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you blame yourself for not arriving on time to save the victim... Trust me, I understand, and I don't want something like this to happen again either. I must discover the truth.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Very well, you can take the device. But I recommend staying out of this case once you've discovered the truth you're looking for. And don't play that trick on me again; it makes my head hurt.
[Narration(style="finish")]He spoke no more and showed me out. I left Ludwigs-Universität and began to investigate the evidence I obtained from him.
