A standoff.
It was meant to be a sudden assault. The casters of Kreis Heldenschwert would disguise themselves as musicians and infiltrated the Witch King's Spire, while the armies from Erdenherre and Sturmland would stay hidden outside through their enchantments.
No one dared underestimate the Witch King's power, but the battle was nonetheless harder than anyone could have imagined.
The army outside the Spire was discovered by the Einwald Imperial Guard. The first wave of casters all died at its base, while the second wave was swallowed by the endless staircase.
The only ones who made it to the throne were the Twins. Grimmacht, and her sister, Ewigegnade.
Black and red had always been the Urtica colors, but from the entrance to its deepest innards, the Spire was almost completely void of black tiles.

A melody, so impassioned that it approaches piercing, rings out from the strings of Arturia's cello.

As though motivated by the music, black Originium flames rise from the deepest depths of the earth and tear asunder the surface mere inches away.
The Witch King's musicians standing guard at the foot of the spire all walk single file into the black flames, chanting even as they are incinerated into ash.
[name="'Witch King's Echo'"]The very Spire that holds up the skies, the inevitable, indispensable, and eternal pillar—
[name="'Witch King's Echo'"]Now rise!
Something bores out of the earth's flesh.
It is a high spire.
It bears a red tint to its blackness, a spiral shape, and a strange sharpness.
The long lost Witch King's Spire stands atop the land once more.
