[Title]Rauch is a flower vendor who often wanders the streets and was at the concert. Perhaps she noticed something unusual, but there were also rumors that she was missing a few screws, as it were. Any information obtained from her must be treated with care.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]She stood before a blooming wall of flowers, a flower basket in hand, seemingly waiting for someone.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Excuse me, do you remember anything about what happened at the time of the incident? Did you see anything unusual?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Pardon me, sir, but my eyes can no longer see your face, or whatever is reflected in your eyes. That concert was no different from any other in Leithanien, the music blossoming like the flowers on this wall.
[Narration(style="next")]Only then did I notice a shadow like a mist shrouding her eyes. Her blindness has gone unnoticed as she showed no sign of incapacitation. I was about to leave, but I felt a remarkable aura from her that compelled me to continue asking.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Could you try to remember if there was anything unusual? Even just a sound?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I was tending to the flowers that day. There are many flowers here, every one beautiful... no need to be anxious. Perhaps there is one here that will catch your eye.
[Narration(style="next")]She lifted her flower basket, and the flowers inside smiled at me. For some reason, I found my gaze drawn to a <color=#d41f1f>golden flower</color>.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Do you... remember what you were doing? Maybe I can help you remember.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]A couple bought the last flower in my basket, a rose filled with love. The joyful rose bloomed on their faces. My basket was empty, so I looked around. Oh... it was him...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]A flower emerged from the bushes, but he was wilting. I felt tears streak across my cheeks...
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]The subject used flowers as analogy for her psychological state. <color=#d41f1f>She saw a wilting flower and wept for it.</color>
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you discovered a special truth and felt sad about it. Do you remember anything more specific?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]A golden flower, swaying in the storm far away. Branches wilt and flowers fall. The time has come, and he no longer hears the call...
[Narration(style="finish")]I bought the marigold from the flower vendor. Perhaps there was a deeper meaning behind her words, but I could not decipher it.
