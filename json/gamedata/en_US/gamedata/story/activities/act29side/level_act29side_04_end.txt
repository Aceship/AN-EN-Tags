There are more and more pursuers by the second. Shoes of various ages step on the stairs, each producing a different sound.
The pipes that form the spire's walls are vibrating even more powerfully now. The sound of the organ and the footsteps blend together to form a unique piece, with the squads meandering up the spiral staircase as the performers.
At the front, Federico maintains a steady pace through the entire process. Even his heartrate remains unchanged.
His eyes do not see any of the pursuing soldiers. All he can see is the target before him. A decade has passed, but as though only a day has gone by, nothing has changed.
The last floor.

[name="Gerhard"]I was gravely injured during the final battle, and spent the better part of a year in a confused state. It was Professor Fremont who spent the time and effort to cure me.
[name="Gerhard"]That day, when I finally woke up from my nightmare of being bound to those blood-red steps, the first thought that entered my mind was that... my classmates, friends, and even my lover were all gone.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1124_1#3$1",focus="r")]
[name="Gerhard"]He gave me a number of books on the G√ºldenesgesatz. He told me that whenever I can't answer my own questions, history can.
[name="Gerhard"]So I started studying the G√ºldenesgesatz, how Leithanien came to be, and the direction it should go. I researched these topics for twenty years.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$1",focus="l")]
[name="Ebenholz"]And... what answer did you come to?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1124_1#3$1",focus="r")]
[name="Gerhard"]The problems facing Leithanien have always existed, ever since the birth of the G√ºldenesgesatz. The cultural differences between tribes, the rift between nobles and commoners, etc. All these have existed for over a thousand years.
[name="Gerhard"]History has proven how difficult it is to change Leithanien, to give its citizens new lives, and to end the endless sacrifices.
[name="Gerhard"]You must possess both absolute power and unbreakable resolve.
[name="Gerhard"]Luckily, such power wasn't completely lost, and we're on our way to find it right now.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$1",focus="l")]
[name="Ebenholz"]So this power you speak of is hidden somewhere on this old campus?

[name="Gerhard"]Ja.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Ebenholz"]And by obtaining it, we'll be able to resolve the predicament before us, eliminate the threat of the Witch King's remains, and... change my fate, all at the same time?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1124_1#8$1",focus="r")]
[name="Gerhard"]It was only my confidence in it that gave me the courage to go against my teacher.

[name="Gerhard"]A thousand years ago, sages from the various tribes came together and signed an alliance, witnessed by an all-powerful, immortal caster.

[name="Gerhard"]That is, until a century ago, when the Siracusans became the first to turn their backs on the G√ºldenesgesatz and seek independence from Leithanien.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1124_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Gerhard"]It was... a bloody conflict, lasting several years. With one part of the choir gone, the Movement became destabilized, and many regions fell into chaos. Leithanien was on the brink of collapse.
[name="Gerhard"]In those dire circumstances, a man stepped forward.
[name="Gerhard"]He realized that the G√ºldenesgesatz had to be amended. Only by removing Siracusa from the score entirely could the reborn movement unite the nine remaining regions.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#9$1",focus="l")]

'Graf Urtica.'
Many years ago, he woke up to find himself shackled to that chair. In the ten years since, he was granted this name.
He never wanted the title of Graf, and he despised the name Urtica more than anything. Even the name Franz, an old-fashioned name used by countless noble children, is something he has always loathed.
In that spire standing tall in the center of the Urtica Grafschaft, he tried to escape that chair again and again. After all, it was never him that the nobles reporting on the affairs of the Grafschaft truly cared about.
They knew each other well, which is why the guards only ever came early in the day, to drag him from the curtains to the chair.
After a long time, he would finally be allowed to roam the spire aimlessly. Not even the guards noticed him then, until the next morning arrived.
The days went by in that vicious cycle.

If he hadn't tried to run even farther afield, hadn't thought about the other person suffering a similar fate, hadn't tried to resist, and hadn't been shown any hope whatsoever...
Then perhaps he would have been bound to that chair his entire life.
But then, today, he finds himself caught once again. And behind him is yet another familiar chair.
Its shadow is simple, elegant, and entwined with thorns. At a single glance, it feels as if his eyes, brain, and heart have been pierced with intense pain.
Even the cheers around him are similar.
