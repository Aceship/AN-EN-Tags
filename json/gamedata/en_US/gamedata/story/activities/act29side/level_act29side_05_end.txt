They said that during the Battle of the Four Emperors, Herkunftshorn brought an Originium storm that ripped apart the skies above the battlefield, swallowing an entire Gaulish landship fleet at once.
And now, at that very same location, there remains a terrifying rift deep in the Catastrophe clouds, the screams of the sleepless dead reverberating within.

[name="Fremont"]Hohoh, what is there to think about? The school was burnt down by Herkunftshorn's embers. I could miss it all I want, but that wouldn't bring it back.
[name="Fremont"]I've forgotten... How long have I been in Leithanien? Five hundred years? Longer?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1114_1#8$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fremont"]When I first got here, there was nothing. No nomadic cities, no spires, no nobles. Hah, back then, everyone lived in the forests by the lakes. They lit fires to eat, and used rocks to shelter from the wind.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1115_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Grimmacht"]To us, a few decades are more than though for a city to rise and fall, a man to go from young to old, or a pair of close companions to have a falling out and go their separate ways.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1114_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fremont"]That's right. It's been but an instant since this place went from Vedunien to Zwillingstürme. I wonder what the city will be called next.
[name="Fremont"]And when that lamb with the rotten luck and a brain full of nothing but melodies is taken care of, I'll fulfill my promise to you. After that, I think I'll take a stroll around town.

[name="Grimmacht"]I've already explained it to them, long ago.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1114_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fremont"]Explained what? That Liches aren't like Vampires and don't get involved with Military Commission business, so they can rest easy that this place won't be the next Londinium?
[name="Fremont"]Do you really believe they simply don't understand, Grimmacht?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1114_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fremont"]And are you really so whimsically unaware of who stands behind those nobles that want to chase the Liches out?

[name="Grimmacht"]......
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1114_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fremont"]You two can deal with the fallout afterwards.
[name="Fremont"]The Liches have indeed stayed here for far too long. Knowledge should never have taken the side of any one nation or race.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1114_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fremont"]Do you even know how many Leithanian terms our brats use in their writing these days? It's absolutely outrageous!
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1114_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fremont"]We should've left when Herkunftshorn bought the farm.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1114_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fremont"]This... is just a belated farewell.

The white-haired Lich lifts his hand.
As though having been granted permission, a large number of slender silhouettes appear beneath the setting sun.
Perhaps they'd been standing there the whole time. They were simply masquerading as ordinary students and faculty. However, from this moment onwards, they are no longer concerned with how different they are from other Leithanians.
The Liches all raise their hands.
Countless paper-thin strands of silk extend from their bodies and into the dark clouds up above.
Then, a radiance like starlight comes falling down. Looking up, many of the students see the sunset, the night, and the sunrise all at once.
Within that brimming radiance, the dark flames on the earth are extinguished without a sound. Not long after, the silk-threaded shadows also disappear into the dream-like rain.
Ever since, no more trace of the Liches could be found in Leithanien's spires.
