[Title]Herr Lindner is the owner of a cafe, which was closed due to suspicions of hosting gatherings of twisted horn worshippers. He surrendered himself to the Gendarmerie, claiming to be the one who caused the noise.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]He cussed at the Gendarmerie, almost striking their noses with his finger. Care must be taken to avoid further provoking him.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Herr Lindner, perhaps we can sit down and talk about this. Why did you choose to express your dissatisfaction by disrupting the performance?
[Dialog(delay=2, style="answer")]Dissatisfaction? No, you're wrong.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Why would I be dissatisfied with our honorable Gendarmerie, and our majestic Kaiserinnen? But there were so many people at that performance, so many more than my cafe! I'm sure there were a lot of gatherings that you didn't want to see.
[Narration(style="next")]He swung his fists around with a proud look on his face. True, this was a fitting reason for him. Apparently, his son was a fervent worshipper of the twisted horns, <color=#d41f1f>and had been part of a plot to disrupt performances</color>.

[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]When was the last concert you attended?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]The Columbian rock concert last Friday in Bachshof! I gave them some accompaniment with my horn and drums! Haha!
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")] In fact, the concert was changed at the last minute to a performance to commemorate the famous architect, Bach. This was not reported in the news. Last Friday, <color=#d41f1f>there was a loud argument in the cafe</color>, which ended with his son storming out of the cafe after smashing a Columbian-made player.

[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]There was a time when your business was in a slump, until you started playing rock music and Wrankwood movies in the cafe... correct?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]I don't know anything... I don't know who did it. Maybe a customer...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]That stuff is not music! We've written so much beautiful music, music that's accompanied us our entire lives! But now...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Stop asking questions! I said I did it! What more do you want?
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]The subject was not at the scene at the time of the incident. <color=#d41f1f>He was fuming over his son's actions.</color>. Recreate his emotions with the proper music of the heart. <color=#d41f1f>Perhaps worldly desires are more suitable, given his worries about his livelihood</color>.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.

[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you were in the cafe all day. You believe that your son was responsible for the noise and wanted to take the fall for him.
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]My son... he used to be such a perfect boy... he loved watching me play the violin, and he got into the spires with top grades...
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]He saw business drop, all the young people going to rock parties at other establishments... he didn't mean to do it, he must have... he just lost his cool, that's all... please, believe me...
[Narration(style="finish")]The Gendarmerie sent Herr Lindner back to his cafe. No useful information was garnered from him, and this line of investigation was closed.
