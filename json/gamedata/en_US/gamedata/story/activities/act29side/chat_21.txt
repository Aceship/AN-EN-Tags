[Title]Lindner is an Arts spire student and fervent twisted horns worshipper. There were rumors that he was responsible for the disturbance at the Bachshof concert last week, but no concrete evidence could be found at the scene.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]I found him in an abandoned concert hall in Doppelhörnershof, where he had been hiding for days.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]I'm not here to arrest you, Lindner. I just want to chat. Can you tell me what you did at the concert?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]That sound... that sound was our proclamation—the Twin Spires will fall, and the filth from outside will be wiped away. A spire the likes of which has never been seen will stand again... the glory of Leithanien will return!
[Narration(style="next")]His voice was trembling, struggling to string together a complete sentence. <color=#d41f1f>He was clearly trying to muster his courage.</color>
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Don't be stupid. The one you're trying to call is no more. Answer my questions, and you might be able to return to the spires and study your Originium Arts. Do you understand me?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]Shut up! Herkunftshorn's eye still gazes upon Leithanien. He will not allow this vile era to continue. He will not abide the usurpers to sit upon his throne!
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]O-Our lives are but a small price to pay for his return!
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")]This called for another line of questioning. His father had been anxiously looking for him, even turning himself in to the Gendarmerie in his son's place.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]Think of your father! Did you know that he turned himself in to protect you? Tell me the truth if you don't want to watch the Gendarmerie take him away!
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]What? Father? No! What have I done... It's true that I was planning on disrupting the concert, but the performance changed at the last minute.
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]As I was wondering whether I should continue the plan, I felt someone behind me, and broke out into a cold sweat... then I remember the concert being stopped.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]The subject was planning to disrupt the concert at the time of the incident <color=#d41f1f>as a show of his blind worship</color>, but became <color=#d41f1f>frightened</color> by unexpected events.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]The melody reveals that something unexpected happened before you could put your plan into action. Do you remember anything more specific?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]I-It wasn't me! I remember now. The guy who appeared behind me cast Arts on me before I could do anything. I quickly lost consciousness and don't remember anything about him...
[Narration(style="finish")]While Lindner had intended to disrupt the concert, he was not the one who actually caused the noise. Nothing else came of the lead that I garnered from him.
