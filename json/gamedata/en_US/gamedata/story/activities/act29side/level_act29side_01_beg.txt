[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Viviana"]I hope you can keep this a secret.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1123_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Loris"]Please rest assured.
[name="Loris"]Although... this is such a small accident, so why did it spring the Kaiserin's secret envoy into action?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Viviana"]An accident? Is that the conclusion of the Gendarmerie's investigation?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1123_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Loris"]We did the forensics, and Frau Seemann did indeed die from exhaustion.
[name="Loris"]According to her attendant, she went without food or rest for multiple days on end.
[name="Loris"]I can't help but admire her spirit. Such a dedicated artist is hard to come by, even in Leithanien.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#7$1",focus="l")]
[name="Viviana"]This work must have been extremely important to her then.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1123_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Loris"]Frau Seeman has not presented a new work for more than two decades.
[name="Loris"]She then suddenly decided to work on this painting, even notifying the gallery in advance that would personally unveil it today, on the first day of the exhibition.
[name="Loris"]I'm sure you know what happened next. When the audience arrived, they were greeted only by the artist collapsing in front of her painting.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Viviana"]What about the painting itself?
[name="Viviana"]Was it... completed?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1123_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Loris"]A difficult question to answer.
[name="Loris"]You'd better see it with your own eyes. I can only say that its subject was... an unexpected surprise.

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#7$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#2$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1123_1#8$1",focus="r")]
[name="Loris"]No wonder. You may not be aware, but the fall of His Majesty is an enormously popular subject these days. Even counting operas alone, there are over a hundred depicting how the Kaiserinnen miraculously triumphed over their enemy.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#7$1",focus="l")]
[name="Viviana"]How careless of me. So the actual protagonists of these stories are Their Majesties.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1123_1#8$1",focus="r")]
[name="Loris"]Haha. In Leithanien, you're free to create anything, so... this is probably the result of the people revealing their true feelings.
[name="Loris"]Frau Seemann may have also wanted to take the celebration as a chance to add a bit of luster to this national holiday, by working with such a classic theme.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#10$1",focus="l")]
[name="Viviana"]But even so, you said her painting was an 'unexpected surprise'?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1123_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Loris"]It's up ahead, just around the corner.
[name="Loris"]Once you've had a look, I think you'll share my hope that this was just an accident.

Black and disorderly, the lines twist into infinity.
<i>Der Tod des Hexenkönigs</i> sitting at the center isn't the only thing to have those twisted lines painted over it—every other painting on the wall sports the same look.
The black spirals resemble vortices, breaking out of the frames one after another and filling the entire space.
The lines seem to twist and burrow into her eyes, erupting into a series of mournful sobs in the depths of her mind.
Her consciousness is pulled, deformed, fractured, and plunged into chaos.
Shadows sway behind Viviana. She can hardly control her Arts. She wants to preserve herself, to escape.
This terrifying power needs no concrete descriptor, image, or sound to remind anyone of what it is.
Much like its title, it forcefully crams itself directly into its audience's cognition, reflecting its very meaning into their minds—

A calm voice can suddenly be heard in the center of the exhibition hall.
The noise comes to a halt, and the black spirals retreat into the paintings.
[name="Viviana"]This painting...
[name="Viviana"]There's no obvious trace of Originium Arts... so why?
[name="Arturia"]Arts aren't the only thing that can affect the mind.
[name="Arturia"]Something need only be true enough to tug at one's heartstrings, be it a picture or a melody.
[name="Arturia"]But please, don't fear it... feel it.
[name="Viviana"]...It's very intense.
[name="Viviana"]A rich and deep emotion flows in these seemingly messy brushstrokes.
[name="Viviana"]It's... hard to keep looking.
[name="Arturia"]That's because you're looking at a person's soul.
[name="Arturia"]She put both the Witch King in her heart and her very life onto the canvas.
[name="Viviana"]Frau Seemann... What connection did she have with His Majesty?
[name="Arturia"]His death changed her entire life.
[name="Arturia"]As a young woman, she revered the man on the throne. She was in love with a symbol, a god.
[name="Arturia"]And then that god fell right before her eyes.
[name="Arturia"]She was confused, bewildered by his mortality. She lost her love, her purest emotions, and very nearly her ability to create as well.
[name="Arturia"]She was... trapped.
[name="Arturia"]And only when her life was nearing its end did she realize this.
[name="Viviana"]You speak as if you were her.
[name="Arturia"]Her innermost emotions resonated with my melody. I went into the depths of her soul and heard her cry for help.
[name="Viviana"]Cry for help?
[name="Arturia"]It's the same everywhere you go.
[name="Arturia"]Many people are trapped in whatever fateful moment changed the course of their lives, walking along an endless spiral staircase.
[name="Arturia"]Just like...
[name="Arturia"]...Your father. And you as well.
