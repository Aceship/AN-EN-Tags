Rain and wind come hand in hand with evening in Kreis Sturmland. After generations of keepers, a house spire's decrepit stairwells will always hide moss somewhere in their cracks, no matter how the casters work to keep them clean.
He thinks of Zwillingstürme. Of the time when the black spire reminiscent of twisted horns had yet to be superseded by the newly erected twin spires, when the majestic city was called by a different name.
Of the dazzling auburn alleys in autumn, the kind he'd cross through in his youth, still sans wand or dagger. Nestled in his hands were but a few bound poetry collections, and precious hopes of freedom.
Not so anymore. Though the storm briefly abates, the spire's peak is still ruinously cold. Moonlight stabs through the drapery like rain, like a nail driven through each and every hope as it springs up.
What a shame, he laments.
Never again will he see the marigold in bloom.

[name="Tired Security Guard"]No... Now that you mention it, I've never heard <i>any</i> commoner pronounce things the way you do. Say, you wouldn't happen to be the runaway son of some small-time noble, would you?

[name="Biegler"]Come on, you don't remember me? I live in the city. That second-hand bookshop guy.
[name="Biegler"]Speaking of which, the books aren't quite flying off the shelves, and lately I've been thinking, what about a cafe instead? You must be awfully tired this late on patrol, no? Here, here, try my coffee. My own brew.

[name="Ebenholz"]For the hundreds of thousands of residents of the Urtica Grafschaft. Over a hundred retainers in the spire alone. I'm not so far gone in my selfishness that I'd sacrifice them all for my so-called freedom.

[name="Biegler"]Maybe you've already realized this, but you had two correspondence. One ordering you to come to the capital, and the other granting you your official 'death.' But it wasn't the same Majesty that wrote both.
[name="Biegler"]Compared to the first's benevolence, the other...

Ebenholz doesn't even let Biegler finish before walking off.
Just before disappearing around the corner for good, the young man waves ta-ta to him.
