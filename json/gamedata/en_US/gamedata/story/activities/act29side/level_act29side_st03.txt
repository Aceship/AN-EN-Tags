The boy's family served as retainers to a certain aristocracy for generations. From one generation to the next, the retainers fought on the nobles' behalf, shedding blood, vying for glory, and bearing any rebukes for them.
Until a certain noble came along. Birth, tradition, systems... He saw them all as worthless. Everyone looked the same to him: mediocre, frail, and shallow.
So with a piece of paper, he removed the status of every retainer working for his family, and the boy's family obtained their freedom.
Afterwards, the noble became the most controversial ruler in the history of the country. His crimes eventually eclipsed his accomplishments, his Spire was toppled, and the empire ushered in a new age.
Many decisions made during his lifetime were also overruled, including the decree to remove his retainers' shackles.
One day, the young boy was told that the deposed king's descendant was granted leniency by the new Kaiser, and had regained his family's territory. He was told he needed to rush back to the spire, to meet his master...
Fate seemed to only turn a corner before coming right back again.
But in the end, the boy never managed to enter the spire. The newly arrived noble refused to sign the documents that could get him his servant back. This new noble, as they said, was also a boy around his age...
Once again, the boy obtained 'freedom.'

It is not large by any measure, but still well maintained. The low stone steps surrounding the planted vegetation have been removed and enclosed with a waxy white oak fence, presumably to prevent the homeowners from tripping over them.
A small house sits quietly in the center, embraced by the grass. Freshly painted white walls reflect the morning sun, casting the climbing vines in a radiant glow.

[name="Viviana"]But when I returned to Sturmland, to Zwillingstürme, that feeling never went away.

[name="Ewigegnade"]I asked her if she wanted to know why.
[name="Ewigegnade"]If she wanted to ask why I let everything be, even though I knew it would turn out as it did.
[name="Ewigegnade"]Or to ask me why... I turned my back on her at the very last moment.
[name="Ewigegnade"]But she didn't.
[name="Ewigegnade"]She didn't even hesitate to do what she normally does, turning to face the enemy head on.
[name="Ewigegnade"]As we passed each other, her final words were to wish that...
[name="Ewigegnade"]...I could have this sunset, as I wanted.
[name="Gesatzswächter"]Grimmacht... is a great ruler.
[name="Gesatzswächter"]We will never forget her sacrifice, and continue the fight for Leithanien's future.
[name="Ewigegnade"]So you've made your decision too.
[name="Gesatzswächter"]...Yes, Your Majesty.
[name="Ewigegnade"]Very good, Brandt.
[name="Ewigegnade"]Herkunftshorn built a spire in that impossible chaos, naming it after the tower that has long since crumbled in reality.
[name="Ewigegnade"]He declared that it would stand eternal.
[name="Ewigegnade"]Therefore, I can achieve the same. No, I can surpass it, even.
[name="Ewigegnade"]I will keep this sunset for all eternity.
[name="Ewigegnade"]It will bathe Leithanien, and everything that will belong to Leithanien, in Eternal Grace.

[name="Yvangelista XI"]The special correspondence with Ewigegnade is over. I shared Laterano's caution and, once again, offered my hopes of advancing together with Leithanien.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]When the time comes, we will further analyze the incident in Zwillingstürme according to the information brought back by Federico Giallo.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]It was clearly more than just a revolt instigated by the remnants of the Witch King.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]Perhaps what happened there was a harbinger of the Disaster, much like the warning Laterano received.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]Ewigegnade, the only Empress of Leithanien with a voice now... The way she spoke was appropriate enough, and her attitude sufficiently ambiguous. I could even imagine her expressions.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]...All within my expectations.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]The Lateran Declaration didn't really receive any practical response after the Summit of Nations. From the furthest coastlines to the centrum, the Disaster remains a secret in many countries.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]Faith unites Laterano, while division has always been an everlasting blight upon this great land. But if we wait until the Disaster connects all nations into one...
[name="Yvangelista XI"]It will be too late.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]We already have a vague outline of what we're facing, but are we still unable to deduce its source?

[name="Arturia"]This is the moment where Zwillingstürme reveals the pinnacle of its beauty. Such splendor is both fleeting and fragile. Soon, night will fall.
[name="Arturia"]Do you still remember the question you once asked me?
[name="Arturia"]Laterano seems to stand eternally white and flawless, shining with an everlasting radiance. So where is the first place to light up when the sun goes down?
[name="Arturia"]Back then, I promised you that I would bring you to the highest point in Laterano for a look.
[name="Federico"]I know the answer.
[focusout(type="cg", id="44_i18", from=1, to=0, duration=8, block=false)]
[name="Arturia"]Oh?
[name="Federico"]I went to the top of the Basilica after I met with the Pope and received my sainthood.
[name="Federico"]Once night falls in the city, the streets to the right of the Tower of Revelations will be the first to light up.
[name="Federico"]I even looked into why that is the case.
[name="Federico"]The Lateran Office of Electrical Management has an integrated program for the city's public energy grid. The area I mentioned belongs to the district where the Tower of Revelations is located.
[name="Federico"]Alcide, the operator at the management office, is left-handed and has a mild case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. He starts from the leftmost switch on the control panel everyday.
[name="Federico"]The lights start from that street to the right of the Tower of Revelations, and then through the Notarial Hall and firearm workshops in Pagus Michaelion, to the Sunset Chapel in Pagus Saint Marcel, and then all the way to the chapel square.
[name="Federico"]At night, the streetlights in Laterano illuminate in order—
[name="Arturia"]I should have expected as much. Your answer, as the most rational person I know, is also—
[name="Federico"]And they look just as nice as they were before.
