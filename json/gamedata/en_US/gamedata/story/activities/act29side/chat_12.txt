[Title]Helmut is a skilled sculptor who made statues for Das Kaiserinnensfest at Lutonshof's industrial area. He was seen acting abnormally at the scene of the concert, crying loudly, and was arrested by the Gendarmerie on suspicion of public disturbance. It was later found that he had no employment permit, adding to the suspicions surrounding him.

[Narration]He looked surprisingly calm in the Gendarmerie interrogation room.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Herr Helmut? I have a few questions. What were you doing at the time of the incident?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I was looking along the road for my lost chisel, trying to find it before the concert ended. After I heard the dissonance, the Gendarmerie appeared, saying that I looked suspicious and that they were taking me in for questioning.
[Narration(style="next")]There was no change in his expression. He came from a family of sculptors, and his grandfather was a guest at many spires, but <color=#d41f1f>the family went into decline after being rejected by high society due to their commoner status</color> following the ascendance of the Twin Empresses.

[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Looks like you could have cleared your suspicion by explaining yourself. What happened?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]They asked me what I lost. I described my chisel, adorned with garnet and obsidian, passed down to me from my father. They said someone like me couldn't possibly possess such an object, and that they were taking me away.
[Narration(style="next")]He gave a meek laughed and bowed his head. I realized that he was not so much calm as simply numb.

[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Why did you cry? Did something happen?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]No, there was no confrontation, nothing... I just saw the growing crowd and realized I might never see my chisel again.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]If I can't work, I won't get paid, which means I couldn't buy suppressants... I started crying, and the Gendarmerie arrested me.

[Narration(style="submit")]The subject was <color=#d41f1f>looking for his lost chisel</color> at the time of the incident, and <color=#d41f1f>cried when he realized he could not find it.</color>
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.

[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you had nothing to do with the noise. I sympathize with what happened to you... I'm sorry that you couldn't find what was lost.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]My chisel was a gift from a noble to my grandfather. He was the best in town.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]When the city was renamed Zwillingst√ºrme, my father was kicked out of the spires, and I was ejected by the atelier. I had to work in the shadows, like some kind of pest or vermin... I don't understand why...
[Narration(style="finish")]I secured Helmut's release, but he was a broken man. No useful information was garnered from him, and this line of investigation was closed.
