[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1122_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Yulia"]I started working there just to make ends meet. The owner was kind, letting me and Jan live in the shed behind the courtyard.
[name="Yulia"]I turned it into a proper home, and even set up a little space for Jan to practice his Arts.
[name="Yulia"]The boy is gifted, you know. We saw casters using Arts to repair sculptures on the street, and he watched for only a few moments before going home and spending the whole night turning his room into a 'sound-control' space.
[name="Yulia"]I've talked about it with Loris, and we'll send him to study Arts at Ludwigs-Universität.
[name="Yulia"]Loris intends to make a career in Zwillingstürme, and once he does, he'll give Jan a recommendation.
[name="Yulia"]Later, when this cafe was about to close down, I used all my savings to buy it for myself.
