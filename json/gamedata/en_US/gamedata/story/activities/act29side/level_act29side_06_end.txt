Amelie must have turned to dark dust before me. This is how it is for the Witch King's followers. They don't want their bodies to linger on a land that lacks Herkunftshorn's favor.

[name="Viviana"]Most of them are. The remaining resistance will not last long.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#2$1")]
[name="Cora"]...And the same for me, I suppose.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#2$1")]
[name="Viviana"]You deceived the followers of Herkunftshorn.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#9$1")]
[name="Cora"]Ja. The Kaiserin's instruction was to become the Concertmaster of the Witch King's followers. To become a hope and a lure, and to lead them into the abyss by their own volition.
[name="Cora"]It's been twenty-three years. Everything about the Witch King—the long nightmares, the deep-rooted fears, the meaningless ambition—should have been gone from this country a long time ago.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#7$1")]
[name="Viviana"]So why is the 'tuning' still going?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#2$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#3$1")]
[name="Cora"]Werner.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#2$1")]
[name="Viviana"]Did the Kaiserin order father's death?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#7$1")]
[name="Cora"]...I tried to persuade him. I tried so hard.
[name="Cora"]I wanted him to hand over the copy of Güldenesgesatz, so I could move it elsewhere, but he was concerned that the Witch King remnants would catch on, thus nullifying the bait.
[name="Cora"]I asked him if maybe Brandt could arrive at the scene earlier, and save him at the scene of the attack... but he refused.
[name="Cora"]He said he was already dying, and would soon get to see Lucinda. A few more days wasn't worth dragging both you and Sturmland into it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#8$1")]
[name="Cora"]But you'd have gotten there if only he'd held out for a few more hours... or less.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#7$1")]
[name="Viviana"]......
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#7$1")]
[name="Cora"]He was too determined to leave, and gave up too easily.
[name="Cora"]The day Werner died, I recovered the copy of the Movement and watched you return to Sturmland, walking the path paved for you, so similar to his...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#3$1")]
[name="Cora"]And I made the choice that had long been brewing in my heart.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#7$1")]
[name="Viviana"]...The Güldenesgesatz.
[name="Viviana"]You're using Herkunftshorn's Arts to tune the music. You're trying to destroy it, or rather the influence it holds over all Leithanians.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#2$1")]
[name="Cora"]They say that fate is an endless spiral staircase.
[name="Cora"]If so, the Güldenesgesatz is the staircase trapping Leithanien.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#4$1")]
[name="Cora"]Stairs built a thousand years ago, glorious and beautiful on the outside, yet rotted to the core on the inside.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#9$1")]
[name="Cora"]I've seen so many people trapped within. Herr Emmanuel, Gerhard, Frieda, Loris... and Brandt. All suffering the tidings of fate, helpless to change it.
[name="Cora"]The Witch King's Spire fell. Yet more rose to take its place. Those beneath the spires wish to climb them, while those atop them aspire to an even higher perch.
[name="Cora"]They come and go, up and down, an endless waltz of hatred and conflict. Pain, sorrow and regret, filling the souls of one generation of Leithanians after another.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#2$1")]
[name="Cora"]You too, Viviana. Once you enter the Kaiserinnen's Spires, you will only speak what they want you to.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#7$1")]
[name="Cora"]I can 'see'... I have already seen how you will be forced to live a life you don't want, just like your father before you.
[name="Cora"]The Güldenesgesatz never changes. Leithanien never changes. Tragedy never changes.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#3$1")]
[name="Cora"]Unless we free ourselves from the Movement of the past.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#2$1")]
[name="Viviana"]You say you want to change our fate. But who are you to decide who gets saved, and who gets sacrificed?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#9$1")]
[name="Cora"]I can't. It's not my place, nor is it anyone's.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#2$1")]
[name="Viviana"]You want to destroy the old order. But where is the new order? Can you guarantee it will be better than yesterday or today?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#7$1")]
[name="Cora"]I can't. Our future isn't for someone like me to decide.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#2$1")]
[name="Viviana"]Those who died for the plan, and the people right before us... don't you realize the pain they're in?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#7$1")]
[name="Cora"]I hear them. Their screams, their laments... I will never stop hearing them, not until the day I die.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#2$1")]
[name="Viviana"]Then why do you have to be the one to change everything?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#9$1")]
[name="Cora"]Because... I can.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#2$1")]
[name="Viviana"]That's the only reason?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#7$1")]
[name="Cora"]Someone has to. My life never had much meaning to begin with, except for one speck of light that never fully belonged to me. And I would do anything to keep it from going out.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#2$1")]
[name="Viviana"]I can't condone your cruelty, arrogance, or irresponsibility.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#6$1")]
[name="Viviana"]And as such, I must stop you.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#2$1")]
[name="Cora"]Of course.
[name="Cora"]Disaster has already struck, and by my hand. I've caused so much death, with even more to come.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#6$1")]
[name="Viviana"]Just stop this.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1113_1#7$1")]
[name="Cora"]I can't. Not after what it took to get this far.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#7$1")]
[name="Viviana"]Do you know what it is about your actions I agree with the least?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#3$1")]
[name="Viviana"]You really are...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4098_vvana_1#5$1")]

She embraces me.
I can feel her hand on my back, trembling.
I want to hug her and comfort her like I used to. Perhaps I did. I talked so much, even though I had already begun to go numb from blood loss.
I can imagine her lake-like eyes beginning to rain, her gentle complexion warped by torment.
She only just learned that I've never clearly seen the faces of her father and mother.
Through Werner's words, I could only imagine how they looked, how they met, and how they fell in love.
After all, I went into that dark spire the day I came to Vedunien. And the day I left it, I could no longer see.
Everything I know that's nice and beautiful, including Brandt, was brought to me by Werner and Lucinda.
Except for one thing... except this.
The day that Werner brought the girl down from the spire to me, the day that I touched her soft, timid hand, the day that I wiped away her tears...
That was the day that I became certain of it.
I loved this child, and not because she was their daughter.
But because I saw in her something that none of us had.
