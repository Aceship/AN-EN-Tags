[Title]Buchner is a student of an Arts spire. She often appears at outdoor concerts for her own research, and therefore has experienced many noise disturbance incidents. According to her, there seems to be a pattern to them.

[Narration]In order to explain it to me clearly, she pulls a roughly-chewed pen from her mouth and begins diagramming inside a notebook.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]So you're saying that the noise contains a fixed rhythm?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Precisely! Look at the sound scores I've recorded from Bach, Wein, Doppelhörner, and here, Sorgfalt and Luton too... Do you see it? This passage–– the sounds are almost identical.
[Narration(style="next")]The anomalous noise has not surfaced for a number of days now, and I have no audio data of it. However, if her account is credible, the pattern in the sound may prove to be a breakthrough in the case.

[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Is it possible that other sections currently considered meaningless noise also have some kind of pattern? Maybe these sounds are a code of some sort?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]It's not outside the realm of possibility, but if this indeed is a secret code, then we must deduce the corresponding cipher table beginning with this melody... Wait a second! I seem to have the vague impression... that I've heard this voice somewhere before...
[Narration(style="next")]I'll continue questioning.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Are you able to recall where you heard it? What were you doing at the time? I can help you remember.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]...I remember it was at the Neuleopoldshof. I was on my way to the Ewigegnade concert hall, and there were celebratory decorations being put up on the sides of the road, and musicians playing the piano... Suddenly, I felt a pang of hunger, but didn't have a single coin in my pocket. Just then, the aroma of roasted hock started to waft over...

[Narration(style="submit")]At the time of the incident: The subject was <color=#d41f1f>extremely hungry</color>, and had <color=#d41f1f>no money to buy food</color>.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]As the melody shows, you were distressed by your insatiable hunger when you heard the noise... Do you remember now?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Oh, yes, that was, that was... *gurgle*––*gurgle*... Ugh, it was the sound coming from my stomach. The topic of my research is 'Relationships Between Musical Trends and Regional Cuisine.' In order to collect data, I spend all my money rushing between various concerts, and end up having to go hungry... Ugh, I'm starting to get hungry again...
[Narration(style="finish")]I treated Buchner to a meal of roasted hock and three large portions of sauerkraut. I was unable to garner any useful information from her, and closed this line of investigation.
