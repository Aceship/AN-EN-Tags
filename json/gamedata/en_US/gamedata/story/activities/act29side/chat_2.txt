[Title]Völler is a sausage vendor in Weinshof. His wife claims he witnessed the agitators causing noise around the concert, but he himself was reluctant to be interviewed.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]He had red cheeks that may indicate a drinking problem, though his wife claims he stopped drinking a long time ago. I don't expect him to have a good temper.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Herr Völler, could you tell me again what you witnessed?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Like I said, I was flipping sausages when the noise started, and saw a suspicious figure sneaking into the alley.
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]I'm certain it's one of those lunatics who worship the twisted horns. They're always causing trouble, and it's hurting my sausage sales.
[Narration(style="next")]His gaze is drifting, and he keeps tapping his palm with a finger. <color=#d41f1f>He is lying.</color>
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]What kind of noise was it? Could you describe it?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]What else could it be? Screeching, cacophony... my ears have been defiled! It's an insult to music! It ruined the performance!
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")]An ambiguous description. His customers reported that he was alone at his stall that day and closed early. He was witnessed dancing to music by the stall, <color=#d41f1f>a few empty beer cans lying on the ground nearby</color>.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]I believe your wife was away from Zwillingstürme on that day. How is your relationship with your wife?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]My wife? Why do you ask...? Great. I love her. She cares for me a lot. She can be a little strict at times, yes... but that's a good thing for the family, isn't it? Hey, what does that have to do with you, anyway? Shouldn't you be looking for the culprits?
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]At the time of the incident, the subject had <color=#d41f1f>stopped drinking</color> under the watchful eye of his wife. However, on the night of the incident, he was observed to be <color=#d41f1f>heavily drunk</color> at his stall.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you were enjoying a drink, or maybe a dozen drinks, that night while your wife was away. Do you recall it now?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Alright, alright, a friend gave me a case of Ernstheim beer...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]You know, I just... I just couldn't take it down. When that ominous sound began, I... I knocked the case over and didn't hear anything.
[Narration(style="finish")]Herr Völler's wife angrily dragged him away by his ear. No useful information was garnered from him, and this line of investigation was closed.
