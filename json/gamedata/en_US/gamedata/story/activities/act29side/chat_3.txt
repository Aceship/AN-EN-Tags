[Title]Frau Lena claimed to be an ordinary citizen who happened to be near a disrupted concert in Neuleopoldshof. She was taken in for questioning by the Gendarmerie, but seemed strangely reluctant to describe what she saw.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]The woman sitting opposite me looked down at her hands, clenched tightly on her lap.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Could you describe what you saw at the time of the incident?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]Like I told you, I was listening intently to the performance when the strange melody began.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I don't know where it came from, or who was playing it... is this how you do your investigating? By interrogating honest citizens?
[Narration(style="next")]She wore an angry look on her face, but was <color=#d41f1f>avoiding my gaze</color>. There have been multiple reports of thefts at concerts as of late.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]No need to be nervous. How about we talk about something else? Let's see... the concert was a performance of the fantasy 'Erdenherrenwinter.' How did you become interested in it?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]What kind of question is that? I love music, especially fantasies. Erdenherrenwinter is one of my favorites, and I've heard it many times. What reason do I need?
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")]That was the premiere performance of Erdenherrenwinter. <color=#d41f1f>She could not have heard it before</color>.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")] You may recall that the concert was only open by invitation due to the timing. Do you have the invitation with you?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]Er, invitation... yes, I do...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Wait, I thought it was here... where did it go... Sorry, maybe...
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]At the time of the incident, the subject was likely at the concert to <color=#d41f1f>look for things to steal</color>. <color=#d41f1f>She was afraid that her false identity would be exposed.</color>
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]Outdoor concerts never require invitations. As the melody revealed, you snuck into the concert with ulterior motives. Do you recall it now?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]You're right... I took stuff without permission at the concert... but I wasn't trying to keep anything for myself!
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]I'm trying to return them... I just wanted to find my daughter, who was taken away from me twenty years ago... I wouldn't recognize her, but she... she'll have the amulet on her. I must find...
[Narration(style="finish")]I told the Gendarmerie of Frau Lena's true identity, but also vouched for her future. No useful information was garnered from her, and this line of investigation was closed.
