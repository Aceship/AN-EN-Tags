[Title]Kristin is a Gendarmerie squad commander stationed in Fortschrittshof. She is regarded as highly competent, and slated for a promotion very soon. Soon after I began my investigation in Fortschritt, she found me and demanded that I stop my investigation. She was responsible for security on that day, and I did not reveal my true identity in order to find out what her true goal was.

[Narration]Her attitude was professional, irreproachable, but lacked material evidence for her warning.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Thank you for the kind advice, but I've spent time and effort on this... I deserve to know what I'm facing, at least, don't you think?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I'm not allowed to talk about it... all I can tell you is that this isn't something you should poke your nose into. It's for your own good.
[Narration(style="next")]While these incidents had garnered public attention, <color=#d41f1f>few rank-and-file enforcers of the law knew their true significance. </color>Was she trying to appeal to my empathy with sincerity? Perhaps I could ride along.

[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Well... I've had some progress in my investigation, and it's true that there seems to be something dangerous involved. For example, I'm sure you noticed the unusual smell at the scene...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]S-Smell? Well... you've gotten pretty far. You're better than I thought, which is why you ought to understand my warning.
[Narration(style="next")]She reacted quickly, but I made up the smell thing on the spot. <color=#d41f1f>She was not at the scene when the incident occurred.</color>

[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]One more little thing. All indications are pointing towards someone inside the Gendarmerie. After all, security was heightened that day!
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]That's just an unsubstantiated hypothesis! This has nothing to do with the Gendarmerie! The noise was because... because... what do you know? Spit it out, or I'll force it out of you!

[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]At the time of the incident, the subject was away from her post without permission. <color=#d41f1f>The sudden noise made her panic. </color>Was she worried about her <color=#d41f1f>career</color>? Or could it be...
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.

[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you were away from your post without permission that day. Perhaps we can talk about your actions that day, without this becoming public knowledge.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Fine, I'll tell you what I was doing. But I won't be blackmailed. You can tell whoever you want... some Infected youths had snuck out of their community and came to the venue without permission. I could not allow them to fall into the hands of other Gendarmerie, so I took them to the Gendarmerie's rest area, where they would have a good view of the concert. Then...
[Narration(style="finish")]I decided to keep quiet about Kristin's actions that night. No useful information was garnered from her, and this line of investigation was closed.
