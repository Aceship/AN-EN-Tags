[Title]Herr Musial, who runs a century-old jewelry store in Doppelhörnershof, said that the recent incident at the concert was similar to another case he had encountered, and insisted that the two were linked.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]A bright light shines through the windowsill that has been in disrepair for quite some time. Through the window, one can see that hardly any customers frequent the store, and there is a 'Store for sale' sign posted on the door.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Are you Herr Musial? We've been in touch before. Can you provide me with any additional details regarding the incident you mentioned previously?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Oh, it's you. I've been waiting a long time for you... The incident happened a long, long time ago, but I still remember it like it was yesterday. Back then, this jewelry store was renowned throughout Doppelhörnershof, and its prized treasure was the famous Azure Lodestar gemstone. If you gazed upon its deep yet pure blue, even for a moment...
[Narration(style="next")]The Azure Lodestar was once reserved by a prominent nobleman, but it was stolen on the last day of its public exhibit. This story is well-known, and I require his information as quickly as possible.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Sir, I'm already aware of this. It's been a long time since the Azure Lodestar was stolen. But how is it specifically related to this incident?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Let me finish. On the night it was stolen, I had invited the City Orchestra to play there. Just as the performance reached its climax, a terrible cacophony suddenly broke out, and chaos ensued. In its wake, the Azure Lodestar disappeared from right in front of everyone's eyes! The noise was exactly the same as what recently resurfaced. The thief must be the very same person you're investigating!
[Narration(style="next")]His account was similar to the description from back then, though there was no mention at all of the noise. At the time, there was a black market order from Sargon for the gem, and the delivery date was slated for the same day the gemstone was lost, but <color=#d41f1f>the transaction was never completed</color>.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Though, I do have a little tidbit here, not sure if you know it already or not. The missing Azure Lodestar actually ended up in Sargon...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]In Sargon? Impossible! I personally placed the gemstone into the box and delivered it myself, but when I inspected the goods, there was only an ordinary stone inside! At the same time, the blinding Arts deployed at the venue were also broken through...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Could it be that the Sargonians deliberately swapped out the box to entrap me?
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]The real situation at the time: The subject of the investigation faked the theft in order to <color=#d41f1f>steal and sell the gemstone</color>, but didn't expect that the <color=#d41f1f>package had been swapped</color>.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Just as the melody shows, and as you've admitted yourself, you broke your agreement with the buyer and prepared to secretly pawn off the gemstone at a high price under the guise of a theft, but unexpectedly, the real thief was behind you... Poetic justice, wouldn't you agree?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]If not for that, I would've struck it rich a long time ago, and never would've ended up in the situation I'm in now...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I'll give it to you straight. All you need to do is spread the story that 'the noise at the concert was someone trying to steal jewelry from Musial's shop,' and there'll instantly be a steady stream of customers at your doorstep. Then, I'll package the inferior gems and sell them off, and we split the profit... thirty-seventy.
[Narration(style="finish")]Musial changed the sign on his door to read, 'Store for sale, low price.' No useful information was garnered from him, and this line of investigation was closed.
