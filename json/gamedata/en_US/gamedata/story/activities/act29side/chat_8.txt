[Title]The caster of unknown identity had been present at outdoor concerts across the city. There was no evidence directly linking her to the incident, but it merited further investigation. Locating her was not an easy task.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]A faint candlelight illuminated a corner of the room. The candlelight flickered, and a mask emerged from the shadows.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]H-Hello. You know what I'm here for. As a frequent attender of concerts, did you notice anything unusual?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]The noise you seek has nothing to do with me. I have no interest in the cacophony of fools.
[Narration(style="next")]It was impossible to detect any emotion in the voice. More specific questions were necessary.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]You seem to be particularly fond of outdoor concerts, regardless of the program and theme. There must be something that you are interested in.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Only a mediocre detective would need to seek the truth through questions and answers... I suppose I could tell you. My teacher pointed the way. I followed the teachings, searching for a power beyond my imagination, which is connected to my very essence.
[Narration(style="next")]The caster held something tight in her hand while speaking. <color=#d41f1f>It seemed to be an amulet.</color> I needed to know more.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]What kind of power is it, that you would go so far to search for it?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]...A staircase that would help me climb the spire and achieve great things. I saw the revelation in the light of my teacher's Arts and started searching, but I have yet to find it. I am walking through fog, and my eyes are wet...

[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]The subject was searching for something unknown at the time of the incident. <color=#d41f1f>She believed it would lead her to greater heights, and shed tears because she had yet to find it.</color>
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you were not interested in the noise at all. You are looking for something that you lost. Do you remember?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]The warmth... it comes from here. Why? Why does this little object feel so warm? It is like I'm wrapped in a blanket, in somebody's arms, but what follows is parting... sinking sorrow, overflowing tears. What am I searching for...
[Narration(style="finish")]The caster grabbed her amulet tightly, her expression hidden behind the mask. No useful information was garnered from her, and this line of investigation was closed.
