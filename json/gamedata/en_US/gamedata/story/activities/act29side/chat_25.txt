[Title]Lessing hinted to me that there is an envoy of special status related to this case. Given that I cannot ascertain who exactly he is working for, there is significant risk in hastily making contact with him, but I had no other choice. Indeed, I was able to find him under the spire in Josefgartenshof. What truly surprised me though, was that I found a short boy there.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]I waited, and walked up to him when he stepped out of the garden belonging to a certain count. As though he was expecting this, he lightly bowed and proposed we work together before I could even say anything.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]W-Work together... I'm sorry. Let me confirm this. Did you just suggest that we 'work together'?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I'm used to how wary people in your line of work are of just about everything. But with all the ruckus in the city, it's hard to look the other way.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I can't let these trifling matters give my master any problems. In that sense, you and I share a common goal. I have information that you want, and you should have gotten some clues from that guy at Ludwigs-Universität. The two of us working together will be mutually beneficial, and help keep you from catching unwanted attention.
[Narration(style="next")]The boy named Micha was well-spoken and had a very calm tone. Given the urgency, I couldn't refuse his offer. I agreed to cooperate, and we went to a cafe to talk.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]...That's the situation. Tell me all the leads you have. Also, if you personally got your hands on any of them, I want to hear about the situation at the time, too. I might be able to find some other clues from that.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Resorting to your usual M.O. already? Fine... Then to start, tell me what you'd like to know the most.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]It was the remnants of the Witch King that attacked the concert. I don't know why. I got this information myself. I was investigating a remnant stronghold...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Hold on, you could only see the scene itself back then, right? Are you sure you didn't see anything else, like—
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")]He knocked over his cup by accident. A few drops of coffee landed on his hand.<color=#d41f1f>For a brief moment, a child-like panic could be seen in his eyes.</color>Then, he calmly took out a handkerchief and wiped his hand clean.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]I'm not good enough to be able to peek into the minds of others, I can assure you of that. Please go on. What did you see?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I thought it was an abandoned stronghold, but after I went inside to go through the items that were left behind, a few remnant members suddenly came in.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I hid behind a pile of junk. The closest member of the group was only a few centimeters away, so I was able to make out part of their conversation: They had just returned from the concert in Bodenshof and taken care of the 'noise'...
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]Inside the Remnants' stronghold: To <color=#d41f1f>gather information,</color> the subject concealed himself and risked <color=#d41f1f>being discovered by the remnants,</color> obtaining <color=#d41f1f>valuable information</color> as a result.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]As the melody reveals, the situation at the time must've been pretty intense. So... naturally, you must've missed a few details. Do you remember anything else?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I have to say, your melody isn't nearly as interesting as I thought it would be... but it did help me recall something. After mentioning the 'noise,' they also said that they confirmed the sound hadn't made it out of Zwillingstürme...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]If it's as you say, and there is information in the cacophony, then if someone was intentionally creating noise at these concerts, then it's very possible they were trying to disseminate some kind of information. The victims were all related to Sturmland, too...
[Narration(style="finish")]We postulated that the Witch King's remains wanted to keep a certain group of people from getting information about Sturmland out, and it's very likely they succeeded. There is no telling what the information is about specifically, but a terrifying guess has formed in my mind.
