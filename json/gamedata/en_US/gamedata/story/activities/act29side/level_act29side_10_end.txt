The sound of collapse approaches.
Viviana turns around. The line of doors collapsing in succession scores in her eyes, like dominoes toppling into one another, or the fireworks in her memories going off all night long.
The rumbles travel from afar, reaching the tallest spire in Sturmland.
Her father seldom comes here. As the Kurfürst, he has to receive an endless line of visitors on festival nights, and her maid mother will be busy serving them until the early hours of the morning.
She would huddle in the corner of a room, just like now, and shield the sounds outside with books.

The knot trembles in his hand.
Ebenholz can feel the hand gripping the other end.
A hand already numb from too much time spent swinging a sword.
His strength, spent. His Arts, nearly exhausted. His wounds no longer bleed, and his pain gradually blurs.
His duty and his will remain seated deep within his brain, pulsing tenaciously. Such concepts are difficult to describe after language itself has collapsed.
Why did we come here? Why have we been fighting? Why were we born, and why will we die?
The void greets him. There is no path either forward or out, only nothingness to meet.

The emotions and memories he shared with him were not bestowed upon them by any person, Arts, or even fate itself.

A smile.
A piece of music.
A touch... of hope.

Fate will always be snatching things away from us, but fortunately I still retain the ability to love and hate.
Zwillingstürme's glowing sunset, ardent marigolds in bloom, a child with eyes glistening like a lake, and her gentle parents...
I love the scenery and the people I cannot see. They illuminate me, dispelling the darkness obscuring the eyes of many others.
But I also hate it.
I hate how brief the flowering season is, and the formless wills constricting everything I love. My child, your brows have been knitted ever since you returned to Leithanien.
You asked me: 'Where is the new order? Can you guarantee it will be better than yesterday or today?'
There is no way I can answer you, so I just decide to do as I have.
Love means responsibility, and hate will likewise attract even more. You must take responsibility for the things you have changed, and have yet to change.
My child, my friend, if you love, if you hate, then you will bear far more than you can imagine.

I doubt.
Is doubt a form of cowardice? Or bravery?
If cowardice, then why did I mix the flesh and blood of those monsters into our sacramental bread and wine, willing to place my hopes in a different faith?
If bravery, then why did I retract my hand? Did the vivid and hideous living tissues frighten me at the very last moment?
For sixty years I could not see that elusive Paradise, while my life fell apart before my eyes. I do not want to pray, but it is all I can do.
Who wrote the laws, and who ensures their purity and integrity? I ask my faith, and it stays silent.
I dare not say that I've already rid myself of the delusions embedded in the depths of my mind. No, I still harbor doubts.
The monastery gets further and further away, and I find a handful of seeds in the folds of my robe. Oh, Clément, my son, I will find them a patch of moist soil, even if I were to die on the road.
I doubt our laws. Question my cowardice, suspect my bravery, and doubt pushes me on forward.

Honestly, I hate alcohol. But suddenly I found myself unable to live without it. It's been a long time since Yulia's death. Three years? Five?
Twice in my life I have run away.
The so-called holy city of Laterano is not as perfect as it seems. The sweetness and noise in the air mask the inequality beneath, the differences between Liberi and Sankta seemingly not worth discussing.
I was still young when I came to Leithanien. The dark clouds I saw were a stark contrast to the white walls of Laterano. Countless died tragically under the Witch King's regime.
I was the first soldier to set foot in the Witch King's Spire, but I never once believed that his defeat would usher in a new era for Leithanien.
Yulia was wrong. I've always been pessimistic. Disappointment makes me sober, disappointment compels me to look for a few good things to protect.
But in the end, I reached a compromise with my disappointment, and ended up like this.
If souls truly have a final destination, then I most probably won't be going to the same place as her.
But surely I've protected at least a few people, at the very end? I want to ask Herr Executor, Yulia, and myself...
Do I still count as a hero?

Do we not respect life only by facing death with our truest feelings?!
I remember what you told me, Mamma. I can still hear your voice from time to time. How much courage do I need, to be able to struggle free from my ego day after day? To be brave enough to make that first step?

Arturia opens her eyes.
She seems to have walked for a long time. Time is like a river, and people travel along with the flow. But why is she, step by step, trudging back the way she came?
She feels she has become a broken vessel. And the unwavering affection, intense hatred, tremendous courage, and unreconcilable despair and remorse she has experienced through thousands of people...
They drain from her, drop by drop... until she is left with only her empty self.
She finds herself outside Kargereich, in a plaza surrounded by a crowd. Emotionless faces walk past her, and she stands there in a daze mirroring the same expression as everyone else.

How beautiful the sunset is, like a blaze set aflame when the shackles are smashed open.
