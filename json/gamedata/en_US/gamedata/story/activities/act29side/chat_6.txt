[Title]Muller is the owner of an instrument shop, where noises of an unknown nature had been heard late at night, mixed with what sounded like a man howling. He strongly denied such claims when investigated for possible links to the noises.

[Narration]The instrument shop was spacious, the counter free of dust. He was wiping the trombone in his hands, while various instruments were displayed on the wall behind him.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]May I inquire as to where you were last Friday evening, Baron?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]I tell you, I had nothing to do with the concert. I was in my shop and didn't go anywhere that night. I closed the shop when it was time, and went back into my room to rest.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Do you want to take a look?
[Narration(style="next")]His statements were consistent with the results of the investigation. <color=#d41f1f>The reported noises coming from the shop occurred around midnight.</color>
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]I would like to know more details. What were you doing around midnight?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]What's the point of all this? I was... I was bathing. Sorry, I don't have a witness who can prove it. Happy?
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")] There was clear hesitation in his answer. I noticed a page torn out from a book under the counter. Written on it were vocal techniques and the titles of several lieder. <color=#d41f1f>He had never demonstrated an interest in singing before</color>.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]By the way, did you develop a recent interest in vocal music?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]H-How did you know? Er, ahem, I mean, yes, the art form of lieder has piqued my interest lately. Only as a listener, of course.
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]Yes, I listen to the classic passages, humming along with them... I guarantee it has nothing to do with what you're investigating.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]The subject may have created the sound by singing. <color=#d41f1f>He wanted to improve his vocal techniques and demonstrated a strong interest in doing so</color>.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]The melody reveals that the sound from your house was created by you yourself. What is the meaning of those sounds?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]H-How insulting!
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]I know I'm not the best singer, but when warm water runs across my skin, I can't help but open my mouth and sing... haven't you ever had that feeling? I've been doing my best to improve my technique...
[Narration(style="finish")]Baron Muller seemed devastated. No useful information was garnered from him, and this line of investigation was closed.
