The Liberi limps away and disappears into the shadow beneath the sun.
It's a long one, like the one the Spire cast all those years ago.
Many lives faded into those shadows, with not a soul to gaze upon them. It was how things were, and how they still are.
The cello music fades away.
Only the tremors beneath his feet remain. He knows they are the sounds of innocent souls struggling for life.
He could stay put.
He could leave Leithanien like he left Laterano.
All he'd need to do is turn around and leave, like he's done for decades now. So much easier than leading the charge, no?
