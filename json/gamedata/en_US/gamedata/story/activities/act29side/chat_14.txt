[Title]Harman is an ordinary citizen who is somewhat well-known in certain circles. He wanders the city and hears many things. He claimed to have key information about the noise at the concert. I decided to have a chat with him.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]He looked around in alarm when he learned that I wanted to know about what happened at the concert, and took me into an alley.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Aren't you being too careful? I just asking you to tell me what happened there.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Hush. It's too dangerous for common folk like us. Are you sure you want to know? Alright, to tell you the truth, I wasn't there, but I do have something big that's 100% related to your case. I heard it with my own ears...
[Narration(style="next")]He pulled my sleeve and put up three fingers. I took out three Ducats and put them in his hand.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]What did you see?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Three days ago, I saw a strange masked figure near the Bachshof venue where the incident occur, around sunset. He was talking with someone else by the side of the street, someone who looked like a normal civilian, and they looked suspicious. I had a feeling it was something important and got close to them, and what I overheard... was what you're looking for.
[Narration(style="next")]He closed his mouth again and put up three fingers again. I did not have time for this.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]I know you followed them. There are ten Ducats in this bag. Now tell me everything you saw.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Well... I followed them once their conversation ended. Suddenly, he turned into an alley, and I followed him to see that he was talking to someone else. Then he took out something that scared the living daylights out of me.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]This is worth more than ten Ducats, don't you think?

[Narration(style="submit")]At the time of the incident, the subject was <color=#d41f1f>pursuing what he believed to be an important lead, </color>only to be <color=#d41f1f>spooked</color> by what the mysterious figure was holding.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you saw something that made you realize the unusual nature of this case. Spit it out.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Alright, but only for you. He took out a letter sealed with gold wax, and the other guy just let everything out when he saw it. You see, that guy must have been a secret government agent. This is BIG in capital letters, and I would stay far away if I were you... say, that guy was about your height and size...
[Narration(style="finish")]I took certain measures to retrieve the Ducats from Harman 'Long-Ears'. No useful information was garnered from him, and this line of investigation was closed.
