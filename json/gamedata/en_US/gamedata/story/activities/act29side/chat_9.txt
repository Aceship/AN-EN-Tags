[Title]Holness is an Arts spire student who is also investigating the concert disruptions. He had visited numerous outdoor concerts across the city, and was a witness to the incident in Doppelh√∂rnershof.

[Narration]He glanced up at me, then continued to write in his notebook, paying no heed to my arrival.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Let's cut straight to the chase. We're seeking the same truth. Maybe we can exchange information. Did you notice anything at the time of the incident?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Chaos. I noticed chaos. One moment, everyone was entranced by the music; the next moment, the fantasy was broken, like a golden age coming to an end without warning. Beneath the covered-up wound, chaos has begun to spread within us like poisoned blood...
[Narration(style="next")]His answer was meaningless to my investigation. I had to get something specific from him.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]I think I understand what you said. I would like to ask you something else. You were there at the scene; did you notice anything suspicious?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Good question. I did notice signs, tiny signals that could only be picked up by one with exceptional perception. I call it... doubt. Yes, the ordinary person would not notice it, but I could see doubt in the eyes of everyone who gathered because of the music, doubt about where to go...
[Narration(style="next")]Was he really investigating the same thing I was? I was unsure. I questioned him further.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Ok, how about another question. What were you doing at the time of the incident?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I was seeking, searching, painting the portrait of the Leithanian society of our times. I was certain that the noise that broke through the melody was the key to the truth, and so I searched tirelessly, until I witnessed it for myself, something so massive that made me stop in my tracks.

[Narration(style="submit")]The subject was pursuing a 'portrait of society' at the time. <color=#d41f1f>He believed it had something to do with the noise that disrupted the performance, but seemed to have been intimidated by the truth.</color>
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]The melody reveals that you saw the truth you were looking for, and felt a terrible fear. What did you see?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]The source of the sound. It was... struggle. The beautiful melody could no longer hide the stagnation of reality, and the sound that pierced the illusion was the cry of the people.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]The people are crying that the age of glory will shine upon this land again, and call upon the twisted horns that will once again stand tall!
[Narration(style="finish")]He quickly shut up when I reminded him that the Gendarmerie were nearby. No useful information was garnered from him, and this line of investigation was closed.
