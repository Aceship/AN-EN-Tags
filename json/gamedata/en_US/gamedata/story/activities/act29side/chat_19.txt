[Title]Schimmel is a gendarme responsible for security in Weinshof. He claims to have apprehended the instigator of the noise at the concert, but did not want me to meet him.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]The interrogation report he handed me was full of set-ups and lies. Right now, I'm more worried about the safety of this so-called 'instigator' than the actual investigation itself.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]I've read your interrogation report... You don't want me to meet the suspect, so can you please tell me how he caught your notice?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]What else do you need to know? Pain in the ass... He was sneaking around at the scene, and an Infected to boot. From all my years of experience as a gendarme, I could tell from a glance. Hmph. Those damn Infected, I know them all too well. I reckon more than half the cases around the city are caused by their ilk.
[Narration(style="next")]He speaks with conviction, but his gaze is wandering elsewhere. <color=#d41f1f>He's trying to lie his way out</color>. I need to ask for more details to expose him.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]Can you provide me with a few more details? For example, how did you catch him in the act, and how did you apprehend him?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]I saw him sneakily take out one of those vile Arts units, and he started messing around with his little parlor tricks, which is where that awful noise came from. I caught him off-guard, so I rushed forward, and subdued him on the spot. His Arts didn't do a damn thing to me... Ahem, said a bit too much there. I've always been the type to keep things on the down-low.
[Narration(style="next")]He's pulling this out his rear. The investigation revealed that before the noise broke out at the concert, <color=#d41f1f>someone witnessed him having a verbal altercation with an Infected person next to him</color>.
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]You mentioned the Infected. I'm curious what you think about Weinshof's stance towards them. You know, how we see them at concerts all the time...
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Hah, they're a bunch of dirty connivers, especially at concerts... The grating noise of their breathing is an insult to music! I have no clue how the higher-ups can show them that much courtesy, but I ain't about that! I have a duty to use my authority to keep those lousy pests away from the rest of us. Let's see them try to disobey!
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]The actual situation: The interviewee had a dispute with the Infected individual. He maliciously regarded this person's refusal to follow his rude demands as a violation of his authority as a gendarme.
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]As the melody shows, you abused the authority of the Gendarmerie at the concert, arrested an innocent person on false pretenses when you failed to drive them out, and deliberately retaliated... Aren't you ashamed of your conduct?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]...Ashamed? Hahaha, why should I be? I come from a long line of casters serving the spire for generations, but I don't have a shred of talent for Arts and can't feel its essence, so all I could do was become a gendarme. Yet <i>they</i> can throw around Arts at will, just from having a few rocks sticking out of their body? Those disgusting opportunists! Ashamed of what?
[Narration(style="finish")]I rescued the framed Infected, and Gendarme Schimmel was disciplined. I was unable to garner any useful information from the subject, and closed this line of investigation.
