[Title]Micha and I uncovered the message within the noise, but the truth before us was far more terrifying than I previously imagined: the Witch King's remains had conspired to assassinate the Kurfürst of Sturmland. The Hochbergs' informant wanted to send this information back, only to be caught in a premeditated attack. Das Kaiserinnensfest is occurring soon. Leithanien must avoid this crisis at all costs. I decided to make my way to the Gesatzspalast and submit all the information I have gathered.
[Div(style="line")] 
[Narration]I presented all the information I had to the Gesatzswächter. He stood solemnly like a statue. I couldn't imagine the look on his face under that golden helmet.
[Dialog(delay=2, style="ask")]That is all the information we currently have. If there is anything else you need, I will do my best to work with you. My apologies, but given the urgency, Sturmland is already at risk, and the Kaiserin definitely won't just sit by and watch... I'm hoping you will climb the Twin Spires as soon as possible.
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]Thank you kindly for your investigation. We have already sent troops to Sturmland. It is our responsibility to stop the remnants' conspiracy at all costs. However, I cannot divulge any further information.
[Narration(style="next")]His tone did not change in any way, as though he had been expecting this for a long time. However, just as I was preparing to leave, <color=#d41f1f>a minor detail in his wording suddenly seized me.</color>

[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]You thanked me for <i>my</i> investigation, but not once did I mention this was an investigation I personally carried out on my own. How did you learn what I was doing? Or did you...
[Dialog(delay=2, style="answer")]Your hunch is correct. We were the ones who commissioned your investigation.
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]Das Kaiserinnensfest is approaching. An investigation by the Gesatzswächter in broad daylight would only cause panic among the citizenry. As such, we needed someone capable to help us investigate in the shadows to pr—to verify the whole story. You did a commendable job.
[Narration] 
[Narration(style="next")]The infiltrating spy, the quiet Lessing, the envoy who had cooperated 'out of kindness,' even the Gesatzswächter. All these scenes flash across my mind. Suddenly, I realized that perhaps they'd all known of the situation since long ago, <color=#d41f1f>but why did almost none of them try to stop it?</color>
[Narration] 
[Div(style="line")] 
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="ask")]I would like to know... Do the Kaiserinnen know of this?
[Dialog(delay=1.5, style="answer")]As a Gesatzswächter, may I take your words to mean that... you doubt Leithanien's will?
[Narration] 
[Div(style="start")]
[Narration(style="submit")]Myself at the time: I was filled with <color=#d41f1f>anger</color> at their indifference, and also <color=#d41f1f>sadness</color> as my efforts could have been for nothing. <color=#d41f1f>But what is it that I truly wanted...</color>
The music of the heart sounds, resonating with the heartstrings of the subject and bringing back memories.
[Div(style="success")]
[Narration]
[Dialog(delay=1, style="ask")]No, I would never doubt you. I merely... want a concrete response. By thwarting the remnants' conspiracy, there will be no more innocent lives lost, and we will still be able to... welcome Leithanien's 'rebirth' all the same, won't we?
[Dialog(delay=1, style="answer")]The Güldenesgesatz on high act in accordance with the Kaiserinnen's will, and we serve Leithanien. Therefore... yes, Das Kaiserinnensfest will be absolutely safe. At the time of the performance on the Twin Spires, the masses will all bask in Leithanien's glory.
[Narration(style="finish")]I left the palace. This concludes my investigation.
