[name="Witch King"]Franz, steady your breathing. You're going to crush your Originium dice into powder.
[name="Witch King"]Their former owner, Bielefeld, was a rare great caster of Erdenherre who lived a century ago.
[name="Witch King"]He once used the dice to control the wind and lightning in the central valleys of Gaul, masterfully sinking the indomitable flagship of Corsica I and ruining the enemy's formation in a single stroke.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1116_1#1$2")]
[name="Witch King"]Indeed. It was a delightful victory. The Gaulishmen couldn't even manage to cobble together a complete banner. The lamentations of the fleeing and the cheers of the victorious alternated, like a grand duet.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1116_1#4$2")]
[name="Witch King"]Unfortunately, we lost Bielefeld in the subsequent attack on Lingones. I saved those dice as a tribute to him, in his honor.

The Witch King ascends the stairs. The sound spreads far down the long corridor as the lamps along the walls light up one by one, illuminating the path beneath the feet of the spire's owner.
Between the lamps float interconnected intricacies of witchcraft. The tutor sent by the Empresses was intended to perform poorly, so many a night Ebenholz would sneak into subtler corridors to practice.
He unconsciously followed the Witch King. For a moment, he seemed to think that the man was still living in the spire, only waking up in the middle of the night to head to the door, for whatever unknown reason.

[name="Witch King"]The short-horned Elafia opened the door. I didn't go in. I stood in the doorway and asked him.
[name="Witch King"]Over the course of three months, I reviewed the six hundred and thirty-four scores collected throughout this ancient spire, all composed by famous musicians and grand casters.

[name="Witch King"]The short-horned Elafia was still half-asleep. But more detestable than the sand still sprinkled, unwiped in the corners of his eyes, was his long silence. The fear and emptiness he tried to hide.
[name="Witch King"]He claimed to be the most knowledgeable man in Urtica, and even all of Einwald, but he couldn't answer a single question.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$1")]

[name="Witch King"]His expression of fear could be frozen into a fine sculpture.
[name="Witch King"]The foolish ministers who tried to manipulate me with a melody would be manipulated themselves, and the obvious contradictions between the twins black and gold could be exploited...

A sudden headache washes over him, much like the nights he was haunted by the Voice of Mundane.
On those nights, he could only grip his flute desperately. He felt as though he was dying, so he would exert all his strength to curse the man before him... until his surroundings became clear.
But the Voice of Mundane is long gone, so why does the pain still flow?
Ebenholz cannot see his own bloodshot eyes, but the layer of red webbing in his field of vision becomes increasingly heavy.
Pain stirs all memories, tearing through all emotion, as if trying to draw everything out of his head to transform into something tangible.

He laughs at the image of himself, at his own embarrassment. He laughs at the past nineteen years, realizing he has never laughed this heartily.
Even if thunderous rage were to punish him for his lapse the very next second, and headaches were to him back into the abyss, or even if he were to shatter into pieces, he wants to keep laughing.
But nothing happens.

The endless staircase, the spire of Urtica, even the Witch King, it all vanishes. Nothing remains but an empty throne.
Ebenholz stands before the throne in silence, waiting for the unreal sensation to fade away completely.

Arturia sees what she had read in the old Lich's memories, the 'blackness.'
Infinite 'blackness,' or rather— 'chaos.'
Human understanding of this word often comes from the negative emotions associated with it—confusion, disorientation, sadness, anxiety, fear...
In reality, it normally refers to a state that is difficult to describe, or an object or concept that cannot be established.
But this is the only word that can describe the scene before Arturia.
Desolation. A land of annihilation.
What sits behind the material world, the vector of collapse.
No visible boundaries, no discernible direction. Sound, light, shape, color...
Things that do not belong in the same dimension mix, stack, and stretch. The cursed lifeforms and their environment are symbiotic, even mutual bodies.
Annihilation is the only ecology here.
'Chaos' surrounds the Witch King's palace, like sunlight and air surrounding a... bubble that could burst with a touch.
The Witch King's Spire stands in the center of the palace, with Originium crystals growing from its base like moss between the bricks.
But such moss covers the entire palace, connecting seemingly irregular spires and other buildings, comprising some vague formation.

Chaos invades the outermost cluster of spires, like a rising layer of mist. Once the mist dissipates, Der Wiener Uhrturm and Die Tür des Wissens no longer exist.
