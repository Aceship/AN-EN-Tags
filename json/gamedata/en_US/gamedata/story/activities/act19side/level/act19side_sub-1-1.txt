[name="Ferdinand"]Here, the data you asked for.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#1$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]Thanks, Ferdinand. I didn't think you'd hand it over personally.
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#2$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]We were able to retrieve most of the Loken Watertank data thanks to you. The fewer that know about this, the better.
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#1$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]And I'm curious as to why you wanted these data.

[name="Dorothy"]......

[Character]
She gazes at the monitor in front of her, so focused that even her breathing slows down.
A video of a girl with white hair is playing.
The girl spends most of her time sleeping, eating, or sitting in a corner with a blank look on her face.
From time to time, she is led into a lab, where she crushes furniture placed in a room separated by a 1-meter thick wall.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#8$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]What a beautiful child.
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#1$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]You remind me of Loken Williams. I thought only madmen boast about their test subjects.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#2$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]Sure, he's been accused of crossing a moral line.
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#1$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]Morals are shackles that the short-sighted impose upon themselves.
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#2$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]Science has never been bound by common sense. There is no greater insult to a scientist than to be judged by moral standards.
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]Williams's problem was that he allowed the infinite unknown to get the better of his sanity, and he abandoned the logic and reason a scientist must grip.
[name="Ferdinand"]See at the end of the video how your 'beautiful child' turned the lab into a nightmarish catastrophe.

[Character]
The monitor is showing a different image.
There is no recorded sound, but the screams seem to pierce the screen and fill a lab from another time.
The fallen debris does not hide the bloodstains.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#4$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]......
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#5$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]What happened to the girl?
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]Records pertaining to her have been tampered with. Like the other legacies of Loken Watertank, she has value to somebody, somewhere.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#1$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]I want to find her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#5$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]May I assume you're considering ending Williams's experiments?
[name="Ferdinand"]She is too difficult to control. A risk Rhine Lab cannot afford.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#7$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]She didn't volunteer to be a test subject. I can't ask something so cruel of her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#5$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]You want to heal her?
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]We're not doctors, but anyone whose seen the experiments in their entirety should not harbor such delusions.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#1$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]No, Ferdinand.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#7$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]All I want to do is find her... and give her a hug.
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#5$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]A... a hug?
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#7$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]The girl... she's all alone.
[name="Dorothy"]They took her family from her, and made her something entirely different from all other people.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#2$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]I can't help but think... where is she now?
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#5$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]Has she made new friends? Or new enemies?
[name="Dorothy"]I want to hear her voice...
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#7$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]I can't change her past, but the future may not be lost yet.
[Character(name="avg_npc_522_1#5$1")]
[name="Ferdinand"]You know, Dorothy... I really have no idea what you're thinking at times.
[name="Ferdinand"]Not many scientists are as sentimental as you are. You're not bound by logic or reason either. Perhaps, one day, your madness will put Williams's to shame...
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#7$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]Madness? I've seen this in my dreams, many times.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#2$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]That's why I want to find the girl.
[Character(name="avg_4048_doroth_1#1$1")]
[name="Dorothy"]If she's still alive... if anyone can save her from her past...
[name="Dorothy"]Then maybe someone will be there to stop me, if I really do go over the edge.
