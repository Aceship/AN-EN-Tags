'Hello, Mary. When was the last time I wrote to you? I'm afraid I was never able to muster the courage to speak to you after the incident.
I could not sleep at all last night. Memories from childhood kept intruding into my mind.
Remember when you were fifteen, and we climbed up the judge statue in the center of town?
You joked that it was illegal, and that you would arrest me when you became a cop.
And I... what did I say?
'Everyone has the right to enjoy fairness and justice.'
I could not have imagined what would become of me in just a few years.
Civilization is a fragile thing. Not much separates us from the burdenbeasts outside the nomadic cities.
Fairness and justice have become alien concepts. All I think of, day in, day out, is how to survive.
Yes, I have become the kind of man you most despise. The kind that I used to most despise.
(Signs of erasure)
What if I have the chance to return to the embrace of civilization? To go back to the man I used to be?
Your birthday is just a week away. You have no idea how much I would love to surprise you.
(Long blank, then hastily scribbled words)
They're performing dangerous experiments on us. All I can do is try to keep living.'
