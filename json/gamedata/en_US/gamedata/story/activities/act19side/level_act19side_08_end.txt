A long, long time ago, there was a little girl who lived happily in a beautiful town.
One day, a storm brought with it countless black rocks and destroyed her home.
In search of a way to restore her homeland's beauty, she found the courage to set out on a journey.
The legends told of a most-amazing caster who lived in a faraway, marvelous land, and his Originium Arts could make all that is impossible possible.
During her journeys, she met a fowlbeast that couldn't fly and a tin man who was nothing but an empty shell.
The fowlbeast wanted to learn to fly, and the tin man wanted to find its body. They all had different dreams.
To find this marvelous land, they walked for a long, long time. So long, that the fowlbeast shed all its feathers and the tin man began to rust.
'I will give you my wings. With them, you can fan away the dust,' the fowlbeast said.
'I will give you my tin plates. With it, you can make it through the storm,' the tin man said.
The girl wore the fowlbeast's wings and the tin man's plates and flew past the desert and the storm.
She found the caster, only to discover an incoherent madman.
The girl cried in sadness, but her friends were there with her and started to talk to her.
'Thank you. I flew across an insurmountable desert,' the wings said.
'Thank you. I felt the warmth of a body once again,' the tin plates said.
'This has been such a wonderful journey,' they said together.
'In that case, my dream has come true too.' The girl hugged her friends. 'With you here by my side, I now have a new home.'
With the dreams of her friends, the girl set out on a journey again. This time, she did not set out to find a legendary caster.
She had an all-new goal. She would walk far, far away to where no one had ever gone before.
......
Dorothy, did you like the story Mommy told you?

She hesitated for a while, but it also seemed like the blink of an eye.
She saw green trees and red roses, a bright and beautiful day, as well as a quiet, endless dark night.
She saw a rainbow that stretched across the sky and reflected as smiles on the spectators' faces.
They walked close together, discussing food, weather, and the good harvest.
They saw her too and waved at her.
'Hello, Dorothy.'
'This is a nice place, isn't it, Dorothy?'
'There's an endless supply of clean water and food here... and all the wild beasts have gone away.'
'It's so great to relax here.'
'All the data from those experiments are driving me crazy, though. I'm always afraid that the director might show up out of nowhere.'
'We shouldn't stay here too long, though. A storm might be coming.'
'Don't worry. We know how to deal with those. Otherwise, why would we even have come here?'
'What is there to worry about, then?'
'Haha... That we can't be on our way tomorrow, of course.'
'And we don't know whether we'll ever find another place like this again.'
'It doesn't matter if we run away... tomorrow's still coming.'
'If all I do is hide here, when will I become the greatest scientist there ever was?'
'And that's why we'll be on our way as soon as it's light out.'
'Strange. What a long night this is...'

There are countless weapons pointed at him.
The name is frozen on the tip of his tongue.
Suddenly, Ferdinand is relieved that he did not reveal the name to the crowd.

After all, only losers have to resort to backup plans.
Ferdinand's laboratory has never needed so many plans. After all, he has always had a masterful control of the tides.
Many say that he is a capable businessman, but they don't understand.
He simply stays on the right path and marches on endlessly.

As long as you walk faster than anyone, money and attention will come pouring in.
And with these resources, he can walk faster and farther.
But...
Today, he has no choice but to walk this dark, narrow path. An escape route that he never seriously considered he would have to take.
There is someone waiting for him at the end of this path.
Why would anyone be waiting for him?
His coworkers, his family, Elena... None of them knew about his plan.
Aside from him, there should be no one who knows this place.
