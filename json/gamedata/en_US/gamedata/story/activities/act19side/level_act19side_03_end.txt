[name="Ferdinand"]Ben?

[name="Parvis"]You forgot again? You told him to have tea with me. He talked so much that he nearly drank my entire stash.

[name="Ferdinand"]I don't remember you owing me anything.

[name="Parvis"]Oh? That wasn't what you said when I'd just completed my chimeric organism experiments.

[name="Ferdinand"]The Diαbolic Experiments.

[name="Parvis"]Glad you remember.
[name="Parvis"]My student used an anesthetic of her own design during the final phase.
[name="Parvis"]To shocking results.
[name="Parvis"]Silence was such a smart girl. I miss her.
[name="Parvis"]After the project was suspended, I reviewed the data logs and found that it was no coincidence.
[character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_531_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Ferdinand"]What data?
[character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_531_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Parvis"]You're not the only one who digs through the trash.

[name="Ferdinand"]You mean Loken Watertank? Those data were...

[name="Parvis"]Let's not dwell on clerical matters, shall we?
[name="Parvis"]Loken Williams was a genius. Reviewing his data made me realize that I was taking the long way round.
[name="Parvis"]I was trying to increase the subject's cell activity, in order to increase sync rate with the energy contained within the embedded shards.
[name="Parvis"]Who would have thought that suppressing the subject's neural responses would be the way to go?
[character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_531_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Ferdinand"]Suppress?
[character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_531_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Parvis"]I made some small changes to your formula based on this conjecture.
[name="Parvis"]I hope you'll forgive the initiative.

[name="Ferdinand"]You're a sly one, old goat.
[character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_531_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Parvis"]Why the irritation? I simply offered a gift before you asked for it.
[name="Parvis"]Is it really so disappointing to lose a weapon against me?
[character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_531_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Ferdinand"]It had better be of use to my experiments.
[character(name="avg_npc_522_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_531_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Parvis"]I promise you'll like it.
[name="Parvis"]Oh, and if you're successful, could you pick up the tab on the ten boxes of black bean tea that Muelsyse owes me?
[name="Parvis"]I would have won that bet, if not for my formula.

[name="Drunkard"]Who was the main sponsor of the Diαbolic Experiments? Who was Loken Watertank's investor?
[name="Drunkard"]Who had the means to hire multiple labs to engage in similar experiments at the same time?
[name="Drunkard"]How irresistible did the order have to be, to make those labs put their petty patent feuds aside and sit down to share data?
