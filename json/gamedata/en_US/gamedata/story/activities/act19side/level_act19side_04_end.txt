You did not see how Saria moved. All you know is that she was standing in front of you before you knew it.
You know she never carries a Rhine-made shield on the streets of Columbia.

You hear Saria mutter under her breath.

Her expression tells you what her next move is.
Saria wastes no time dealing with pests.
Her hand closes upon the chest of the power armor, where a dark hole would soon appear.
The power armor would be destroyed, or more aptly, die.
A thought comes to your mind.

The power armor tips over.
As it further disintegrates, you see more hair, then a speck of skin, then an eye.
