Several miles out, the silver geometric body remains steadily suspended above the site.
The body seems as if it has started a storm. However, aside from the chaotic gales, there are also countless scraps blowing around it.
Some of the scraps were originally trees, while others were once parts of buildings and machines, but all of them have taken similar shapes, hovering around the body in the center.
The geometric body could appear at any moment on the outskirts of other Columbian cities. It could also suddenly descend upon Londinium or central Kawalerielki.
It has redefined what people imagine when they think of Originium Arts, it has redefined the known rules of physics, and it will soon redefine the already changing tides.
