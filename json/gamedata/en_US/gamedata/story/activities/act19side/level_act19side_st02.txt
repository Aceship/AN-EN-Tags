[name="Astesia"]I know... She's told me already.
[character(name="avg_274_Astesia_1#7")]
[name="Astesia"]I just want to stay here a little while. So I can see her when she comes back.
[character(name="avg_npc_529_1#1$1")]
[name="Rhine Researcher"]Haha... Sometimes, I'm jealous of Elena, having a sister that cares so much about her.

The sky after rain is always exceptionally clear.
This is one of the rare reasons that Kristen ever steps out of her laboratory.
It isn't that she particularly likes the twinkling lights. If conjectures cannot be proven, then they are only self-deceiving lies.
Yet lies aren't completely meaningless. Even if a shadow has been twisted thousands of times, it is still cast by something that is real and truthful.
Lies exist only to demonstrate one thing—that the truth also exists.
It is hidden among these radiant, twinkling stars, and the sky also isn't as far as it seems.
When she reaches her hand out, she will surely be able to touch it—
The only truth that has been suffocating the people from up above for thousands of years.
