[name="Interview Guest"]The vast lands of the frontier still have considerable potential for development, and we earnestly invite everyone whose talents have not yet been put to their best use to join us out there.
[name="Interview Guest"]But for those who remain steadfastly committed to their hometowns, we've also been preparing a plate redevelopment plan.
[name="Host"]And what is this plan, exactly?
[name="Interview Guest"]For certain plates that have not been meeting industrial benchmarks, we've thought up redevelopment plans to give them a brand new image. The high-tech industries attracted by the state government will make use of these valuable plates to expand their cutting-edge businesses.
[name="Host"]What exciting news! I'm sure all the residents of those plates can't wait to see the bright new future that awaits them.
[name="Interview Guest"]We already have concrete plans for a number of them, including Bayswood, Deadhorse, and Davistown.
[name="Host"]I wonder if anyone in the audience is tuning in from any of those plates? I'm sure it'll be the best news they've heard all year, haha!
