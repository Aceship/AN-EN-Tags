The man doesn't respond to Jessica's calls, and simply continues shuffling towards the snow in silence.
[PlaySound(key="$d_avg_wind", volume=1)]
In front of him, the vast white stretches far into the distance, blending into the dark, ashen sky.
From Jessica's perspective, the vast snowfield gradually squeezes the man into a pale blue line. After a short while, he shrinks into a small dot, then finally disappears into the white.
Nothing remains to prove he was even there, save for the tracks he left behind.
