New Year's came and went, but the freezing wind and snow continue to nip at Davistown, leaving not a shred of warmth.
Amidst the crowd outside the plate waiting for their ride, Miles drowsily thinks to himself—how long has it been since he's waited for a bus like this in the cold.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4105_almond_1#2$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1038_1#8$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1038_1#2$1")]
[name="Miles"]Right, I just remembered. The last time I was waiting for a ride like this, it was to head to a nomadic city to attend my little sister's funeral.
[name="Miles"]It was a cold day just like this one. Helena, Woodrow, and Leone... They all stayed with me while I waited for the convoy to show up.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1038_1#8$1")]
[name="Miles"]I was holding a bouquet stuck inside a vase from Helena's diner, and wearing an old suit Leone lent me. Freezed my ass off for hours.
[name="Miles"]Weirdly, I can even clearly remember how long Woodrow's beard was that day. But everything after I got on the bus is just a blur, like looking through a layer of frosted glass.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1038_1#10$1")]
[name="Miles"]I think I went to a huge city, but it also seemed smaller than Davistown. I think I cried a lot, but it also feels like I didn't cry at all...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1038_1#6$1")]
[name="Miles"]After that, it's just me hopping on a bus back to town, and my friends helping me get off.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1038_1#8$1")]

Unlike what Leone is used to seeing, Sylvia does not apologize, bow her head, and run off.
[PlaySound(key="$d_gen_walk_n", volume=0.6)]
She stands there for a moment, tightly clutching something to her chest, then stiffly puts one foot forward and walks into the diner.
She keeps walking until she reaches the seat closest to the counter, sits down with her back to the door, and stares straight at the empty chair in front of her.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1039_1#4$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
The cold wind blowing in from the crack in the door Sylvia left behind whispers as it circles past the mouth of the empty beer bottle.
It sends a shiver down Leone's spine.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1035_1#8$1")]
[name="Leone"]They went to see Miles off and will be back in a bit. But nobody wants to see you, got it? If you do, then scram. Just... leave me alone.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1039_1#4$1",focus = "n")]
Sylvia's fingers are tightly clasped together on top of the table.
She gulps down a mouthful of water and forces herself to turn and look at Leone's face. It is then that he finally sees what she had been clutching.
A ring, silver in color, with a few diamonds inlaid across it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1039_1#4$1")]
[name="Sylvia"]Mr. Theremin, I can't—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1035_1#5$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1035_1#6$1")]
[name="Leone"]...Him?
[charslot]
Their eyes meet.
Sylvia nods slightly and clutches the ring once again, her eyes burning with an almost crazed determination.
The look in her eyes reminds Leone of someone. Carl's eyes.
The night before he departed, he disappeared for a few hours. And when he returned, his eyes looked exactly like those of the person now in front of him.

Helena lets out a sigh. She nimbly hops over the bar counter, picks up the knife on the table, and bends down to pry up the floorboards.

She walks towards Woodrow's pistol, approaches Sylvia, and draws her own gun from her waist before placing it in on the table front of her.
