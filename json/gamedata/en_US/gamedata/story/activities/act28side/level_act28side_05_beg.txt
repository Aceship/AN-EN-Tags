The flames in the furnace blaze brightly, and a few sparks sputter from within. They cool in the air and turn into smattering specks of gray, falling onto the man's shoes.
He sighs as he rubs the corners of his eyes, only to realize that the wetness that had been there has already dried up from the high temperature.
