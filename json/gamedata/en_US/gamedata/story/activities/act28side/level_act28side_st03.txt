[name="???"]Ma'am, you've been in this pub all night. The owner is about to close up.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4104_coldst_1#1$1")]
[name="Helena"]That's alright. I know the owner.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1040_1#10$1")]
[name="???"]Are you waiting for someone?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4104_coldst_1#4$1")]
[name="Helena"]Nah, I ain't never waited for no one my whole life.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1040_1#6$1")]
[name="???"]Is someone waiting for you, then?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4104_coldst_1#2$1")]
[name="Helena"]Yeah...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1040_1#10$1")]
[name="???"]Will they get to meet you?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4104_coldst_1#1$1")]
[name="Helena"]I got a lot of people waiting for me, you'll have to narrow it down.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1040_1#10$1")]
[name="???"]Let's not worry about the distant ones. The closest, waiting for you right now.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4104_coldst_1#1$1")]
[name="Helena"]Yeah, of course they will. Gave 'em my word.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1040_1#1$1")]
[name="???"]It's hard to find someone who takes promises so seriously these days. Here, let me treat you to a round.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4104_coldst_1#1$1")]
[name="Helena"]You tailed me this long just to buy me a drink?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1040_1#10$1")]
[name="???"]...Believe it or not, I made a promise too. I promised the girl you're supposed to meet that she'll get to see you.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1040_1#1$1")]
[name="???"]You can call me Tila.

In a swath of scorched earth, I see a spark light up and drift with the wind into the distance, before perishing into ashes.
Or perhaps it lit up the night sky and brought forth the daylight.

[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#1$2",focus="r")]
[name="Jessica"]I do.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1034_1#5$1",focus="l")]
[name="Woodrow"]It's a stupid-ass choice.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#15$2",focus="r")]
[name="Jessica"]Maybe in a few years, a few months, or even a few days... I'll come to think the same.
[name="Jessica"]But I can only decide with the heart I have now.
[name="Jessica"]If I think it's worth a shot, there's no reason for me not to act.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1034_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Woodrow"]You think you'll find what you're after out there?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#14$2",focus="r")]
[name="Jessica"]Before... I always put all my effort into chasing things I could never reach.
[name="Jessica"]When I was a kid, I tried to chase my siblings, who were all taller than me. When I was a teenager and my grandfather died while I was out of the country, I rushed to attend the funeral I could never have made it to in time.
[name="Jessica"]And then, after I grew up... I chased disasters and conflicts I could never possibly stop. Again and again.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#2$2",focus="r")]
[name="Jessica"]I'm always chasing, but I never make it in time.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#15$2",focus="r")]
[name="Jessica"]But this is different. This time I'm not chasing anything.
[name="Jessica"]Because I'll be there from the very beginning.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1034_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Woodrow"]......
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1034_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Woodrow"]Then let's get going. Hope you're ready for a fresh start.

[name="Grandfather"]Why the tears, Jessica?
[name="Jessica"]My castle fell down. I spent all afternoon on it, but now there's nothing left.
[name="Grandfather"]Jessica, you built your castle on the beach. Of course it'll fall down when the waves come crashing.
[name="Jessica"]I'm so dumb... Why didn't I build it somewhere safe...
[name="Grandfather"]What kind of nonsense is going through your silly little head? You're my granddaughter, how could you be dumb?
[name="Jessica"]But my siblings are all so much smarter... They know all these things I don't...
[name="Grandfather"]They're adults. Of course they have more experience than you. When you grow up, you'll be just like them.
[name="Jessica"]But won't they be even more amazing by then?
[name="Grandfather"]Huh... How come you have so many weird questions?
[name="Jessica"]Sorry...
[name="Grandfather"]Now now, don't be so upset... How about I rebuild your sand castle with you?
[name="Jessica"]Will you really...? But even if we do... it'll still come crashing down because of the waves tomorrow.
[name="Jessica"]In the end... There still won't be anything left...
[name="Grandfather"]Jessica, if you're so worried about the waves wrecking your castle, how about we pick a beach further from the water, and rebuild it there?
[name="Grandfather"]Even when you lose everything, there's always the future... and we need to believe in it.

A warm hat is placed on the girl's head. Its brim is so wide, it covers almost her whole face.
[name="Woodrow"]If you want to cry, cry. You've been through so much... Must be tough to bear.
[name="Jessica"]I'm not...
[name="Woodrow"]Ain't nothing to be ashamed of, Jessica. New lives always start in tears.

After a long silence, a sob can be heard from under the hat.
The old man doesn't look down. Instead, he turns his gaze to the far end of the snowfield.
The sky beyond the horizon is dyed red by the dawn clouds, and its bright light reflects off the crystal-clear snow.
The vermillion hue stings his eyes with a sharp pain, and his tears begin to well up.
