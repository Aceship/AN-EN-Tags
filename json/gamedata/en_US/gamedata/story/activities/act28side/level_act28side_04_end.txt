Sylvia's stress and anxiety make her habitually reach up to fumble around her collar. As soon as she feels the familiar ring resting atop her chest, she hastily gives it a squeeze.
The ring's unyielding texture digs into her palm, yet gradually calms her down as well.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#9$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#10$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jessica"]...Ever since I was little, helping others was like grabbing a little yellow toy fowlbeast in a crystal-clear bathtub. All I had to do was extend my hand, and I'd be able to prevent the tub from spilling over.
[name="Jessica"]But that's because the faucet built with the wealth and authority bestowed to me only dispensed the warmest, clearest water. That's why everything around me always looked so pristine.
[name="Jessica"]But as soon as I stepped out from that bathtub, from my family circle, I came face-to-face with... reality.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jessica"]...Reality is a murky quagmire. When you reach in, you have no idea what you'll pull out. Or what you'll touch.

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1034_1#7$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1034_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Woodrow"]He really takes after someone I once knew. When he sorts things out in his head and makes up his mind, he'll set off in a straight line and never look back. He'll clear a path forward, but no way back.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jessica"]Sounds like... an extremely determined person. Almost irrationally so.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1034_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Woodrow"]Hardly. He was the most rational person I know: the source of all our problems, as well as the solutions, can only be found on the road ahead of us.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#14$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jessica"]I... I'm a bit jealous of people like that. Being that perceptive at a young age must save you a lot of unnecessary detours.
