A loud explosion rings out high up above, and its massive shockwave shoves Jessica to the ground.

She tries her hardest to get up and move her legs, to run forward, but she finds herself unable to budge. Her body has never felt so heavy before.
She lifts her head up to look into the distance. A thick cloud of smoke is gushing out of a giant fissure in the tower's body.
The rubble mercilessly pummels the ground alongside a shower of sparks, turning the nearby buildings into wreckage beyond recognition.
[name="Jessica"]No...
A frigid wind blows toward her from afar, turning everything before her into nothing but a hazy blur, and leaving the corners of her eyes feeling awfully cold.
She reaches her fingers up toward the sky, as though she is trying to grasp something in the haze.
She blinks, and her vision starts to clear up. She sees a snowflake.
It's snowing.

The underground passage's structure, fragile to begin with, is unable to withstand the explosion on the surface. The fissures on the walls are rapidly spreading as far out as she can see.
Almost as if underlining the fact that she is walking a path of no return.
And so, in the end, she doesn't turn around. Instead, she keeps running.
She simply throws herself into the hidden tunnel, and towards the unknown up ahead.

Woodrow leans on the wall. He feels dazed and dizzy, and the burn wound on his shoulder aches.
He takes out the bullet from his pocket. He can barely make it out under the faint moonlight, so all he does is rub its engraving.
