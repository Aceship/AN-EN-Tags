[name="Host"]About these low-interest loans...
[name="Interview Guest"]Did I catch you on the back foot? How unusual. Normally, you'd be bombarding me with questions.
[name="Host"]To be honest, I think this is a rather tough question, and hope that you'll answer it truthfully.
[name="Host"]Some believe that providing a deferment on the interest is simply using tax money to subsidize the local economy. Which is not only a waste of money, but also dampens the enthusiasm of the residents and promotes laziness over self-reliance.
[name="Interview Guest"]Speaking from the state's perspective, we have identified specific plates where something similar can be observed, but we must also extend an appeal to our other citizens. Please show patience and wait for our projects in the transitional zones to fully come to fruition.
[name="Interview Guest"]I implore you to have faith that our local residents aren't lazy, but simply need time to rediscover how to use their legs to walk again.
[name="Interview Guest"]The day they're strong enough to cast aside their crutches, they will repay our Columbian brothers and sisters back in full, with their hearts full of gratitude for your generosity.

[name="Bank Manager"]Don't forget â€“ Blacksteel is only what it is today because of the trust that Columbia has poured into it.
