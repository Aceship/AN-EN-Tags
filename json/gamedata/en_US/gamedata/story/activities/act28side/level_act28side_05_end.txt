Jessica freezes on the spot as soon as she finishes speaking. Ever since she joined Blacksteel, she has never once relied on her father or her family to handle any setbacks she's faced.

Jessica's lips tremble as she fails to let even a single word out.
She knows Sylvia is not being wry, but just stating the facts.
The long string of numbers in her account can ensure a carefree lifetime for <i>her</i>, but isn't enough to guarantee even a month's stability for the people of this plate.
She thinks back to her father's earnest reminders—To always act within her means, and to weigh the pros and cons before doing so.
But she never learned to, and thus has no achievements to her name.

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4104_coldst_1#1$1",focus = "l")]
[name="Helena"]Yeah, my regulars are all getting sent off one after the other, and only us old folks are left. What's the point in keeping the diner open?

[name="Helena"]Don't blame yourself. You're the last person who should be doing that. You're an outsider, and the plate was on its last legs. Just get back to your friends.
[name="Helena"]You have your own life to live. No need to work yourself to the bone on our account.
[name="Helena"]And the check you gave me back then... Take it back.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1034_jesca2_1#9$1",focus = "r")]

Jessica shuts the restaurant door behind her and stands in a daze on the doorstep, the check balled up in her fist.
She suddenly lets loose a kick on a pile of snow by the road, sprinkling flakes of white down onto her head and wetting her hair. Some land on her forehead, cooling her burning heat.
She retrieves a tape recorder from her bag and begins rewinding it, playing back the recording she has heard so many times.
