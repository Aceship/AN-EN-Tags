[name="Chongyue"]I dreamed I heard the wind rushing by at midnight. I opened the window to find the desert had become a sea of sprouting trees, some of them even in full bloom.

[name="Chongyue"]To me, a hundred years is simply thirty thousand days and nights, the urgent reports, the scouts departing, the Messengers returning.

The wind is weak by the time it reaches the tower. The sand in the wind touches the cheeks, almost like a caress.
Three thousand miles of yellow sand, in the blink of an eye.
