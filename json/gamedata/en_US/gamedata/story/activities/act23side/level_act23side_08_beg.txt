Massive shadows begin rising from outside the walls, blocking out the sun.
The Four Guardians of Yumen, retractable external mobile barriers known as the Wind Aegis, designed by Tumu Tianshi and built by the military's Department of Smelting and Fabrication.
For centuries, Yumen has served as Yan's border bulwark, and the Wind Aegis have been her shield, protecting her from the sandstorms, winter winds and Originium storms of the great desert.
The Three Winds shall not pass as long as the Four Guardians stand.

From Jiangqi to Yumen, how many times has she seen danger, seen her life hang by a thread?

What is it that has kept her going?

An eye for an eye.
Is there wisdom in the saying, or is it simply a result?
How many people have fed the fins by the river fort? Should their families seek revenge on her father?
How many people would seek revenge on her, if she killed this one in front of her for the sake of her own revenge?

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_787_1#2$1")]
No, longer than that.
Her sword has seen blood every step of the way from Jiangqi to Yumen. How would she judge those dead by it?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_787_1#1$1")]
That is why she came to Yumen, for revenge, and to learn.
Exact what must be exacted, and discern what must be discerned.

The sword is pulled back abruptly.

It leaves her hand and falls into a nearby ditch, sending a pack of fowlbeasts scattering in all directions.
The violence of the move almost injures her, showing none of her usual grace in practice or battle.
Her expression, however, is one of satisfaction.
[name="Qiubai"]That will do.
[name="Qiubai"]The sword has been thrust. It couldn't have killed you.
[name="Chongyue"]...Correct.
[name="Qiubai"]I didn't let go of vengeance because I can't kill you, though.

Chongyue stops mid-sentence.
His opponent is injured. A few more words would give him time to adjust his breathing.
But he soon realizes that such kindness would be an insult to his opponent.
There is no such thing as a truly fair fight.
Cast away irrelevant thoughts, and give all for victory. That is what 'fair' is.
