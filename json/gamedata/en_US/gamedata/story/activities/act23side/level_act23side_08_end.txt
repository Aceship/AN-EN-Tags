I saw two children fight over a fruit in that blurry mist.
They were about the same age and size, but one was quicker and punched heavier, and he knocked his foe to the ground.
He gets the fruit.
To the victor goes the spoils.
I saw that hunt.
Humanity declared war on Them. Mortals brought down gods that they could not even fathom, at the price of millions of lives.
Victory or death.
