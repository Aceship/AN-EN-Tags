[name="Herman"]   You've been by my side for fifteen years, but you've learned nothing.
[name="Herman"]   All you've managed to pick up are some unsavory tactics. What a dullard you are.

[name="Cronin"]   Dullard? Ahaha... Ahahahaha!

[name="Cronin"]   It's too late now! Even if you take control of the broadcast tower, the people will only start panicking!
[name="Cronin"]   The volcano is about to erupt, but what can you possibly accomplish with that "data" of yours?
[name="Cronin"]   I control all the escape passages! None of you are going to get away!
[name="Cronin"]   You bloody hypocrites can't save anyone!
[name="Cronin"]   Everything will be burnt to nothingness, along with the city!

[name="Eyjafjalla"]   Doctor, can you hear me? I've finished analyzing the volcano!
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   If we act now, we can still buy more time!
[name="Provence"]   Doctor, we've already determined the underlying cause of the volcano's activity. There's a good possibility that we might be able to stop the eruption!
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   Everyone, please stay calm and listen closely. If you follow my instructions, we will be able to delay the eruption!

[Character(name="char_188_helage_1")]
[name="Hellagur"]   We can definitely help, if it's really something within our power.
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#2")]
[name="Schwarz"]   ...Mhm.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   No, please let us handle this.
[name="Ceylon"]   Cronin has been plotting this for a long time. His henchmen must be all over the city.
[name="Ceylon"]   This is the critical moment. Schwarz, Mister Hellagur, you have your own duties.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   We can leave those things to the others...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   But this is our mission.

[Character(name="avg_npc_024")]
[name="Herman"]   Ceylon...
[Character]
[name="Provence"]   Agreed.
[name="Provence"]   We're Catastrophe Messengers, volcanologists, and Originium researchers. None of us will just sit and watch while peoples' lives are threatened by something predictable.
[name="Provence"]   What's more, there are people who would use their knowledge to deceive others and line their own pockets. As a Catastrophe Messenger, I can't tolerate seeing people like that!
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1")]
[name="Hellagur"]   I've never seen you get this serious before, but I understand. In any case, Mayor, allow us to aid you with the evacuation.
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#2",name2="avg_npc_024",focus=2)]
[name="Herman"]   ...Very well. Schwarz, you should come too.

[name="Schwarz"]   I'm...

[name="Herman"]   Ceylon said she can handle this.
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#2")]
[name="Schwarz"]   ...Milady, please be careful.
[Character]
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   Have we finished deciding? We don't have much time!

[name="Herman"]   We should trust her. Besides, what she said was right. We each have our own duty to fulfill.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]   Gahahaha! They're just rushing towards death! Even if they manage to buy an hour or two, so what?!
[name="Cronin"]   Your daughter is going to get buried along with most of this city, and you won't even be able to find her body...

[Character(name="char_188_helage_1")]
[name="Hellagur"]   Sorry, I couldn't control myself.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_024",focus=2)]
[name="Herman"]   Don't worry. He's right about the threat this poses. We can't afford to endanger the citizens any longer.
[name="Herman"]   Please lend me your assistance.
