[name="Broadcast"]   Everyone, are you getting all fired up?!
[name="Broadcast"]   In order to welcome the hottest concert in the Obsidian Festival...
[name="Broadcast"]   Starting from 12 o'clock today, all the malls, recreational facilities, and even some of your favorite bars and restaurants will hold a variety of warm-up activities!
[name="Broadcast"]   You do not want to miss out!

[name="Ceylon"]   Schwarz...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I knew you'd come here. After Cronin turned you down, you'd try to use the broadcast tower to spread the news so that the entire city would hear it.
[name="Schwarz"]   This won't work, milady. It will only cause confusion and chaos.
[name="Schwarz"]   Perhaps you hate your father and this city, but Master Doykos has already given enough. This will lead to the demise of the Obsidian Festival and Siesta as a whole.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   I know that the news will cause an uproar and maybe even have far-reaching consequences, but the truth needs to be heard.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I know Master Doykos has made mistakes in the past. Though he has done a lot of wrong, Siesta would not exist were it not for his actions.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   This has nothing to do with that!
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Feel free to criticize me if you must, but please do not do something that is beyond redemption.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Do you... do you really think I'm just some child throwing a temper tantrum?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   No, milady. I'll try to persuade Master Doykos, I promise you. But just for now, let's head back together.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Schwarz... Don't talk to me like that.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I know you and Master Doykos currently do not see eye to eye, but for the time being, you should head home first.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   I told you not to talk to me like that! I know that you're trying to mend our relationship, but could you not be like that?!
[name="Ceylon"]   Why can't you treat me like you used to? Talk to me as a friend, Schwarz!
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I am simply a servant of the Doykos family.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Don't say that, Schwarz. I don't want to hear you talk like that! What happened to you? Why would you treat me like this?

[name="Cronin's Henchman"]   What are you doing? Seize her this instant!
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#4")]
[name="Schwarz"]   ...She is the master's daughter. Watch your words.
[Character(name="avg_npc_020")]
[name="Cronin's Henchman"]   But the mayor told you to give your full support to Mister Cronin! Are you going to let her destroy Siesta with her poisonous rumors?
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#2")]
[name="Schwarz"]   ...Use your brain for a moment. She came here alone, without even the slightest show of anxiety...
[name="Schwarz"]   Do you really think she's trying to enter the broadcast tower?
[Character(name="avg_npc_020")]
[name="Cronin's Henchman"]   What?!
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#2")]
[name="Schwarz"]   Forget it.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Milady, you're using yourself to distract me, right?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   ...You still know me well.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I wouldn't say that, milady. But since you didn't deny it, I can surmise as much.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Right now, Rhodes Island should already be at the City Hall.
[Character(name="avg_npc_020")]
[name="Cronin's Henchman"]   Wh-what?! That's not a part of the plan! What's going on at the City Hall?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#5",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I'd assume the thugs over there are getting a good beating just about now.
