[name="Ceylon"]     Th-they've all been knocked out? I... never knew you were so powerful.
[name="Ceylon"]     I've thought about it before, but...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     That's why I didn't want you to know.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     But that was amazing! You're really cool, Schwarz!
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     Ugh...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     How'd you jump that high?! You ran up the wall and did a somersault!
[name="Ceylon"]     Then you spun around in midair and dodged all their shots!
[name="Ceylon"]     Then you turned around, and bang bang! You took them all out just like that! My goodness!
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     Milady... You're making me blush.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     But Schwarz, there is one thing I have to correct. I wasn't giving you an order. That was just a request from a friend.
[name="Ceylon"]     If you ever need anything from me, just tell me.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     Understood.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     Hmm? What did I just say?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     ...Huh?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     There's no need to talk like that! We're friends, friends!
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     Um... sure then.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     Haha! Let's head to the City Hall now. I wonder how Rhodes Island is doing...

[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2",name2="avg_npc_020",focus=2)]
[name="Cronin's Bodyguard"]   But she's a Sarkazian! Plus, there are several others with her!
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]     It's only a handful of them!
[name="Cronin"]   D-damn it! What is Rhodes Island doing here?!
[Character(name="char_290_vigna")]
[name="Vigna"]     Huh... Feels like these guys are even weaker than Originium slugs...
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]   Call everyone over here right now!
[Character(name="avg_npc_020")]
[name="Cronin's Bodyguard"]   But, Mister Cronin...
[name="Cronin's Bodyguard"]   I don't think numbers are going to help!
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]   No such thing! Don't you dare take a step back!
[Character(name="char_290_vigna")]
[name="Vigna"]     *yawn*... Hey Doctor, did you find it yet? I still want to go see that concert. We're going to miss it if we take too long here.

[Character(name="char_290_vigna")]
[name="Vigna"]     Huh? You found it? See, beating some sense into them works after all. Meteorite was right. Sometimes, violence solves everything!

[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]    D-Damn it all!
[name="Cronin"]    Whatever. As long as I can get out of here, it's easy enough to forge a registration.
[Character(name="char_290_vigna")]
[name="Vigna"]     Ah, Doctor, he jumped out from the window!

[name="Vigna"]     Okay~
[name="Vigna"]     Hmm, the General is still out there, right? I feel like this Cronin is going to have a tragic end... It would've been better for him to stay inside.
[name="Vigna"]     C'mon, Doctor, I'll help you out!

[name="Hellagur"]     Last time, it was Miss Ceylon and the Doctor of Rhodes Island jumping out from that window.
[name="Hellagur"]     This time, it's you. Karma is poetic, isn't it, Mister Cronin?
[name="Hellagur"]     These things happen in life, sir.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_023_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Cronin"]     You... You! What'd you do to them? What'd you do to them?!
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_023_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]     They'd be an eyesore to the beautiful view here.
