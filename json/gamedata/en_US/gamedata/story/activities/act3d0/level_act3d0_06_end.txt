[name="Ceylon"]     You-You took them all down? I never knew... you're that good.
[name="Ceylon"]     I imagined it before, but...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     That's why I don't want you to know it.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     But that was awesome! So cool, Schwarz!

[name="Schwarz"]     Uh...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     How did you jump that high!? You just got up onto the wall and jumped off with a somersault!
[name="Ceylon"]     You span like a wheel and just dodged all their shots!
[name="Ceylon"]     Then you landed and shot them down like bang bang bang! Oh my god!
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     My lady... that's gonna make me feel embarrassed.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     But Schwarz, there's one thing I must correct. I was not giving you an order. That was a request from a friend.
[name="Ceylon"]     If you want me to do anything for you, just tell me.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     Understood.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     Hmm? What did we just say?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     ...What?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     Don't talk to me like that! We're friends, friends!
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]     Uh... sure.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]     Haha. Let's go to the City Hall now. I wonder how Rhodes Island is doing...

[name="Vigna"]     Yawn... Alas, Doctor, have you found it? I got a concert later. I'll regret it in my whole life if I can't catch it.

[name="Cronin"]    Damn-Damn it!
[name="Cronin"]    Forget it. It's not hard to get the license and stuff. Gotta make it outta here now!

[name="Hellagur"]     Last time, the doctor of Rhodes Island and Miss Ceylon from Siesta jumped out of that window.
[name="Hellagur"]     Karma is a bitch. Now Mr. Cronin, the Catastrophe Messenger of Siesta, jumped out of it, too.
[name="Hellagur"]     Things happen, sir.
