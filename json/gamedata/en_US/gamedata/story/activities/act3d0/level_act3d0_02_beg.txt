[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4")]
[name="Ceylon"]   This is an everyday occurrence during the Obsidian Festival. After all, the concerts are one of the most beloved things about the Festival.
[name="Ceylon"]   The major concert starts at night in Garrison Amusement Park, while at daytime, you can see small concerts in every district.
[Decision(options="I’m already getting pumped up!;This kind of music is a bit intense for me…",values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1;2")]

[name="Ceylon"]   Haha, but you know what, I studied in Victoria, so I prefer more elegant music and classical. 
[name="Ceylon"]   Even though classical artists are invited to the Obsidian Festival, this kind of music is more attractive to the tourists.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4")]
[name="Ceylon"]   It started trending the last few years or so. When I was younger, jazz was all the rage.
[name="Ceylon"]   I love spending the day on 2nd Avenue. With a few books with me, I can stay an entire day in one of the cafés.
[name="Ceylon"]   Listening to music, having  a cup of green tea, and enjoying the sea breeze...
[name="Ceylon"]   It was then that I thought, Siesta must be the best city in the world.
[Decision(options="You must really love this city.",values="1")]

[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6")]
[name="Ceylon"]   Of course! This is all possible due to the support I have, including from my family.
[name="Ceylon"]   Besides my father, someone close to me works at the City Hall here.
[name="Ceylon"]   You'll meet her soon. With her help, it will be much easier to determine how serious the problem is!
[Decision(options="It sounds like you really trust her.;Are you talking about your mother?",values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4")]
[name="Ceylon"]   My mother died when she gave birth to me. After that, my father buried himself in his work.
[name="Ceylon"]   Since I was little, she has been taking care of me as my bodyguard. Her name is Schwarz.
[name="Ceylon"]   Whenever my father was busy with work, she patiently kept my company. Though we're not related by blood, she treats me just like a sister would, so I consider her to be an important part of my family.
[name="Ceylon"]   I'll introduce you to her when we meet.
[name="Ceylon"]   Look, Doctor, we're almost there. Let's head straight in.

[name="Cronin"]   What important matters bring you to the City Hall, milady?
[name="Cronin"]   Everyone is busy organizing the festival right now, so I'm afraid there is little time to spare.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Cronin, I'll get to the point. The Siesta Volcano is likely to erupt soon. I can't say exactly when, but it could be as soon as the next few days.
[name="Ceylon"]   In other words, all the citizens and tourists will be in danger. We need to start evacuating them and help them find shelter.
[name="Ceylon"]   We must stop the Obsidian Festival right away.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Cronin"]   Oh milady, do you know what you're saying?
[PlayMusic(intro="$darkness01_intro", key="$darkness01_loop", volume=0.8, crossfade=1.5)]
[name="Cronin"]   Anyone else would have been driven out the moment they talked to me like that.
[name="Cronin"]   But because you're special, I'm willing to explain it just for you.
[name="Cronin"]   You don't have to worry about the volcano "issue" at all. Even though I don't know where you got your information, I can assure you that it's nonsense.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#3",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   ...Are you kidding me?
[name="Ceylon"]   There's plenty of evidence that suggests that the volcano is active again and will likely erupt soon.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#3",focus=1)]
[name="Cronin"]   Such as?
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#3",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Agitation of the Originium slugs living there, unusual changes in temperature, and a strange smell. The conclusion should be obvious.
[name="Ceylon"]   If you don't believe me, read the material I brought. It contains a detailed analysis and the conclusion.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#3",focus=1)]
[name="Cronin"]   Obvious? Did you go interview the Originium slugs? Or maybe the hot air, or that strange smell?
[name="Cronin"]   I don't quite understand. What do these baseless numbers have to do with this so-called imminent eruption?
[name="Cronin"]   All I know is, I designed the volcano observation system, the mayor built it, and it is still working well.
[name="Cronin"]   Right now, the Siesta Volcano's parameters aren't much different from previous years. If anything, they're even more stable?
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#3",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   What are you talking about? The truth is right before you...

[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3")]
[name="Cronin"]   And who exactly are you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Dr. {@nickname} is from a professional organization, with colleagues who are experts in volcanology.
[name="Ceylon"]   These parameters were examined by the analysts from their specialized department.

[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Cronin"]   I see, I see.
[name="Cronin"]   ...Haha, I get it now.
[name="Cronin"]   So it was you bunch who managed to fool the mayor's daughter, strange visitors.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   What are you talking about?
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Cronin"]   Milady, isn't it obvious? You were duped by this faceless stranger.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#3",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Cronin, what are you trying to say? You don't even believe my word?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#3",focus=1)]
[name="Cronin"]   What I'm saying is, you've been studying abroad so you might not know this, but many people are jealous of Siesta's development.
[name="Cronin"]   These kinds of people appear every year. They've tried every trick in the book to try to stop our development. Blackmail, explosions, assassinations. They've even targeted no-name people like me.
[name="Cronin"]   Of course, this is not the first time that someone has tried to spread rumors about this so-called "volcanic eruption." However, it is the first time one of these rumors has even been able to deceive someone like you.
[name="Cronin"]   I must say, these grifters must have done their homework on the mayor. They even knew that you just returned from studying abroad.
[name="Cronin"]   And look at their nerve, marching into the City Hall like they own the place.

[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3")]
[name="Ceylon"]   ...You're right that I didn't know about this, but I'm telling the truth!
[name="Ceylon"]   There's no way I'd just trust any stranger who shows up!
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3")]
[name="Cronin"]   As far as I can tell, there's no difference between this "Doctor" and the swindlers I've encountered in the past.
[name="Cronin"]   There's no depths to which they won't stoop in order to take away this city!

[Decision(options="You're jumping to conclusions…;If this is a joke, it’s not very funny.",values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3")]
[name="Cronin"]   Jumping to conclusions? Hah, that's what all you swindlers say.

[Predicate(references="2")]
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3")]
[name="Cronin"]   What a coincidence. I didn't find your little joke funny either.

[Predicate(references="1;2")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#3",focus=1)]
[name="Cronin"]   Milady, you're still young, so things like this are bound to happen sometimes.
[name="Cronin"]   But don't worry, these swindlers will be punished accordingly. This, I promise you.

[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3")]
[PlayMusic(intro="$fesmetal_intro", key="$fesmetal_loop", volume=0.8, crossfade=1.5)]
[name="Cronin"]   Security.
[name="Cronin"]   Take them away.
[Character(name="avg_npc_020")]
[name="Bodyguard"]   Yes, sir.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#3",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Cronin! You won't even listen to me now?
[name="Ceylon"]   You won't have your way as long as I'm here!
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#3",focus=1)]
[name="Cronin"]   What a pity then. I can't just stand by and watch you disturb Siesta's order.
[name="Cronin"]   Hurry and arrest these con-artists already.

[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#3")]
[name="Cronin"]   Also, suppress Miss Ceylon as well. Don't hurt her though; just let her calm down a little!
