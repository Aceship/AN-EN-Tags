[name="Ceylon"]   Is it really weakened? I can't tell from the appearance at all!
[Character(name="char_166_skfire_3")]
[name="Skyfire"]   Be careful of the lava! How many obsidians on earth has it taken in!?

[name="Ceylon"]   They are irritated...! I'll block their way. You guys focus on attack!

[name="Skyfire"]   Big tail!!
[Character(name="char_166_skfire_3#1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]  I found its weakness through the lava, at long last. But I can't guarantee the attack will work on such a big guy!!

[name="Skyfire"]   We did it! It's going backwards!

[name="Provence"]   Yes! The citizens are safe now!

[name="Skyfire"]   Alas! Can't believe it would be that hard to cope with a slug! My skirt is ruined...
[Character(name="char_166_skfire_3#2",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]   After all, it leads a whole group of slugs.
[name="Provence"]   If people didn't destroy their habitat in the first place, perhaps...

[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]   I understand, but a mature lady should also learn to seek help when she's about to fall.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Th-Thank you.
[Character(name="char_166_skfire_3#2")]
[name="Skyfire"]  All right. Victory is always pleasuring. Let's hurry up. Maybe we can enjoy a few more hours of vacation time.

[name="Skyfire"]   Big tail?

[name="Provence"]   Oh, coming.
[name="Provence"]   ... Skyfire.
[Character(name="char_166_skfire_3#2",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Skyfire"]    I know.
[name="Skyfire"]    But we should respect the city's own choice and leave the rest to them, right?
