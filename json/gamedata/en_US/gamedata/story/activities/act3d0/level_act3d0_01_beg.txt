[name="Skyfire"]   Provence.
[name="Skyfire"]   Provence, you're absolutely, positively sure I can't burn this place down to the ground?
[name="Skyfire"]   All these useless branches and weeds are really getting on my nerves.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]   This is the tenth time I've heard you complaining this hour, princess.
[name="Provence"]   Besides, I originally planned on just checking out some stuff alone while collecting some samples for Eyjafjalla along the way.
[name="Provence"]   You offered to join me in this investigation yourself, so nobody's forcing you to stay if you can't handle it.
[name="Provence"]   Right now, the others are having fun at the beach. You should join them instead of going through this mess here with me.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]  I can't leave you alone, not with your tendencies.
[name="Skyfire"]  Even though you're a Catastrophe Messenger, only my knowledge can keep you safe in this kind of fire hazard area.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]   All the more reason we can't set this entire mountain on fire.
[name="Provence"]   Even though I know this is your specialty... we're on vacation this time. It'd be best to keep a low profile.
[name="Provence"]   Otherwise, Amiya and the Doctor will end up having to clean up the mess again.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#2",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   Fine, for their sake, I'll try to put up with this a bit longer.
[name="Skyfire"]   Hey, do you see that black-colored outcropping over there?
[name="Skyfire"]   Looks like it might be obsidian. Let's go check it out.

[name="Provence"]   Careful now, don't just go running around. And especially, don't set stuff on fire.
[name="Provence"]   Phew... Keeping her in check is more tiring than the investigation itself.
[name="Provence"]   But something's off... Even if it's summer, this kind of heat... doesn't seem natural.

[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]   Hmm? Wait, you mean me?
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   Did you notice a weird smell earlier?
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]   Now that you mention it...
[name="Provence"]   Hmm. Very faint, but it's definitely there.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   The volcano is expelling more gas than I expected, and the test rune Eyjafjalla gave me is reacting.
[name="Skyfire"]   By the looks of things, this place is going to go up in flames even without my help.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]   Something doesn't seem right about this volcano...
[name="Provence"]   But the most we can do is turn to Eyjafjalla for confirmation.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   Over here, we can get some samples from this outcropping.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=1)]
[CameraShake(duration=1, xstrength=5, ystrength=3, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=true)]
[name="Provence"]   Ha!
[name="Provence"]   There, that should be enough!

[name="Skyfire"]    We can do some preliminary tests on this sample with our equipment before sending it back to Rhodes Island.
[name="Skyfire"]    Eyjafjalla should be able to turn the test results around right away.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#2",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]   Just based upon how this obsidian feels to the touch... I can't say for sure, but there's something different about it.
[name="Provence"]   Also taking the smell and the temperature around here into consideration...
[name="Provence"]   I can't say for certain, but...
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   What are you trying to say? Spit it out already!
