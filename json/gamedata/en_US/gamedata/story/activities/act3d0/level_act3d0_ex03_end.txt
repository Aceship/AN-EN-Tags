[name="Emperor"]   It's okay. Let them come closer.
[Character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Bodyguard"]   But Mister Emperor, you still have a performance later. If some kind of accident were to happen...
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Accident?
[name="Emperor"]   You mean an attempted shooting, assassination, kidnapping, suicide threat, or something along those lines?
[name="Emperor"]   Do you think those things can stop me? Me?
[name="Emperor"]   No, those things shall only become a part of my show, just like how rhythm breaks apart the meaning of words. Do you understand?

[name="Bodyguard"]   Well, no...

[Character]
[name="Strange-Looking Tourist"]   Columbia's Rap God? You're nothing but a thug, a mongrel that got a little lucky...
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Louder, pal, let me hear you! Hey, Savran, don't drive him away. Give him the mic. Don't worry. Just do as I say.
[Character]
[name="Strange-Looking Tourist"]   You ruined our lives, but you still sit atop so much wealth... You, you deserve only death!!
[Character(name="avg_npc_022")]
[name="Female Tourist"]   Noooo! He has a crossbow! Take cover!
[Character]
[name="Strange-Looking Tourist"]   Don't blame me. That's right, it's all your fault. Just how many singers were sacrificed for your so-called "rap empire"...
[name="Strange-Looking Tourist"]   Emperor? Eat dirt, you bottom-feeding penguin!
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Ahaha, let me think about that one. Who's the one playing dirty? Riling up the media, manipulating public opinion, personal attacks, and now even a shooting attempt? Hmph.
[name="Emperor"]   You think I'd forget who you are just because you decided to roll around in the sewers? Will pointing your weapon at these youngsters satisfy you, "Songster?"
[Character]
[name="Strange-Looking Tourist"]   You...!
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   If I wasn’t such a juicy target for you, how many rising stars would you have continued to “eliminate” just for not suiting your tastes?
[name="Emperor"]   How long did you think you’d get away with spitting on the entirety of Columbia while stuffing your bathtub full of money?
[Character]
[name="Strange-Looking Tourist"]   Shut up! Just die!

[name="Emperor"]   How strange. You were the one running your muzzle, but how come my muzzle is smoking first? Why don't ya take a guess?
[name="Emperor"]   Is it because ya got no game, or is my brilliance that is to blame?

[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   My past is more expansive than this sea of falsity; so where are these "enemies" that await my majesty?
[Character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Bodyguard"]   Mister Emperor! Many of his rabble are hidden among the audience. We can't deal with all of them...
[Character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   That's all right. Don't panic. Just maintain the order here, and leave the rest to the professionals.
[name="Emperor"]   Professionals, like Penguin Logistics.

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1")]
[name="Exusiai"]   Well, since the beginning, our business covers quite a wide range of things. We even bought a jazz bar at some point, right?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1")]
[name="Sora"]   There were also those Siracusan gangs that really liked being our punching bags. They've been behaving better recently though.

[name="Emperor"]   When it comes to brawls and firefights, we're the best you're going to find.
