[name="Amiya"]   Doctor, I have to blame you for what happened this time.
[name="Amiya"]   Everyone has been injured to some degree. As the leader, you're responsible for that!
[name="Amiya"]   Gummy has already finished treating them, but it's going to sting if they get in the water.
[name="Amiya"]   Jeez, you need to show some more reservation when leading your teams.

[name="Amiya"]   Good grief... And I have a word for Mister Hellagur as well!
[name="Amiya"]   I explicitly told him to keep an eye on you, so why did he turn a blind eye...
[name="Amiya"]   Until a contract is signed, Rhodes Island is not allowed to intervene in the internal affairs of an independent city-state.
[name="Amiya"]   If we get caught up in legal repercussions, Rhodes Island will be in a very tight spot.

[name="Amiya"]   ...Why were you fighting with crazed fans anyway! If you're an adult, you should act like one.
[name="Amiya"]   No matter how much you like a band, you need to be nice to the other audience members, and you certainly can't pick fights with them!

[name="Herman"]   Dr. {@nickname}, nice to see you.
[name="Herman"]   Ceylon told me many things about Rhodes Island, so I've been very keen on speaking with you.
[name="Herman"]   How about taking a walk with me?

[name="Herman"]   Had you not helped my daughter, her recklessness would have ended dismally.

[name="Herman"]   I trained Cronin myself. His instincts may be base, but he's also very capable. That's why I turned a blind eye on him all these years.
[name="Herman"]   However, as of the last few years, he's gone down a dangerous road, and I can no longer trust him.
[name="Herman"]   This time, I left Schwarz here on purpose just to see if he's still trustworthy.
[name="Herman"]   The results were disappointing.

[name="Herman"]   ...I enjoy walking along this part of the beach.
[name="Herman"]   That's because my wife, Barbara, sleeps deep beneath these waves.
[name="Herman"]   I still remember that day; the weather was a bit warm, and the sunset was splendid. She turned to me here and said, "If only we could stay here forever."
[name="Herman"]   In the blink of an eye, I was left behind.
[name="Herman"]   Doctor, turn around and take a look.
[name="Herman"]   Do you understand now? This city is a paradise I built for her.
[name="Herman"]   As for why I'm telling you this...
[name="Herman"]   Because I can tell that you and I are the same type of person.
[name="Herman"]   In this world, not everything can be resolved with good. Sometimes, we must get our hands dirty.
[Decision(options="I agree.;I disagree.;Who knows...",values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Herman"]   For me, good and bad lost their meaning a long time ago. The only things that matter to me are results, and this city.
[Decision(options="Why not tell Ceylon?",values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Herman"]   I'm not looking for understanding, Doctor.
[name="Herman"]   If I needed my daughter's understanding, we would not have become like we are now.
[name="Herman"]   Besides, do you think she'd really understand if I told her?
[name="Herman"]   No. She still needs a long time to understand that the world isn't as black and white as she thinks.
[name="Herman"]   Schwarz hopes that she will never understand, but I... Unfortunately, I lost the ability to make that choice.
[name="Herman"]   Doctor, Ceylon would like to join you, so I asked Schwarz to accompany her. I'm fine with it.
[name="Herman"]   After all, this Siesta is no longer her paradise.
[name="Herman"]   I've seen the new geological report. Sooner or later, Siesta will be consumed by the magma.
[name="Herman"]   We've managed to postpone that day's coming. I am grateful for the effort that you've all put forth today.
[name="Herman"]   Over the years, I've been looking for a solution to this matter. I have found it, but the price is almost as great.
[name="Herman"]   The new development zone I've been working on will become a brand new mobile city. By the looks of things, it will become the next Siesta.
[name="Herman"]   I'm deeply attached to this place, but that doesn't mean that I can ignore the volcano that slumbers fitfully beside me.
[name="Herman"]   After the end of this Obsidian Festival, we will begin moving into the new mobile city. As for Siesta, we will let her rest until the magma reclaims her.

[Decision(options="The Obsidian Festival...",values="1")]

[name="Herman"]   I heard that this ocean is bounded by land. Some have told me that this isn't a real ocean. It may be wide, but it's not boundless.
[name="Herman"]   In that case, we will continue to follow the coast. Perhaps one day, we will finally return to our starting point, the real starting point.
[name="Herman"]   However, by that time, this beautiful beach, the great Obsidian Festival, and this coastal city with its volcanic smell...
[name="Herman"]   The Siesta that holds the memory of countless people, will be gone forever.
[name="Herman"]   Perhaps one day, you'll be able to tell her what I've told you here today.
[name="Herman"]   Perhaps that day will never come.
[name="Herman"]   And one day, should she perhaps need my help, you can come find me.
[name="Herman"]   No matter where Siesta is or what it looks like, this city will forever support her.
[name="Herman"]   Or rather, I should say... As long as Siestans exist, Siesta also exists. Within the hearts of young people like her are where Siesta really is.

[name="Herman"]   Now, seize the day, and enjoy the Obsidian Festival.
[name="Herman"]   At least until we find another suitable location, we'll have to suspend our collaboration with Siren Records. I have a lot of things to discuss with them.
[name="Herman"]   Schwarz seems to have something to tell you. She's over there.
[name="Herman"]   If I keep talking for much longer, she won't have anything to say. You should hear it from her.

[name="Schwarz"]   But, I have to thank you as well. Without your help, we might never have been able to clear up our misunderstanding.
[name="Schwarz"]   Truthfully, I did not want her getting involved with these things, but perhaps you were right. She has her own ideas, and her own responsibilities.
