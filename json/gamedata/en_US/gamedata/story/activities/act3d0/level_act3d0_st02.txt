[name="Eyjafjalla"]   Finally, through comparing isotopes and analyzing various samples, we've basically been able to confirm your hypothesis.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   The frequency of volcanic activity has, without a doubt, been rising abnormally. Though there's no imminent danger of a Catastrophe, we cannot ignore the danger.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   In two to four weeks, the volcanic activity will reach a critical point. Expect a Catastrophe to occur at that point.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   If possible, I would recommend beginning evacuation efforts as soon as possible.                    
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   ...To summarize, that's the conclusion I've drawn from the information you provided me.

[name="Provence"]   That's Eyjafjalla for you. She can even give a 40-minute lecture over the phone.
[name="Provence"]   Doctor, did you understand all that?
[Decision(options="In one ear and out the other.;Mhm, I understood the gist of it.",values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Provence"]   That's what I thought as well. Before I could react, it was already over.
[Predicate(references="2")]
[name="Provence"]   Wow, that's amazing, Doctor. I couldn't understand her at all...
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[name="Provence"]   Seeing those two over there, I thought I was the only one who wasn't getting it.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_166_skfire_3#2",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   As expected of Eyjafjalla. Even I felt like I was just put through a seminar.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_166_skfire_3#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   I see, so that's a true professional. I never knew the data could be analyzed like that.
[name="Ceylon"]   I didn't expect to be presented with such a good learning experience. Jeez, I should have written it all down!
[Character]
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   Even though the information we have right now is far from comprehensive, I've reached the same conclusion as you have. The volcano has most likely become active once more.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   Unfortunately, I can't be there to further delve into why it has become active.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   ...Sorry. If we had a bit more on-site information, we'd be able to better predict the activity cycle.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]   That way, we'd be able to evacuate the citizens more easily.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1")]
[name="Provence"]   We all know that you're passionate about volcanoes, Eyjafjalla.
[name="Provence"]   You've already been a great help. Thank you very much.

[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4")]
[name="Ceylon"]   I'm glad I had such a professional team like yours to help me confirm my findings.
[name="Ceylon"]   Something might be wrong with the detector in the monitoring station. It hasn't detected any abnormal readings so far.
[name="Ceylon"]   By the looks of things, my efforts were worth it.
[name="Ceylon"]   We've got to send news of this to the City Council. Otherwise, the results could be devastating.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   You're telling me that Siesta didn't even make any emergency plans for a possible Catastrophe before hosting such a large-scale event?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2")]
[name="Ceylon"]   The people here probably haven't even considered the possibility of a Catastrophe, let alone made preparations for it.
[name="Ceylon"]   My father went to the new development zone to conduct business about three months ago, and won't be back for a few more days. Now, his secretary, Cronin, is responsible for everything.
[name="Ceylon"]   Cronin is also this city's Catastrophe Messenger. When we take the data and the samples down to the City Hall, he'll be able to understand the situation.
[name="Ceylon"]   Even though I'm the mayor's daughter, I rarely get involved in the government's affairs.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4")]
[name="Ceylon"]   But now that we have definitive proof, I might be able to get some help from the family.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1")]
[name="Provence"]   Doctor, I have an idea. I want to head to the volcano again to check on that reason that Eyjafjalla mentioned.
[name="Provence"]   Can you help Ceylon out while I'm gone?
[Decision(options="You're entering the volcano? Isn't that a bit too dangerous?!",values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1")]
[name="Provence"]   Catastrophe Messengers always put their lives on the line for their work, so don't worry. I have plenty of experience with this kind of stuff.
[name="Provence"]   Although I'll only be able to call you from the hotel, I'll be sure to stay connected with the Doctor.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   I'll also come with you.
[CharacterCutin(widgetID="1")]
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]   Huh?
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   Got a problem with that? I can't just let you go alone. What if you ruin all the precious data?
[name="Skyfire"]   Of course I have to go with you.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]   Um, all right, all right.
[name="Provence"]   By the way, do we need to notify Amiya first?
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#2",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   Nah, it's fine. It's not that serious. As long as the Doctor knows about it, we're good.

[name="Ceylon"]   Phew, that about wraps things up. I suppose I can finally relax a bit.
[name="Ceylon"]   Doctor, here's some tea I brought back from Victoria. Would you like a cup?
[Decision(options="Sure.;No thank you.",values="2;3")]
[Predicate(references="2")]
[name="Ceylon"]   I think you'll enjoy it.

[Predicate(references="3")]
[name="Ceylon"]   Do you not know how to make tea? I'll help you then.
[Decision(options="Sure.;...No thank you.",values="4;5")]
[Predicate(references="4")]
[name="Ceylon"]   Mhm, I just know you'll like it.
[Predicate(references="5")]
[name="Ceylon"]   You're a really difficult person, you know.
[name="Ceylon"]   I'll have you know that this is one of the highest-grade teas in Victoria!

[Decision(options="Fine, you win.;......No thank you.",values="6;7")]
[Predicate(references="6")]
[name="Ceylon"]   There you go. You'll definitely like it.
[Predicate(references="7")]
[name="Ceylon"]   I make really good tea. You'll regret it your whole life if you miss this chance.

[Decision(options=".........Fine.",values="8")]
[Predicate(references="8")]
[name="Ceylon"]   How stubborn. I had to say all that just to make you try it.
[name="Ceylon"]   All right, just wait a moment.
