[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Welcome to Trials for Navigator, Doctor. This is a simulation program developed for Rhodes Island personnel.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] According to my records, the program was originally designed to train AI buggies.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] ......
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] You have improvised changes to the project in accordance with Kal'tsit's request.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Ahem. Regardless, Trials for Navigator virtually recreates environments and enemies using existing combat records.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Since it's designed for command personnel, enemy data is mainly based on elite and leader-class enemies that have been previously encountered.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] In other words, your old friends are lining up to say hi!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] This may be just a simulation, but there's nothing virtual about your command.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Show off your skills on this unique battlefield!
