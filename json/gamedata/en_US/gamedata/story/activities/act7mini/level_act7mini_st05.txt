[name="Noble Attendant"]  Please wait here for a moment. We'll have someone bring you the contract.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  All the fine points of this collaboration are detailed in here. Please bring it back and have the Count read it over.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask... Miss Carnelian? Are you listening?

[name="Carnelian"]  Hmm?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1")]
[name="Carnelian"]  Oh... Sorry, I spaced out a little.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  ......
[name="Noble Attendant"]  So, as I was saying, do you have any questions about this collaboration?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Not for the moment. I will bring this back to Count Hohenlohe so that he may make his decision.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Wonderful. I look forward to the Count arriving at a decision that will benefit us both.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Are you leaving already? If you have no other plans, Sir Feuerbach told me to accompany...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  You needn't worry. Do let Sir Feuerbach know how thankful I am for his generosity.
[name="Carnelian"]  Since I am here, I will take a stroll around the city to see the sights.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Ah, would you like a guide, then? I can arrange for one right away.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Please don't worry yourself. I will just be strolling about.
[name="Carnelian"]  Oh, this reminds me... I visited before when I represented the Count on our last collaboration. I believe that was before the Empresses' last banquet?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Precisely.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  If I remember correctly, this place was filled with the horns of other species as decorations. Are we trying out new style?
[name="Carnelian"]  Hmm, take this ornament for example. You don't see its quality and lustrousness every day. If I have to guess, they must be made from Solidified Origincrystals.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  That is correct.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Miss Carnelian, I must say, you have a good eye, and far more so than before.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  You flatter me.
[name="Carnelian"]  As far as I know, stable crystals such as these can only be mined in the deepest parts of Originium veins, and most of them are buried inside the Originium itself. That makes them extraordinarily rare.
[name="Carnelian"]  And these crystals are far harder than stone. Normal carving processes cannot so much as make a dent on them.
[name="Carnelian"]  Considering the difficulty of the process, I suppose it must have taken Sir Feuerbach some effort to amass such a massive collection of fine decorations?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  It's not actually that difficult. Master Feuerbach found this collection of Originium art pieces by coincidence when he diligently inspected his territory.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  He thought that their black luster is full of appeal and mystique, making them prime for viewing, and so he had us place them here so that they may be appreciated by all our visitors.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  In that case, I guess we should raise a glass to his generosity.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Miss Carnelian, you seem to be familiar with the subject.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  I can't say I'm familiar with them... Though... Hm... I've seen how these are produced before, so it does stir my emotions a little.
[name="Carnelian"]  Take a look at this. For just a small chunk of Origincrystal like this, you must dig several hundreds, if not thousands of meters deep. If you lose your footing on your way down, you will most certainly die.
[name="Carnelian"]  I heard the mining sites in this territory have had quite a few accidents of late? It's such a small trinket, but the amount of blood spilled for its mining could perhaps fill the knight's bathtub.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  ......
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Miss Carnelian, I believe you are mistaken...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#2", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Oh?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#2", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  For most, these items are indeed difficult to obtain, but they are merely seasonal decorations for Sir Feuerbach.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Such considerations simply do not matter to him.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Whatever his wish is, all he has to do is give the order. That is why we stand here.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#2", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Heh...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#2", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Do you perhaps see it differently?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  I'm afraid you wouldn't want to know how I see it.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  With all due respect, Miss Carnelian... You are indebted to the Count's kindness.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Hm.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  The world was shocked when, two years ago, we found an outsider whom none of us have heard of serving the then-underage Count Hohenlohe as his attendant. This has never happened before.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  You should be more careful and consider the Count's position and reputation before you act.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#5", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  It sounds like you're not very fond with the way I do things.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  And before you deny it, I've actually met plenty of people who antagonize me as well as those who see the Count as an outsider among the nobles.
[name="Carnelian"]  So, am I more or less on point?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  It is no simple task to have the entire Leithanien be so accepting of an outsider.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  But you don't seem to mind those rumors at all. Certainly, you are no less talented than what the rumors suggest. You are bold as well. Anything I say can only hold you in high esteem.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#7", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Hah, you certainly have a way with words, but I will take that as a compliment.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#7", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  As for the accident that occurred at the mines... You needn't worry. Our guards and Casters are already on the case.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  You are right. We indeed need to be more careful given the situation. This accident will be dealt with accordingly. No one will be able to use it against the Count.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Oh, you think that's what I'm worried about?
[name="Carnelian"]  Okay, let's say that's how it is, then. Though, as far as I know, the way you deal with things accordingly isn't generally very peaceful.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  We're merely ridding our blankets of dust.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Oh, so you're saying taking out everyone involved is a way of solving problems?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  It looks like I'm overstaying my welcome. Please excuse me.
[name="Carnelian"]  Before I go, let me remind you that while Sir Feuerbach is free to ignore the sick in his territory, the Empresses are no gentle little lambs. Looking down on them will not serve you well.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Oh, no no. You must be mistaken, Miss Carnelian, we have never looked down upon the Empresses.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  The Empresses need authority. They need a stronger, authoritative rule. They want to be obeyed, not followed. They have already turned their attention toward us and made the time to deal with us.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Understandable. All rulers eventually walk down this path.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  It's hardly a surprise. We are very familiar with how each other think.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Looks like you are pretty confident.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  You are fearful because you haven't experienced Leithanien's past, Miss Carnelian.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  The Empresses, whether the golden or the black, simply do not compare to the shadows that once shrouded Leithanien.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  And that is despite the fact it was them who overthrew those shadows.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  You are saying...?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  I lived through that era myself. The red crystals hung high above the towers became a symbol of terror that parents would use it to force their children to behave.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  The Witch King...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  We don't speak that name these days.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Indeed, I seldom hear of anything on the subject, only some rumors here and there. I heard the legend that a red glow illuminating the entire night sky and how it could be seen all across Leithanien.
[name="Carnelian"]  The older generation seems to never have forgotten this, yet they are always mum on the subject.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  This is normal... Aside from trust, fear is also an effective way to silence men.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  I witnessed that sea of red too... And on the second day, the townsmen found that the people of the next town over were all dead. There, dead fowlbeasts were scattered all across the ground, with their feet torn.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  No one knows why. All they know is there were a red glow and the countless corpses it left behind.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  This sounds like a horror story.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Alas, it is also nothing more than a story.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  There exists no reason, no regularity, and no explanation. No one dared to discuss it. Leithanien used to be like that.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  Of course, the Empresses' rule is hardly lax either, but we at least know what we are dealing with.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  At the very least, we are not afraid to extend our greetings at balls and banquets unlike that era. We would cower underneath the throne's imposing presence and frightfully worry whether we would be so unfortunate to witness that unreasonableness firsthand.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  It's hard to imagine...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=2)]
[name="Noble Attendant"]  It is indeed difficult if you haven't seen it with your own eyes.
[name="Noble Attendant"]  We don't talk about the past anymore. Now... we have a bright future ahead of us all.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1", name2="avg_npc_068", focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  A bright future, huh?
[name="Carnelian"]  Perhaps you are right. There is much that we can do.
[name="Carnelian"]  I wish we'll have a pleasant partnership.
[name="Carnelian"]  Now please excuse me.

[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#5",name2="avg_npc_069#4",focus=1)]

[name="Carnelian"]  No buts.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069#4",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  Uh... O-Okay.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  Are you not from around here...?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  I'm from Sargon. Have you heard of Sargon?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  No...
[name="Girl"]  What is it like?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  It's very, very far away. And it's a place of freedom.
[name="Carnelian"]  There are deserts there, as well as rainforests. Lords ameer big and small lead their own territories, and everyone there gets to live a peaceful life as long as they can pay their tribute. There are also places so remote that you can't find them on maps.
[name="Carnelian"]  In those places, we take care of ourselves.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  I've never heard of a place like that.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  That's to be expected.
[name="Carnelian"]  When I first came to Leithanien, I even doubted this country existed in the same world as my homeland.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  That sounds so mysterious...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Do you find that hard to believe?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  No, it's just a little hard to imagine.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Haha, I guess it'd be hard to visualize a place when you haven't seen a it with your own eyes.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  (Come to think of it... I said something similar not too long ago.)
[name="Carnelian"]  (I have to admit. The phony noble attendant might just be right.)
[name="Carnelian"]  (......)

[name="Carnelian"]  Hmm? Oh... I spaced out again.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]

[name="Carnelian"]  I could've run off, but he definitely wouldn't be able to take care of himself, so I stayed to help him out.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  I thought you said it was a troublesome person? Why are you taking care of him? Have you two become friends?

[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Okay, that's for another time. Looks like the guards didn't come this way. You should be safe here for the moment, but I suggest you leave soon, just to be sure.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  ......
[name="Girl"]  Umm, is it okay if I ask you another question?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Of course.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  Are there any Infected in Sargon?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Yes.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  So they are there too...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  But they don't see the sick people as a scourge to be feared. At least not where I used to live.
[name="Carnelian"]  They're just sick, that's all. The beasts in the rainforest kill humans as well, and if you're out gathering fruits and ends up falling from a tree, you could hit your head and die, if you're unlucky. So what makes diseases so terrible?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  That's wonderful...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  It's not all smiles and sugar cubes. Life there is tough in most places. It's because of how tough it is that we don't worry about it so much.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  What about you? Does the lord here send guards after anyone who's infected?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  We didn't used to be like this...
[name="Girl"]  My parents worked the mines, and we lived in the area closest to the mining district. A lot of people there have gotten sick.
[name="Girl"]  All the older folks who work the mines get this disease in the end. Rocks begin to grow on their bodies, but they still have to keep working.
[name="Girl"]  Anyone who has just a bit more money wouldn't ever set foot on our street. Anyone who's not sick yet tries to move out of the area...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  It sounds almost like a quarantine zone.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  A little, but I heard you have to pay to move into the better quarantine zones. They even hand out bread there. That's something that we can only dream of.
[name="Girl"]  But at least we can live there.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Live how? A mine worker, like your parents, would never step outside your district?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  That isn't so bad... We have a roof over our heads, and we make a small living. That's more than enough to me.
[name="Girl"]  At least that's what I used to think.
[name="Girl"]  But then the mines collapsed. My parents didn't come back. The guards sealed off the streets and started rounding up everyone they saw.
[name="Girl"]  And then no one dared to go outside anymore. Everyone stayed inside, but the guards would also go door to door and force their way in... What have we done wrong?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6",name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  ......
[name="Carnelian"]  (So this is them dealing with it 'accordingly'...)
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#6",name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  A few kids and I sneaked out of a back alley behind an abandoned building while the guards were distracted. I know the men outside think that anyone who's sick has to die, but I don't want to die!
[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=15, ystrength=15, vibrato=20, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Girl"]  I... I'm scared...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  We made it to this area a couple days ago. There wasn't anywhere we could hide as a group, so we decided to split up.
[name="Girl"]  That was the last time I saw them, and now I'm all alone...
[name="Girl"]  I... I need to find them!
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=1)]

[character]
[name="Leithanian Caster"]  Lady of Sargon, why are you protecting an Infected?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1")]
[name="Carnelian"]  No special reason. I met her, and I thought I'd give her a helping hand.
[name="Carnelian"]  And what are you after?
[name="Carnelian"]  If the goal was simply to be rid of the Infected, they wouldn't need a Caster such as yourself to go through the trouble. You have been capturing the miners for the past two days. What exactly are your orders?
[character]
[name="Leithanian Caster"]  Are you investigating us?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1")]
[name="Carnelian"]  Nothing so serious. I'm only doing a cursory investigation before we actually sign the contract.
[name="Carnelian"]  I wouldn't have figured this out, but I had a little enlightenment earlier today, so I have a good idea of how much Sir Feuerbach has covered up, using you and his guards. Should I perhaps share this with everyone here right now?
[character]
[name="Leithanian Caster"]  ......

[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  Maybe that says something about what big ears you got, then.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#7",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  I'll take that as a compliment.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#7",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  That's not a... Whatever.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  I-Is this person... a specialist?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  Don't listen to her. My job is nothing that glamorous. I'm just a—
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Aren't you guys specialists that handle Infected problems? That's how you introduced yourselves, if I remember correctly.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  Don't forget you are one of us.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Ah... Yeah, I know.
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  (So half-hearted!)
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  (Hey, now. Don't make a fuss about everything. Anyway, everything's as you can see. Can I leave the girl to you people?)
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  (Well, no problem with that.)
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  (Considering your standing... It's not a good idea to bring her with you.)
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#7",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  (My, how dependable.)
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#7",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  (Stop playing with me already. That's another girl putting on the weeps because of you. How many times has it been?)
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  (I really don't get it. You keep saying you can't stir up any trouble, but you keep running into trouble head on every time.)
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1#7",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  (Haha, I wonder why. I'm not so sure.)
[name="Carnelian"]  (I'm just doing things according to my principles...)
[Character(name="avg_npc_069")]
[name="Girl"]  Excuse me...
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Hmm?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=2)]
[name="Girl"]  Will we... meet again?
[Character(name="avg_426_carnli_1",name2="avg_npc_069",focus=1)]
[name="Carnelian"]  Well...
[name="Carnelian"]  As long as you stay true to your beliefs now, I'm sure we will.

Those who are humble will always say, 'This is where I belong.'
Those who are egotistical will say, 'This place belongs to me.'
Life in Sargon is shaped by the shifting sands. Here stands a woman of Sargon who is certainly not an egotist, but definitely not humble either.
If you must change who you are to fit in, there is no need.
You needn't fit in.
Be yourself.
