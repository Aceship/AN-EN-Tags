We've arrived at the specified coordinates.
The target building's outside appearance matches the description outlined in the preliminary survey report.
Our team will now proceed into the building for an inspection. We may need to cut the transmission. Watch for flares, in case anything happens.

[name="Blue Poison"]  There's an entrance here. Hm, it doesn't look like the builders intended for this to be here.
[name="Blue Poison"]  The edges are pretty rough, like it was hacked open with an axe. Perhaps the bounty hunters did this? I heard some of them like to come 'treasure hunting' here.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  That's probably because they aren't Iberians...
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Right, ruins like this one are more than 'toxic' to those who got out of that alive.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  As for the ones that stayed behind... The Church, the Inquisition... They have no way to make it here.
[name="Glaucus"]  They already pay too high a price, and they wouldn't want to see any of this.
[name="Glaucus"]  It's just like how I never wanted to look at my legs when I was a kid. No matter how much I tried, they just couldn't run. Iberia as it is now doesn't want to see any of these broken parts.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]

[name="Glaucus"]  Your call.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  I'm thinking up. I'm not entirely sure why, but I feel up is the way to go. This place is like... a tower.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  A tower? How tall do you think it is? The part that stands above ground is at most three stories. What could its purpose be?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  In that case, I guess we should go down.

[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  This kind of technology only existed in the coastal towns of the past. You don't see them much in Iberia these days.
[name="Glaucus"]  What... are they for?
[name="Glaucus"]  For observation? To relay signals? Or could it be... for sightseeing?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Perhaps it was for locking people up.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  Possibly...
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  When we look at the Iberia of the past, we some see the technology that they left behind, like gold covered in dust.
[name="Blue Poison"]  Yet, during those radiant times, there were countless bones buried underneath El Dorado.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  I'm sorry...
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  What are you apologizing for? The bones of the Ægirs who took my ancestors away to Iberia have long been eroded by the sea waves.
[name="Blue Poison"]  I don't hate Iberia, nor do I hate the Ægir people. Now, I suppose I don't even hate myself as much anymore. This is all thanks to the Doctor and you, Glau.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  Does this technology... give you any bad memories?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  All I care about is whether this place will be of any use to Rhodes Island.
[name="Blue Poison"]  In the end, this is what we are here for, no?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  Right... We're here to scout out the surroundings, to analyze the data, and to confirm what we can retrieve.
[name="Glaucus"]  Too bad that this place has been torn apart inside and out, though. If it was just the time and the environment, the parts wouldn't be this wrecked.

[name="Glaucus"]  So this place was flooded twice, then?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  The seawater destroyed the building the first time around. Whatever its function was, that was when it failed. The second time, the seawater gushed into this place again, flooding its insides once more.
[name="Blue Poison"]  And this poor bastard happened to be in here at the time. He likely thought he'd hit the jackpot, and was happily tearing away at the things in the wall.
[name="Blue Poison"]  He didn't manage to escape in time when the seawater began to flood the building, and the seagrass had his arms and legs caught. He lost his life after struggling for a while.
[name="Blue Poison"]  You can't really blame him. He was a Kuranta.

[name="Glaucus"]  We... don't talk about that. That's not allowed in Iberia.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  It's hard to kick your habits. We don't talk much about... our homeland at Rhodes Island. Besides, each of us has a different impression of that incident, and sometimes even about that whole area.
[name="Glaucus"]  I've talked to Weedy about it. Both of us are Ægirs who grew up in Iberia, and I've come to realize the Iberia in her eyes is totally different from the one I see.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  That's nothing strange, no? If you are not allowed to discuss the incident, then the only thing you will remember of it is the small fragment that you saw with your own eyes.
[name="Blue Poison"]  They... are taking the chance to piece the fragments together, from the people.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  Hm, there's only the two of us now. I could talk about it, but... I'm afraid to do that. It's like something has my throat blocked.
[name="Glaucus"]  I'm worried that as soon as I talk, the shadows cast on the path here will charge toward me.
[name="Glaucus"]  And I say that even though I know it's just shadows cast by the Originium lamp.

[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Everyone feels that way.
[name="Blue Poison"]  I suppose this pitch-black, sealed-off building is protecting us.
[name="Blue Poison"]  There's a dead body here, and we don't know what lies ahead. But this keeps me even more at ease than a wide open space.
[name="Blue Poison"]  The walls here give us a false sense of security, a sense that everything's under our control.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  You're right. At least there isn't another pair of eyes staring at us.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Now I'm not sure about that.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  Stop trying to scare me...
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Okay, okay. I'll stop. Back to the topic of the disaster. The Inquisition isn't actually to blame for that decision. The decision to not talk about that was made by the Ægirs who came ashore.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  Huh?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  I guess it was a form of self protection.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  Self... protection?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Do you know why the Ægirs came ashore?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  I... don't know. I thought we were meant to be here to begin with, though it seems most Iberians don't agree with that.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  I'm not too familiar either.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  Yeah... but you know more than we do, at the very least.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  It's funny. The history slowly disappeared from the Ægirs' memories, and we are the ones who still remember any of it.
[name="Blue Poison"]  My ancestors were taken away by the Ægirs some hundred years ago. They wanted the 'toxic' ability that we are born with.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  Why... is that?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  They kept extracting the toxins for experiments. They were trying to figure out whether these subterranean toxins could be used as some kind of weapon...
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  What were they trying to attack with that?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  I have no idea. How could I have seen it? From my elders tell me, it was an enormous, terrifying monster that doesn't exist on land.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  It's from the sea...
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  All I can say is that's extraordinarily likely.
[name="Blue Poison"]  I thought about asking the Doctor or Dr. Kal'tsit... or even the hunters directly.
[name="Blue Poison"]  Once, I happened upon Operator Skadi. This question immediately rose to the top of my mind.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  I doubt she'd tell you...
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Right, I don't think so either, and I didn't ask her in the end.
[name="Blue Poison"]  I'm not sure I have the courage to find out the truth...
[name="Blue Poison"]  Just like the Ægirs who came ashore, it took them several hundred years to forget that fear. That's how they could finally put down roots with their minds at ease to slowly become a part of Iberia.
[name="Blue Poison"]  No one would cast aside a new life they earned for themselves to fight what could be an endless war. Especially not when nobody knows when that disaster would actually strike, and when it actually strikes, everything could still be futile.
[name="Blue Poison"]  Even I wish that I could live a new life, even after the Doctor has taught me so much.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  In that case... perhaps we should turn back, then?
[name="Glaucus"]  We can still make it.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Perhaps.
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  You're still going straight ahead...
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Oh, you're right. I'm still going straight.
[name="Blue Poison"]  Thinking back, after all these years, I haven't once thought of giving up my abilities to use my toxin.
[name="Blue Poison"]  Perhaps I've never managed to break free of the souls of those Ægirs who enslaved my ancestors, and, deep down in my heart, I believe that the toxins in me will get the enemies they're meant for.

A bolt whizzes through the air.
It strikes the fuzzy white light. No, not quite. Just as it was about to strike the object, its trajectory curved to the side.
It's no problem. No one can see it. The bolt split in two soon after it was shot, one in the front, and one in the back, capturing the white light.
The very next moment, the white light suddenly expands.

[name="Aria"]  The mechanical parts, the central control system, the power circuits, the automation core, the outside wall Hologram emitter, and the wireless communications were all fine.
[name="Aria"]  My teacher would take me around the lighthouse every day to inspect and maintain everything, according to the manual. We even repaired the outside walls regularly.

[name="Aria"]  Under the night sky, a multitude of intersecting courses in the sea lit up by the lighthouse.
[name="Aria"]  All the grand drilling rigs and sea forts glimmering in the dark as ships large and small come and go in their surroundings... It was far more bustling than any city on land and far more radiant than even when the sun burned its brightest...
[name="Aria"]  If you got close enough, you could even see the underwater cities that the Iberian Ægirs built along the continental shelf.
[Character(name="avg_469_indigo_1#6")]
[name="Aria"]  —
[name="Aria"]  All of this was possible thanks to the thousands of lighthouses that stood on the Iberian coastline.

[name="Aria"]  Now, disaster struck our energy system. None of the lighthouses can ever light up again as they once did.
[name="Aria"]  Yet my teacher and I stayed to tend to the lighthouse.
[name="Aria"]  Every night, my teacher would try to light it. The signal lamp doesn't work, so we made a new light source.
[name="Aria"]  Our light source may not be able to stand in for a real lighthouse and illuminate the whole sea around us, only a small corner.

[name="Glaucus"]  She passed out. What's the matter?

[name="Blue Poison"]  (Shrugs)
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  Oh... did she get poisoned?
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Here I was thinking that Phidia is immune to my toxins, like you are.
[name="Blue Poison"]  Though it looks like it just took longer for it to affect her.
[name="Blue Poison"]  (How should I say this? Perhaps her body isn't special in anyway. She's just... a little slow?)
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=1)]
[name="Glaucus"]  (Let's not analyze this right now. D-Do you have an antidote? You're out on a mission with me alone, so you got to have one, right...?)
[Character(name="avg_326_glacus_1", name2="avg_129_bluep_1", focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Relax. The paralysis is temporary.
[name="Blue Poison"]  Let's head outside. She should come around after she gets a little breeze.

[name="Elysium"]  —
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_129_bluep_1",focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  No need to worry. Our investigation was a success.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_129_bluep_1",focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  So why can I hear a third person? Sounds like a young lady with whom I've not had the pleasure...
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_129_bluep_1",focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  We met her at the mission location. Her name is Aria, and she gave us some valuable information. She'll be coming with us to Rhodes Island to hand PR her resume.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_469_indigo_1",focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  Ah, well, let me welcome you in advance!

[name="Aria"]  H-Hello...
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_129_bluep_1",focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Right, in conclusion, this was a lighthouse.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_129_bluep_1",focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  Hm? A lighthouse? Did I hear that right? Our informant said it was 'really complicated by the looks.'
[name="Elysium"]  (I thought it was some important facility...)
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_129_bluep_1",focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  It was built before that disaster in Iberia.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_129_bluep_1",focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  I get it now...
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_129_bluep_1",focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  The inner structure is still pretty intact, though the related technologies suffered heavy damage. We don't know for sure how much we can retrieve from here.
[name="Blue Poison"]  And let the engineering team following this up know—
[name="Blue Poison"]  This place has the potential to become a new Rhodes Island office.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_129_bluep_1",focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  Okay...
[name="Elysium"]  *Sigh*... If this actually ends up becoming a new office, I will probably have to run back and forth all the time, won't I?
[name="Elysium"]  And it's so close to that place too...
[name="Elysium"]  Well, I guess we don't exactly have much choice. We aren't the only ones that need this, either. The informant said there's been some refugees who escaped the destroyed towns to the south. They have a tough journey ahead, and they'll need someone to look out for them.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_129_bluep_1",focus=2)]
[name="Blue Poison"]  Right. Perhaps this lighthouse... will end up being fairly useful.
[name="Blue Poison"]  We can provide medical services for the Infected in the area and help those in need, and we can... watch the tides that draw towards the land closer and closer day after day.
[CharacterCutin(widgetID="1",block=true)]
[Character(name="avg_129_bluep_1")]
[name="Blue Poison"]  It may not shine upon the area anymore... but it can still watch over this coastline.
