This place will no longer shelter you.
Begone, dear warrior. Turn about and flee. Your pitiful destiny is already set in stone. You have no place in this world any longer.
Indeed, your existence has no meaning for us anymore.
......Thus, the warrior fled. She, who never once trembled in fear under the thundering of the enemy's drums, who never faltered against the roars of her cruel opponents, turned and ran.

Days of unending rain would sicken even the most tenacious of young warriors.
Not to mention this pitiable fellow, sunken to the darkest depths of despair.
What sort of experiences would have forced her to leave her home at such a young age?
What happened to her, such that her heart would ache in sadness whenever she looks back at her homeland?
She wishes no one to know.
Go on, flee. Head to that unknown land.

[name="???"]  What's the situation?
[Character(name="avg_npc_053")]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  Just stopped moving. She's been struggling there for two hours already, moved about ten meters since we found her.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  If she really was a competent spy, she'd be playing dead to conserve her energy instead of drawing our attention like this.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  It could also all be an act, to play on the Minoans' sympathy and lower their guard.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",blackstart2=0.3,blackend2=0.5,focus=2)]
[name="???"]  Yes, the Minoans would have trouble ignoring such a weight on the conscience. What do you think of this foreign warrior, and what she's done?
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",blackstart2=0.3,blackend2=0.5,focus=1)]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  Hmph, just a trick.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  She's definitely acting. You know it's Sargon's fault, their tricks and lies, that these villages took so long to...
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",blackstart2=0.3,blackend2=0.5,focus=2)]

[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  In short, she's at death's door.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  Looks like she was crossing over from Sargon, judging by her weapon and equipment. Now, she just looks like a fish out of water, struggling helplessly on Minoan soil.

[Delay(time=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  What is it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_053")]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  It's not my job to say what's what, but since the Minoans hired me and appointed you to take command, I'll just remind you—
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  You're not a normal nurse, but neither are you a naive priestess who knows nothing but sympathy and forgiveness.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  You're the commander of the Minoans, mentor to the budding warriors, the so-called 'Goddess' worshipped by all these Minoan villages.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  If you take her in, everyone must treat her with the same amount of respect and devotion that they give to you. After all, you were the one who found her.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  Yet this little warrior is, without the slightest hint of doubt, of Sargon——
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  Until there is peace with Sargon, she remains an enemy to Minoans, one they have to stay wary of.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  ......
[name="Pallas"]  Warrior, your words carry your intentions well, and reveal the breadth of your knowledge. I listen out of respect and duty.
[name="Pallas"]  But as you know, there exists a divide between your judgment and mine. It is a saddening reality, but it is one we must face.
[name="Pallas"]  I am indeed considering taking her in, and treating her wounds at the least.
[name="Pallas"]  Hers is a young life, one hanging by a thread. And I believe she means us no harm.
[name="Pallas"]  As for whether thousands of Sargon's soldiers lurk behind her shadow, that is for you to determine.
[name="Pallas"]  In the absence of danger, we may not fall upon the ongoing war as an excuse to abandon another's life.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  (How pointless.)
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  Some may think this a pointless act. That is why I let the others return to their duties, while you remain here, watching over her.
[name="Pallas"]  Sarkaz, oh poor Sarkaz. Your callous demeanor is known far and wide, and you rely on it for survival. In other words, many among you take pride in your indifference.
[name="Pallas"]  One must heel to one's proficiencies. I give my orders based on this principle.
[name="Pallas"]  You need only ensure your mission is completed. As for other matters... they will be resolved, one way or the other.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  Since you refuse to change your mind even after listening to me, wouldn't it be the same if someone else was looking after her?
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  You've been working as a mercenary here for three months now. I'm sure you're aware of the situation.
[name="Pallas"]  If it were left to the Minoans, this would be over in ten minutes, much less two hours. Their guilt would gnaw at those pure hearts of theirs, bidding them to lend a hand, regardless of the danger...
[name="Pallas"]  In such a scenario, how badly shaken would those sincere hearts of theirs be, if that betrayal really came to fruition?
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  Hah. In the end, even you admit that those villagers are way too soft-hearted, to value the life of a potential enemy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  I understand you, Sarkaz. Some of the villagers have accepted you, and the elders view you as one of our own. You have their goodwill to thank for that.
[name="Pallas"]  However, your needs do not lay there. Between love, or at least this love that exists between we of different races, and the payment of money that you receive, you do not believe that it is worthless.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  There's nothing to discuss about that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  You live life your own way, and I have never questioned that.
[name="Pallas"]  But I think that Sarkaz demeanor I mentioned——perhaps you were like that, once. When we first met, you harbored a kindness not altogether pure, and a heart not completely vile.
[name="Pallas"]  Yet, that has changed. Your interactions with the Minoan soldiers and the villagers have spurred your thoughts. You have become an intelligent warrior brandishing your weapon of your own free will.
[name="Pallas"]  Your vigilance is warranted. It's just that I believe Sargon has no reason to attack right now, and neither is there a need to use such crude 'bait.'
[name="Pallas"]  Rather than formulating a trap to prey on others' kindness, the Sargon's troops would be far more willing to march in brashly, declaring their cruel intentions to plunder and slaughter for all to hear.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  Right, right. Let's just go with what you said.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  For now, let us turn our eyes to this young warrior who's wandered over from Sargon.
[name="Pallas"]  Just as you said, though I wish to save her...
[name="Pallas"]  Just as you warned, it would be far from prudent to simply bring her back to the villages.
[name="Pallas"]  She has no visibly open wounds, and it does not seem to be any complex disease that would require surgery.
[name="Pallas"]  I will attempt to treat her wounds. The consequences of this will be mine to bear.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  You mean you want me to put up a tent here, so you can treat her wounds? In this place not even two kilometers from the border? Even the garrison is farther away!
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  Well, there's not much difference with the garrison anyway...
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  Don't forget your place. You're the villagers' beacon of hope, the one who will free them from the threat of Sargon.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  They love you, and call you the 'Goddess of Victory', yet here you are taking such risks...
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  Watch your words, soldier.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  ...Tch.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  A young woman whose guilt is yet unproven, who has waited for over two hours, struggling to keep herself awake, all for the sake of survival.
[name="Pallas"]  She has already passed your test——As the keenest and most vigilant Sarkaz, you are unable to bring out solid evidence of her duplicity.
[name="Pallas"]  And so, my heart is already filled with guilt. I cannot bear to leave her any longer.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  I don't object, if you really insist on it. But... it's hard to say if that girl will even talk to you like this after she wakes up.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  Just be prepared for an attack once she wakes up.

She drags her body onward with naught but sheer determination, but in the end her vision disappears in a fog of darkness.

[name="Pallas"]  Oh, definitely not! I will not be using that as a bargaining chip in our discussion. In fact, I will lay my own weapon on the floor.
[name="Pallas"]  Observe! Dear traveler from Sargon, please feel free to partake in this nutritious food. I am fully convinced that you are unrelated to our true enemies.
[name="Pallas"]  In consideration to your current state, this free and delicious meal should not be left for too long, regardless of any choice you may make later on.

[Character(name="avg_npc_053")]
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  They went for lunch a while time ago. They'll probably be drinking wine, singing and reciting poetry right after too, so they got me to help stand guard here.
[Character(name="avg_482_pallas_1")]
[name="Pallas"]  Ah, it appears that my admonishments were still not taken seriously. I had wanted to show you the magnanimity of the Minoan soldiers...

[name="Sarkaz Mercenary"]  The villages of Akroti are not safe for you. If you are running from something and want to avoid trouble, you should probably leave now.

[name="Pallas"]  (*sigh* The blame for exposing me lies with you, Sarkaz warrior.)
[name="Pallas"]  It is not a name worth remembering, at least for now.
[name="Pallas"]  Although, there are such stories——On the border of Minos, a priestess bears the revelations of the twelve heroes, arriving to protect the honor and freedom of the Minoans, taking up the fight against Sargon's invasions and always able to clutch victory from the jaws of defeat...
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]

[name="Pallas"]  *cough*—*cough* *cough*... W-Well, I suppose the war has not yet been won.
[name="Pallas"]  Apologies, I had no intention of declaring that name. I only hope that these myths of Minos may spread to Sargon as well, such that we can come to understand each other better.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  You should save those words for the next visitor from Sargon passing by.

[name="Pallas"]  *Sniff*... Fine. It seems that besides wishing you well, there is nothing else we can do for you, traveler from Sargon.
[name="Pallas"]  I will gift you this working compass.
[name="Pallas"]  Though you know not where you are going... You must continue moving onwards. That is the only goal you have now, and the only way to escape your suffering.
[name="Pallas"]  To move onwards is a choice, one most miraculous. I believe that you will receive much help on your journey, traveler.
[name="Pallas"]  When the next kindly person appears, one who can devote their energies to you, one who can save you from the most dangerous of mountains, one who can help you escape the clutches of Death... You may make your choice then, or even decide to accompany them.

[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#3")]
[name="Heavyrain"]  Forget it... it doesn't really matter.
[name="Heavyrain"]  Maybe the destination of this journey is the journey itself.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#3",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Pallas"]  I will pray for you, young lady. The road you tread stretches far, very far indeed.
[name="Pallas"]  You are a warrior. A brave, persevering warrior. Your bravery is etched on your weapon, etched on your limbs, etched in your very soul itself.
[name="Pallas"]  Though your eyes are hazy now, a strong rain will wash it all away and your vision will be clear once more.
[name="Pallas"]  I apologize for not being able to devote myself to the task of earning your trust. We all have the same, more important things to do.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#3",name2="avg_482_pallas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  I'm still suspicious of you.
[Character(name="avg_482_pallas_1")]
[name="Pallas"]  You, me, and that adorable Sarkaz warrior. We are all on a journey without a destination, struggling and suffering to move onwards for the sake of our souls, even as we seek that one thing we must experience, that most important thing——
[name="Pallas"]  To find a place for ourselves.

[name="Pallas"]  No, it's exactly the opposite. She's normal through and through.
[name="Pallas"]  She's normal, yet she hurries along, as if running away from some evil spirit while keeping everyone at arm's length.
[name="Pallas"]  She does not seem predisposed to such behavior. I would presume that a great change has occurred recently, one that has left her despondent.

[name="Pallas"]  It's just as you said, Mister Sarkaz. It's difficult to discern one's heart, and my fateful encounter with our Kuranta visitor was sadly lacking in depth.
[name="Pallas"]  Even so, you and I have witnessed her fragility——Her fortitude is bent and broken, and she is at her most vulnerable right now. There isn't much we can do for her, with a good breakfast being the greatest courtesy we can confer.
[name="Pallas"]  Even so, even so. That poor Kuranta soldier. Her only pursuit right now, is the power to grasp her own fate. To choose a destination of her own, or to end it on her own terms.
[name="Pallas"]  No matter what, she possesses the same goal as ourselves. To search for freedom, that is our mission.
[name="Pallas"]  Try as I may, I am unable to imagine how vile it must be, that evil spirit behind the loss of her freedom. I never believed I would face such a saddening scene.
