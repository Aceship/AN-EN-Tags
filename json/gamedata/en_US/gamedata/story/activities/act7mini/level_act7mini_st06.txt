[Character(name="avg_173_slchan_1",name2="char_199_yak_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"]  Ah, the Young Lady. Good morning.
[name="Matterhorn"]  Have you gotten used to life at Rhodes Island yet? It's rare to see you up so early though... Are you getting ready for a mission?
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="char_199_yak_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  Or are you not used to the beds here? After all, I do recall you having very high standards for your sleep environment.
[name="Courier"]  Back at the old house, Matterhorn helped pick out a bed for you when you were still very young, right? After that, you refused to sleep anywhere else.... and never without hugging your little blanket.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="char_199_yak_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"]  Mm, now that you remind me...

[Character(name="avg_173_slchan_1#4",name2="char_199_yak_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  Don't underestimate an adventurer either, got it? I've got no problem going early to bed, early to rise! If you can't get a good night's rest to replenish your energy when you're up in the mountains, there's no way you'll ever become a good mountaineer!
[name="Cliffheart"]  No matter how cold it is, no matter how thin the air is, you bet I can fall right asleep!

[Character(name="avg_173_slchan_1",name2="char_199_yak_1#5",focus=1)]

[name="Cliffheart"]  Alright, let's stop talking about this already!
[name="Cliffheart"]  Anyway, the fact that you two are headed out this early with these packages, are you going on a mission?
[name="Cliffheart"]  Hmm, and with this amount of luggage, it's looking like a pretty long trip too... Heading back home?
[Character(name="avg_173_slchan_1",name2="char_199_yak_1",focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"]  That's right. We'll be getting ready to leave shortly.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  Yup. We have to bring some stuff back over there. Master SilverAsh has quite a lot of things to deal with, and Matterhorn and I will be going back to help out.
[name="Courier"]  Lady Ensia, is there anything you'd like us to take back to Master SilverAsh? Matterhorn and I would be more than glad to help.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  I'm afraid that depends on the situation. If it's something dangerous, I might have to tell Master SilverAsh.

[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  Hmph! Whatever, I'm gonna tell you anyway. It's not anything dangerous, so you'd better swear not to tell him anything!

[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  Not that I know, so far. It all depends on Master SilverAsh's arrangements. There's no saying whether Mister Gnosis and Lady Degenbrecher have plans of their own, either.
[name="Courier"]  Why are you suddenly asking about this though? Is it related to Lady Enya again?
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  Mhm. I really can't keep anything from you.
[name="Cliffheart"]  Actually, I wrote a letter to my sister...
[name="Cliffheart"]  Back home, my brother controlled things too strictly, and I wasn't even able to sneak out to see her. I didn't even get to see her before I left for Rhodes Island.
[name="Cliffheart"]  It's only gotten harder. I haven't seen Enya in the longest time!
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  Lady Ensia...
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  So... Courier, would you be able to help me deliver this letter to Mount Karlan?
[name="Cliffheart"]  I just want to ask her how she's doing, and if it's hard being a Saintess. I also want to tell her that she doesn't have to worry about me... just stuff like that. I swear I didn't write anything outrageous!
[name="Cliffheart"]  My brother couldn't care less about this, and he hasn't had a proper conversation with me in ages. As for Uncle Matterhorn, all he'd do is try to console me into waiting some more...
[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=15, ystrength=15, vibrato=20, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]

[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#2",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  Knowing too much isn't necessarily a good thing. The Master is looking out for you, and does not wish to burden you. Sending you to Rhodes Island was another way for him to protect you.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  He's always like that.
[name="Cliffheart"]  He always keeps me in the dark, saying that he's doing this or that for our own good. In the end, my sister still left our home for Mount Karlan.

[name="Courier"]  Lady Ensia...
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  But at least promise me, don't mention a single word of this to my brother, okay? He's gonna give me an earful for sure if he finds out, and my ears are gonna fall off if I have to sit through another one of his lectures!
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  If Master SilverAsh heard your opinions of him, I'm sure he would be heartbroken.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  As if! He has more important things to attend to after all, hmph!
[name="Cliffheart"]  In any case, I won't keep you any longer. I've gotta find Closure first and ask if the stuff I wanted came in... Hmm, but if I went down to see her this early, do you think she'd just shoo me out?
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  Judging by Closure's typical schedule, there's a good chance that she just fell asleep and won't be responding to any knocks on the door.

[name="Cliffheart"]  Good point. Maybe I'll wait 'til later then.

[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=1)]

[name="Courier"]  It's too late to stay silent now. 'I thought I didn't tell anyone' is what you wanted to say, right?

[name="Cliffheart"]  Urgh...
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  After realizing that I wouldn't help deliver the letter for you, you prepared all this cold-weather mountain-climbing gear and took on a mission that would put you closest to Kjerag.
[name="Courier"]  After finishing the mission, you'd let the rest of the team head back to Rhodes Island first and take a little detour to 'take care of some personal matters.'
[name="Courier"]  Such is my Lady Ensia, you certainly do act with great decisiveness.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  But, I still ended up getting caught...
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#3",focus=1)]

[name="Cliffheart"]  Ugh.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  Lady Ensia, are you planning to scale Mount Karlan again with only your bare hands?
[name="Courier"]  Or, do you plan on barging into the Saintess's residence to deliver your letter, with no consideration for your own safety?
[name="Courier"]  Have you considered what would happen if you made a fuss before the Vine-Bear Court?
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  ......
[name="Cliffheart"]  Ever since I was little, every time I'd try to sneak out to play, you and my brother would always catch me. I never thought I'd be able to keep anything from you two.
[name="Cliffheart"]  You're exactly right. That is my plan. Since I faced down Mount Karlan once, I can do it a second time.

[name="Cliffheart"]  But if I'm powerless, what else am I to do?!
[name="Cliffheart"]  I'm always powerless... Powerless to stop the rift between my brother and Enya from growing wider and wider. And I'm expected to just let it happen!
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  On the day that Enya left home, I was hiding along the side. I knew she didn't want to go, and we both thought that big brother would protect us, but he didn't lift a finger... He didn't stop those people from taking Enya away.
[name="Cliffheart"]  I thought my sister would cry, but she didn't.
[name="Cliffheart"]  When I saw her walk out that door, in my heart, I wished that she would've cried out.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  ......
[name="Courier"]  Master SilverAsh... also suffers his own hardships.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  I know. Even though the two of you never tell me anything, I'm not stupid. I can see it.
[name="Cliffheart"]  Ever since he came back from Victoria and founded that company, even you and Uncle Matterhorn have been getting busier. I understand.
[name="Cliffheart"]  I don't want to blame my brother. But, Courier, have you ever seen the Saintess of Kjerag?
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  Lady Enya? No, you mean, the 'Saintess.'
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  Correct. The Kjerag Saintess.
[name="Cliffheart"]  I have, on one occasion. From a distance.
[name="Cliffheart"]  At first, I was so excited to finally get a chance to see my big sister, but... the only thing I saw was the Saintess of Mount Karlan, standing there as if frozen in ice. From where I stood, there was nothing of my sister.
[name="Cliffheart"]  Ever since then, I knew that Enya could not possibly have been living the life she wanted atop Mount Karlan.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  We may have difficulty understanding each others' points of view from our current positions, but... I think Lady Enya is a different person now, you can't look at her like you did then.
[name="Courier"]  The Saintess is very important to Kjerag, and honestly, Lady Enya's situation may not be so bad. She stands to be the master of an entire religion, the very faith of Kjerag...
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  That's not the same. Not at all.
[name="Cliffheart"]  You can say that the Saintess is noble, exalted, capable of being detached from our feelings. But our relationship is so much more important— we're literally sisters!
[name="Cliffheart"]  As siblings, if we never try to understand each other, or even worse, end up becoming enemies one day, what are we going to do then?!
[name="Cliffheart"]  I can't just wait until that day finally comes. I'm scared... so I have to do something.
[name="Cliffheart"]  Even if, even if it's something as simple as asking Enya how she's doing...
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  And, what if it's not what you want to hear?

[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#2",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  That's true. I can only pray that the worst will never come to pass. Just thinking about you climbing up the mountain to kidnap her... Ughh, just thinking about it is giving me a headache.
[name="Courier"]  Looks like you won't change your mind no matter what I say, right?
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  That's right.
[name="Cliffheart"]  I'm not joking. If I say I'll do it, I'll do it!
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  Even if I insist on stopping you, or reporting this matter to Master SilverAsh—
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  Even if my brother objects, even if he wants to lock me up, I won't give in. You'd better not underestimate me, because it's not that simple to shut me down!

[name="Courier"]  Hand that letter over to me.
[name="Courier"]  I'd rather not live with the constant worry of wondering when you're going to do something foolish. It's better for me to help you figure out a solution, not to mention safer too.
[name="Courier"]  *Sigh*... You're really putting me in a rough spot here, Lady Ensia.

[name="Courier"]  Haha, if only the Master was so easy to convince.
[name="Courier"]  (whispers) But... this might not be such a bad thing either.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  Huh? What'd you say?
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  Nothing in particular. Just thinking out loud.
[name="Courier"]  But let me say this in advance, even if I agreed to help, the most I can do is deliver the letter to the nearby monastery and then see if there's any way to get it up the mountain.
[name="Courier"]  That place is as close as we can get to the area controlled by the Vine-Bear Court. Any higher up into the mountain... and that is no longer a place you can come and go at will.
[name="Courier"]  I cannot guarantee that your letter will reach Lady Enya.
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=2)]
[name="Cliffheart"]  No problem! The fact that you're willing to help means we at least have a shot... If it doesn't work, I'll just think up some other way!
[Character(name="char_198_blackd_1",name2="avg_173_slchan_1",focus=1)]
[name="Courier"]  I hope whatever you think up doesn't involve climbing up there.
