[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  What’s gonna happen if they really start calling themselves Reunion?
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  They definitely will.
[name="Mudrock"]  We’ll be hunted down.
[name="Mudrock"]  A town of this size can’t do anything to us. But... What if it was an entire nomadic city?
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=2)]
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  If we took just one of the big Leithanien bankers, musicians, or aristocrats out of their fancy towers, we’d be set for life.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Pride will ruin them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=2)]
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  It’s the same pride that keeps Leithania’s aggressive streak in check.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  We should avoid making trouble in Wolumonde. We will have nowhere else to go.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  We should not meet on the battlefield. This... this is no battlefield. Is it?
[name="Mudrock"]  You, all of you, your time grows short.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=2)]
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Um...? Who are you talking to?
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  No.
[name="Mudrock"]  Just... musing.
[name="Mudrock"]  Winter is coming. And we will have no choice.

[name="Severin"]  Now, any more questions?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Just to be sure, how did you identify the eight corpses, Officer Severin? 
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  Body type, sex, approximate age, a list of the town’s missing persons.
[name="Severin"]  But now is not the time to discuss the fire. We have more pressing issues at hand.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I don’t disagree, but...
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  What have you got?
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  The number of Infected people who lost their lives in the fire was “four,” according to the Reunion member we spoke to.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  Is there a reason we should care what the enemy has to say?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  With all due respect, this does matter. “Caring” what he says is different from “trusting” it. We have a major risk of misunderstanding here.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  I still don’t think this will solve the problem. Uncovering the truth about the fire will not improve our situation.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  It means a lot to me.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  Then, with all due respect, Miss Folinic, you’ve been letting your emotions pull you around too much.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  But you must—
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  I fight for Wolumonde and Wolumonde alone. That is my duty. I’m not here to serve the justice in your heart.
[name="Severin"]  I have a responsibility to give the truth to Rhodes Island, not your thirst for revenge.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  You—
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#2")]
[name="Folinic"]  —No, you’re right...
[name="Folinic"]  I need to go calm down... I, I’ll go help Lisa with the wounded.

[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  Then it’s settled. Our top priority is to retake Zwölftontechnik Strasse.
[name="Severin"]  War is inevitable, at this point. Rhodes Island will need to focus on the fight for the automated Arts units, all while keeping a close eye on the Sarkaz and other partisans.
[name="Severin"]  Direct crowd control will be on us. The most difficult jobs, we give to you.

[name="Ayerscarpe"]  ......
[Character(name="char_294_ayer", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  Erm, did I say too much?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  No. Tell me, what did you see in their eyes? The insurgents, and the angry townspeople.
[name="GreyThroat"]  If they managed to overwhelm us, that would be the end of the town of Wolumonde.
[name="GreyThroat"]  And regardless of what the truth may be, headlines around the world would read “Reunion resurfaces and destroys a town in Leithania.”
[name="GreyThroat"]  After so many sacrifices, so many goodbyes, I did not want to see it happen again.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Ayerscarpe, contact Click. It’s time to regroup.
[name="GreyThroat"]  I’m going to check on the Infected captives.

[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Infected Captive"]  Is that a joke? I’m a Leithanien. An educated Leithanien. How could I—
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#2")]
[name="Suzuran"]  No fighting!
[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Infected Captive"]  No, it’s not about fighting. Without Arts, I can’t even use my refrigerator!
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#2")]
[name="Suzuran"]  You just use it normally, through the device. Don’t irritate the Originium in your body. That way, you don’t worsen your infection!
[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]

[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#4")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Okay, okay. Just remember to take care of yourself so you don’t get worse. You’re still pretty healthy. And no more using Arts!
[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Infected Captive"]  We’re fighting against... Never mind. What can I say to a child...?

[stopmusic(fadetime=3)]
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Oh, an old man? What’s he doing here at his age...?
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  Heh heh. A nine-tailed Vulpo. That’s something you don’t see every day.
[name="Old Man"]  Hm. That reminds me. I’ve been hearing a lot of talk of Winterwisps and outlanders. Would that be you?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Oh, yes. Can you tell me where you’re hurt?
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  Hm? Oh, I’m not hurt. I’m just here to wait for death. I’m old, and getting sleepy...
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  D-death? Let’s not get too morbid here...
[Character]
[stopmusic(fadetime=3)]
[name="Old Man"]  Child, I’m a Winterwisp. Last of the Winterwisp clansmen, in fact.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  What?!
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  Heh heh. You're awfully cute when you're shocked, child… And, I sense no hostility from you.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  The last...? But everyone’s been saying the Winterwisps are helping the Infected rebels.
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  *Sigh*. It’s only when they’re so filled with hate that they think of their heritage. And that heritage is just an excuse. They hate something else altogether.
[name="Old Man"]  Would you indulge an old man for a minute? I’m already your prisoner, after all. I’m not going to do anything... ever again. I’m too old.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Oh, um... As old as you are, I should treat you. Even if it’s just a flesh wound.
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  Hah hah. I’m still pretty strong, in my old age... No, no. That’s a lie.
[name="Old Man"]  My clansmen mostly went elsewhere. Or they intermarried with the people of Wolumonde.
[name="Old Man"]  In the end, how many real Winterwisps are left? Just a few of us old fogies.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Sir... what did you do?
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  I... killed. Many people.
[playMusic(intro="$storyendjp_intro", key="$storyendjp_loop", volume=0.4)]
[name="Old Man"]  A traveling merchant who came to Wolumonde, a noble who dared to wander into the wilds... and so many more.
[name="Old Man"]  At first we thought it was justified. Proper vengeance...
[name="Old Man"]  So the old-timers did all the hard work. The younger ones just stood by. None of it meant anything to their lives anymore.
[name="Old Man"]  But vengeance. We couldn’t kill the traitors. We couldn’t kill the rotten nobles. It turns out, we could only unleash our hatred on so many innocents.
[name="Old Man"]  We couldn’t defeat Leithania. Not its laws, not the mighty roar of the engines of its nomadic cities.
[name="Old Man"]  We started giving up. I escaped into Wolumonde, and Severin picked off the other old clansmen one by one. He’s a hunter. Never wavers.
[name="Old Man"]  But they say he’ll sit with a dying enemy and have one last smoke with him. Too bad today’s manufactured cigarettes are awful.
[name="Old Man"]  As for me, I built myself a nest out of scavenged tin, underneath Wolumonde. Severin didn’t get the last one, in the end.
[name="Old Man"]  Am I afraid to die? Nay. Believe me, little Vulpo girl, I’m not afraid.
[name="Old Man"]  I just want to hear the sound of a town’s power plant roaring to life, after my own lifetime of fruitless revenge.
[name="Old Man"]  Maybe someday Wolumonde will grow into a nomadic city, or maybe it’ll die out.
[name="Old Man"]  But... Hah... I’m a Winterwisp. Was I furious the first time I saw that boiler heat up and send the town crawling away? Yes, but what could I do? I remember it. I just cried.
[name="Old Man"]  It surged, it scorched, it singed, unstoppable. What could I do with only my bow and a short sword? I fell in love with it... with this murder weapon...
[name="Old Man"]  But Biederman did it, treacherous boy. A Catastrophe Messenger, and an outsider, did what I’d never dare to do in my entire life...
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#2")]
[name="Suzuran"]  S-slow down, sir! Th-that Biederman you’re talking about...
[name="Suzuran"]  I remember a Catastrophe Messenger in Leithania by that name, but I think he died in the fire?
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  Hm? I’m not sure about that. He’s the one giving the orders.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  So that means...?
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  Do you know that feeling of powerlessness?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Huh?
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  When I watched Biederman... take the Infected, the Arts, the destruction... When I watched him ruin the power plant, I was completely powerless...
[name="Old Man"]  It turns out the thing that conquered us all those years ago was just a big hunk of iron... How weary I’ve become.
[name="Old Man"]  ...Are you still there?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Yes, I’m listening.
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  Don’t rush to revenge. Don’t fight. Listen to me, girl.
[name="Old Man"]  The Winterwisps aren’t the reason for all this... At least, not anymore.
[name="Old Man"]  How many here in Wolumonde have the Winterwisp blood in their veins? We were the ones who built this place in the beginning.
[name="Old Man"]  Winterwisp, Winterwisp is Wolumonde... It’s the moon... And they, they destroyed themselves...
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  So that’s the story.
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  Look, little Vulpo girl, do you see where the road leads?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Up ahead? It’s an ordinary road. It leads to the town hall.
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]  No...
[name="Old Man"]  It leads to the mountains.
[name="Old Man"]  The long banner flies... twelve twists and turns in the trail... travelers and blowing snow... ah... the power plant...
[name="Old Man"]  Ahh... ...
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Right. I forgot.
[name="Suzuran"]  That is the way to the mountains.
[name="Suzuran"]  Good night.
