Wolumonde, Leithania. Once a bustling hub of commerce, this nomadic town is now rarely seen by outsiders.

[name="Severin"]  Was I here when you decided my son’s fate?
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  Well... Tatjana should already have...
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5")]
[name="Severin"]  Yes, she told me. You had her tell me. I’m only reminding you what you’ve done.
[name="Severin"]  What’s the situation?
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066#5",focus=1)]
[name="Councilor"]  The Infected are still protesting. They’ve even started chasing off Infected newcomers.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066#5",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  What do they want?
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066#5",focus=1)]
[name="Councilor"]  They... they believe the fire was part of some kind of plot. They demand an explanation for Dr. Atro and the dead Infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066#5",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  A plot? An explanation? Great, someone must be riling them up.
[name="Severin"]  Even the Infected wouldn’t stoop that low. Most of them are from Wolumonde.
[name="Severin"]  Have they had any contact with that militant group out there?
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Councilor"]  None, for now.
[name="Councilor"]  But the militants have been lingering around the outskirts of the hamlet. I’m worried they might influence the protestors.

[name="Severin"]  Go ahead.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  Two? Infected?
[name="Councilor"]  They claim to be from Rhodes Island? I know that name—
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066#2",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  That would be Dr. Atro’s company. *Sigh.* We knew this was coming.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066#2",focus=1)]
[name="Councilor"]  Wh-what do we do?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#2")]
[name="Severin"]  Dr. Atro was a respectable Infected. They may be here looking for her. And they have a right to know the truth.
[name="Severin"]  Let them in.

[playsound(key="$d_gen_transmissionget", volume=0.6)]
[name="Councilor"]  ...You heard him. Do as he says.
[name="Councilor"]  Hmm, are you sure about this? What if they have something to do with the militants out there?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  Between the Great Rift, the fire, and the Infected, do we have the luxury to be suspicious of everyone who knocks on our door?
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  What about after they learn the truth? What if Rhodes Island seeks reparations from us? How much is Wolumonde to suffer?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  ...So what should we do?
[name="Severin"]  Lock our doors and send them away? Lie to them? Tell them Dr. Atro took some Oripathy patients out on a hike?
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  I know we can’t sweep it under the rug. But you don’t have the final say in this. We have to prepare for the worst.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#3")]
[name="Severin"]  No one has the final say on the truth, but... Never mind. Do as you will.
[name="Severin"]  I’m leaving.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066#3",focus=1)]
[name="Councilor"]  Leaving? Where are you going this time?
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066#3",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  ...I have a problem to solve.
[name="Severin"]  My only job is to get this town back on track. The decision-making process? I have little patience for your political games.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066#3",focus=1)]
[name="Councilor"]  Hey! Wait!
[name="Councilor"]  I know you’re suffering, and there’s so much we could’ve done better, but we had no choice!
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066#3",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  I understand. That’s why I’m still talking to you nice and peacefully.
[name="Severin"]  I’ll leave Rhodes Island to you. You’re good at these things. I’ll walk the blocks.
[name="Severin"]  That’s the deal.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  Severin! Severin Hawthorn! You are this town’s Schultz! You can’t be running all over the—
[name="Councilor"]  Ugh! Must he always...
[name="Councilor"]  Sigh...
[name="Councilor"]  Forget it. Tatjana, Severin, Thor. They’re all tragic figures, really.
[name="Councilor"]  Let’s get this place cleaned up. Rhodes Island will be here soon.

[name="Suzuran"]  Wolumonde. Its name means “The Eighth Moon,” and together with seven other nearby towns, it makes up Leithania’s flourishing northern trade network—
[name="Suzuran"]  That’s what the book said, anyway.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  From what I’m seeing, “flourishing trade” isn’t exactly how I’d describe it.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#4", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Could it be because of the “Great Rift” thing?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#4", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Yes. A Catastrophe of that scale is rare. It could be more than a thousand meters deep, with exposed active Originium on the cliffsides. I shudder just thinking about it.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  But, Miss Folinic... You were very curious what would happen if you lobbed a shell into it...
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Nay, that was just my academic curiosity speaking. Realistically, one wrong move and the entire plateau could get cleaved in half.
[name="Folinic"]  Considering the detour we had to take, looks like this town won’t be moving an inch.

[name="Townsfolk"]  Visitors at a time like this? And such strange clothes. I hope this isn’t an ill omen...
[name="Townsfolk"]  Look at her tails. Oh, and the crystals on her shoulder! Is she Infected?
[name="Townsfolk"]  But those clothes look familiar... Where have I seen them before...?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  M-Miss Folinic, can we really just walk down the street like this?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  The prevalence of Originium Arts in Leithania have brought two major benefits: first, the incredible music scene, and second, a broad tolerance of the Infected.
[name="Folinic"]  There may be restrictions on your personal freedom, but should you want to live, you can win back that right as long as you’re willing to pay the price.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  ...Price?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  At least it’s something affordable.
[name="Folinic"]  Wolumonde may be in the boonies and have its fair share of problems, but at least the Infected have a place to live... That’s what she told me anyway—
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Folinic"]  —Oh, someone’s coming.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  ...Hm?

[name="Severin"]  The Rathaus is just up ahead, right in front of the tallest tower. You see it? Good. Someone will meet you there.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1")]
[name="Folinic"]  Er, thanks. Can I ask your name...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  Me? I’m off duty.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  Um, what?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  I’m off duty. And I really don’t want to talk so much when I’m off... I have my own business to deal with.
