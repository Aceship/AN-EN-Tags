[name="Severin"]  But at least... they’ll have their scapegoat, and no excuse to keep fighting.
[name="Severin"]  But it’s not enough... Without an external force strong enough to clamp down on them, they’ll continue their cycle of revenge.
[name="Severin"]  So I request... Rhodes Island’s assistance... Even though we can’t afford to pay for it now.
[name="Severin"]  But if Wolumonde survives this disaster... we will repay you.

[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  I don’t have the authority to make promises on behalf of Rhodes Island. Saving a town of ten thousand people is beyond the scope of our mission, and way beyond the authority Amiya invested in me.
[name="Folinic"]  But, for Atro, “we” won’t abandon Wolumonde.

[name="GreyThroat"]  We found him on the “Gramophone” at coordinate B2.
[name="GreyThroat"]  There were visible wounds on the back of his head, and ice crystals remained on the surface of his skin. All signs indicated an Arts attack.
[name="GreyThroat"]  The operator on scene could not make an accurate determination, but wounds on the surrounding cadavers indicated that Biederman had died in the riot at least a few hours prior.

I watched as the smile on Folinic's face froze— Yes, that smile.
The loss of Operator Atro left her emotionally unstable, until we learned about Biederman.
No longer troubled with issues of colonialism, the Infected, or class, she simply, and happily, found her revenge.
Does she feel some momentary relief? Relief at having realized her goal?
What next? How am I to deal with this new... condition of hers?

[name="Click"]  What?
[Character(name="char_294_ayer", name2="char_328_cammou",focus=1)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  A Contingency Contract operation agreement. Signed by one Catastrophe Messenger Biederman.

[Character(name="char_294_ayer", name2="char_328_cammou",focus=1)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  No. The Contingency Contract is just a platform.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  It is true that a small percentage of the Messengers using the Contingency Contract have a utilitarian obsession, leading them to “save” as many people as possible.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Wolumonde had already suffered a Catastrophe. Could he have... set the fire to draw in outside forces to intervene...?

[Character(name="char_294_ayer", name2="char_328_cammou",focus=1)]
