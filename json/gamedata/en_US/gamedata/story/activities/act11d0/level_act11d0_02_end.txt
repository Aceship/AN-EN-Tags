[name="Severin"]  —When did they appear?
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  I’m not sure. But the “Gramophone” didn’t start...
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  I told you before not to rely on those experimental automatic Arts devices.
[name="Severin"]  If they have some educated Leithaniens in that Infected group, they could have easily turned a machine against us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Councilor"]  Too late for that. The Infected quarter is crawling with them. They’re whipping them up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  ...The people here should be above that kind of provocation.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  B-but there are more and more protesters every day. They’re gathering up and—
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  What are their demands?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  They want us to start supplying Zwölftontechnik Strasse again... and they want all quarantine measures on Zwölftontechnik Strasse lifted.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  ...Nonsense.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  Of course, their main demand is that we give an appropriate response to the fire...
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  They don’t give a rat’s ass about the fire. Just you wait, everyone will forget what this was about soon enough.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  What should we do? Rhodes Island is already here. It’s only a matter of time before they find out.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  We all know that. Why do you think I sent Tatjana with them?
[name="Severin"]  Before we lay it all out for Rhodes Island, we have to be sure what kind of company they are. We have to know if they’re Atro’s kind of Infected, or “the other” kind.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  I’m not sure that’s right... Won’t things just get worse once they find out on their own what we’re hiding?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  Ha... Think what you will. If they’re the type to turn the other cheek, that’s what they’ll do. You and I both know what’s going on here in Wolumonde.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  I know, but—
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  —Then don’t try to play the good guy here. Things don’t work out for the good guys. We need to focus on outcomes.
[name="Severin"]  *Cough* *cough*... What about the real nasty ones? Like the devils?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  They haven’t made formal contact yet...
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  They’re a bunch of vultures, stirring up our people, looking to divide and conquer. How trite of them.
[name="Severin"]  They’re playing it cool, probing our defenses. When they’re sure there’s no Gendarmerie garrisoned in Wolumonde...
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  Everyone here is ready to fight. And we have the L-44 “Gramophone” defense system.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  But you’re not Gendarmerie... *Sigh*, I’m just trying not to get anyone killed, *cough*— *cough* *cough* *hack*—
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  Take care of yourself. Wolumonde can’t afford to lose you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  Really? I don’t think it makes much difference...
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  Who else could keep Wolumonde’s defenses up without a single Gendarmerie?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  It’s just stubborn blood. Leithanien nobles won’t stoop to doing their own dirty work. Give them one more push and you’ll see this place go to hell in a handbasket.
[name="Severin"]  If we don’t come up with something soon, this game is over.
[name="Severin"]  We have to get back on our normal course before winter. Stay stuck in this wasteland and watch starvation and rioting destroy the town.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5",name2="avg_npc_068",focus=2)]
[name="Townsfolk"]  Maybe... Yes, you’re right.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#3")]
[name="Severin"]  It’s already getting cold, *cough*—
[name="Severin"]  …I hope Wolumonde still has other options.

[Character(name="avg_npc_065")]

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3")]
[name="Folinic"]  ...You’re begging for a fight, Infected.
[name="Folinic"]  Have you been to any other cities? Have you seen how other Infected live?
[name="Folinic"]  Even I can see that Wolumonde is in a crisis, but the non-infected are going through the same tough times as you Infected. Shouldn’t you be working together to get through this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_065")]
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Huh? And who the hell are you?
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_065")]

[name="Suzuran"]  Mhm.
[Character(name="avg_npc_065")]
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Nine-tailed Vulpos are pretty rare. Sooner or later, you’ll end up just like us.

[name="Suzuran"]  I don’t think so... Everyone’s so nice to me...
[Character(name="avg_npc_065")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_065")]
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  What do you mean where is she? The fire took everything from us!
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  They’ve been pushing us out since the Great Rift appeared. They’re terrified!
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  They even rounded up the Infected who came here seeking refuge! Why? Because they have to control us, to lock us up like animals, all to satisfy their twisted idea of humanism!
[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2")]

[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  At least we had Dr. Atro. At least we had each other. Even if we lost this quarter, we at least had a place to stay...

[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Exactly right. You’re making excuses. But... it’s fine.

[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#4", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2")]
[name="Tatjana"]  Thanks.
[name="Tatjana"]  Before the Catastrophe, the Schultz asked Dr. Atro if she would leave with the refugees...
[name="Tatjana"]  Dr. Atro said the same thing—”Rhodes Island won’t abandon you.”
[name="Tatjana"]  Please come with me.
