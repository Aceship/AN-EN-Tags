Mama? Mama, where are you going?
To the highlands? The flowery highlands?
But that’s where the bad man who hurt Papa is? Are you going to punish him?
Will that bring Papa back?
No?
Then... I don’t want you to go.
You have to go? But I don’t want you to go back to Ursus... The bread there is so hard. And winter is so cold.
Mama?
Mama...
......
......
Mama never came back either.
I used the money she left me to continue my studies in Ursus, and to live.
Alone.
I waited alone for years. I lived alone for years.
Until Dr. Kal'tsit appeared before me. She said she was the head of a research institute, and she came to get me.
Dr. Kal'tsit was tired then. Even more tired than she is now. I later learned she had just returned from some faraway place when she found me.
After that, I joined Rhodes Island.
I asked Dr. Kal'tsit where Mama went. She didn’t say much, just that Mama and Papa were together, buried deep inside Ursus.
She is my most respected teacher, my most honored leader. She guided me, educated me, not only with her words, but also through what she and her countless operators did for the Infected.
But the one thing Dr. Kal'tsit never did... was answer my simplest question...
On whom, or what, do I take my revenge?

[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  I’m not sure. That’s the obvious answer, since we have no evidence.
[name="Folinic"]  But with the town as it is, they’re the most likely suspects, aren’t they?
[name="Folinic"]  And “Winterwisp.” Severin wouldn’t say much about it, so I can’t be sure exactly what it means. But since they’re in cahoots with the militia group, they’re at the top of the list too.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#4", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  The mountain range near here is called the Winterwisp Mountains. It’s a barren place, covered with ice and snow year round... could that have to do with anything?

[name="Mudrock"]  So many Leithaniens have joined us, and our ranks have grown bountiful and diverse...

[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Reunion lit the fire that was, is, and will always be burning across all corners of Terra.
[name="GreyThroat"]  But, Reunion does not represent all Infected.
[name="GreyThroat"]  So, what about you? Are you from Leithania yourself? Or are you an exile who wandered here, weighed down by sin and intrigue?
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  Me...? Hm... I guess so. Our aimless journey began in Kazdel. And we’ve been on the run ever since.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Wolumonde is a mess. And I’m sure you had something to do with it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  Right. There’s no way we wouldn’t.
[name="Mudrock"]  But I... am not Reunion either. Not anymore. I’m just the captain of Mudrock Squad. A... mercenary? No, let’s say I’m just an Infected.

[name="Mudrock"]  My condolences, but... We also lost four of ours to the fire.
[name="Mudrock"]  We’re not so good with crime scene investigation or anything like that... But there are a lot of Leithaniens with us.
[name="Mudrock"]  They’ve all been educated, and they have a natural talent for Arts unlike people from other countries.
[name="Mudrock"]  At least... I am sure someone did this. And it was no accident.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Then tell me what you do know. Like, what was that Winterwisp you just mentioned?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  I think you misunderstood. I am not your enemy. I’m only here to pay respects to my people.
[name="Mudrock"]  But maybe someday we will fight each other. I have no reason to... trust you, or share information with you.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  So that’s it then. But it doesn’t matter. I’ve gleaned a lot from your attitude alone.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  By the way, have you been to the town?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Yes.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  What did you think of it?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  It’s a mess. The Infected have risen up in protest, and they’re fighting with the non-infected.
[name="GreyThroat"]  Your people whipped them into a frenzy.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  That’s not good. So many innocent people hurt... But...
[name="Mudrock"]  But until Wolumonde admits its guilt, and until they hand over the murderer, there can’t be peace.
[name="Mudrock"]  How could I convince them to stop, when they’re outraged by the deaths of their people...?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#3", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  It sounds like things have spun out of your ability to control them.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Yes... More and more people keep getting sucked into it. Sooner or later, so will we...
[name="Mudrock"]  We are not in a position to move around so easily, but you are.
[name="Mudrock"]  Oh... I’ve said enough. I still can’t completely trust you, Rhodes Island.

[name="GreyThroat"]  No. The town is so chaotic I was reluctant to even visit the town hall as an official representative of Rhodes Island.
[name="GreyThroat"]  But I found something very concerning. This doesn’t seem to be a typical Infected conflict.
[Character(name="char_294_ayer", name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  True. Leithania has always been rather gentle in its treatment of the Infected. Something very unusual must have happened to push things this far.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  That “Winterwisp” is an important clue. We might have to investigate it further. Ayerscarpe, you come with me. Click, I’d like you to scout out their camp.
[name="GreyThroat"]  We need to get a handle on the size of their team, and their modus operandi. Just a quick look. Carefully.

Mmm——♪ Mmmhmm——♪
Such a brittle little branch~♪
Winterwisp, oh, Winterwisp♪
Weary of a long life, weary of a long death~♪
Sing out your song, firm and strong~♪
Singing through summer~♪
And on through winter~♪
Winterwisp, oh, Winterwisp♪
