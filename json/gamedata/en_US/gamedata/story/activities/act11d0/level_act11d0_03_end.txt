[name="Armed Infected"]  Hand over the murderer. And abandon your prejudices.
[name="Armed Infected"]  ...I want to go home. And I want my job back. Simple enough?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5", name2="avg_npc_067",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  I just need you to fill out a report, and submit to regular physicals. Simple enough.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#5", name2="avg_npc_067",focus=2)]
[name="Armed Infected"]  That’s it?! You walled us in and left us to die!
[name="Armed Infected"]  All that’s left of my block is a heap of earthquake rubble. It’s all Originium clusters that could blow at any moment. You evacuated all the non-infected and we’re running out of supplies. Is anyone coming to help us?
[name="Armed Infected"]  Oh right, I almost forgot. Because you suck at your job, Wolumonde is heading straight to hell, and we’re just the first ones to be thrown under the bus.
[name="Armed Infected"]  You still think you’re so bright, hiding the truth to “maintain order?”

[name="Severin"]  Can’t always make the right choice, no matter how much you might want to. Not unless you’re omniscient.
[name="Severin"]  Objectively speaking, if a prophet or a banker baron told me just a few deaths would bring peace back to Wolumonde...

[name="Tatjana"]  You already knew...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  I was pretty sure. For what it’s worth, I never saw the point in hiding it from them. But keeping it under wraps myself calmed a lot of people down.
[name="Severin"]  What’s your read on them?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=2)]
[name="Tatjana"]  I think they’ll help Wolumonde. They’re the same kind of people as Dr. Atro.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  *Cough* *cough*, *hack*. And you think they speak for all of Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=2)]
[name="Tatjana"]  They’re the ones they sent. So I guess they should be decently representative?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  Truth be told, if every Rhodes Island operator we ran into turned out to be a good person, that would disturb me a lot more.
[name="Severin"]  I’m thinking back... to a certain sniper. She was from Rhodes Island...
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="avg_npc_069#2",focus=2)]
[name="Tatjana"]  The one who came with Dr. Atro and left shortly thereafter?
