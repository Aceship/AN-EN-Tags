Any actual words are swallowed up by bloodcurdling screams.
The smell of charred flesh is among the most chilling odors one can experience.
The man, engulfed in flames, slowly loses his form, leaving behind only a darkened, shadow-like corpse.
He struggles to cry out as his skin sears and his blood boils.
He reaches towards me in unspeakable agony, begging me to save him.
But...
But... Did Thor go through that same pain?
