[name="Ayerscarpe"]  A fire. It’s already been dealt with. And some time has passed. But...
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Here. Rhodes Island supply crates. With dates, serial numbers, everything.
[name="Click"]  There’s an outline in the ash. Looks like there was something rectangular sitting on the box?

[name="GreyThroat"]  Operator Click, Operator Ayerscarpe, our situation has changed.
[Character(name="char_328_cammou")]
[name="Click"]  Y-yeah, I know already!
[name="Click"]  Since you and Ayers rescued me from the mountain, I’m more than glad to help!
[Character(name="char_294_ayer", name2="char_328_cammou",focus=1)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Don’t call me Ayers... *Sigh*. What has Leonhardt been telling you...?
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  The Catastrophe was immensely destructive. Wolumonde will not be in better shape now. What were their Catastrophe Messengers doing?
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Things wouldn’t have gotten so bad if Leonhardt or Earthspirit was there...
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  No point thinking about that now... we should prepare for the worst.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Any objections to setting up camp outside the town?
[Character(name="char_328_cammou")]
[name="Click"]  None whatsoever!
[Character(name="char_294_ayer")]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  I am after all a professional Catastrophe Messenger bodyguard. And this is the “wunderkind” who nearly got herself killed shooting videos deep in the Winterwisp Mountains.

[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Sorry. Please be patient. I have to confirm what happened to Atro.
[name="GreyThroat"]  I’ll be right back.

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3")]
[name="Folinic"]  ...Famine?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  Yes. Famine ruins everyone.
[name="Severin"]  I know what you’re going to say. A town the size of Wolumonde should be self-sufficient.
[name="Severin"]  The day the Great Rift happened, there wasn’t so much Originium breaking through the ground, carving the land up, ruining farms and granaries.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  We’ve been very lucky, in fact. There haven’t been any explosions in the town center or any of the very populated areas. But even so, the losses have been severe...
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  That, on top of an inopportune season. We’re well into autumn and we’re on a course for the Winterwisp Mountains. Winter’s coming early this year.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  We haven’t announced it to the public yet, as to not cause a panic.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  And then we were stabbed in the back by our own people, unwitting as they may be.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Councilor"]  What do we do then... about the traitors?
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  Tatjana took the young people to survey the situation. No one could reach the power plant without a guide.
[name="Severin"]  Each district should have its own auxiliary hauling equipment. What’s the situation?
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Councilor"]  Too slow. At best an eighth the speed of the other towns. We wouldn’t get out of the mountains before winter.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  We can’t let anything happen to the granary. Send more men.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Councilor"]  Men...? Even if we’re talking old folks and children, anyone who’s willing to carry a weapon is already...
[name="Councilor"]  But they wouldn’t go so far as to attack the granary. That’s tantamount to killing every last person in Wolumonde!
[Character(name="avg_npc_068",name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  You give them too much credit.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Um...
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_358_lisa_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  Go ahead.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_358_lisa_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Zwölftontechnik Strasse, the quarantine zone, is it as bleak as it is because...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_358_lisa_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  Would you believe me if I told you we had to cut down on rations entirely because of the Infected population?
[name="Severin"]  No, it doesn’t matter if you believe me or not. Would they believe me?
[name="Severin"]  They would tear down the granary doors and count every last grain before they believed anything that came out of us.
[name="Severin"]  So, do we let them tear it down?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_358_lisa_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Suzuran"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_358_lisa_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  I wouldn’t mind a little open honesty if they really just wanted to take a look. But not everyone’s going to let it end there.
[name="Severin"]  Even without an official announcement, anyone smart enough would be able to figure it out with a calendar and a look at our route that Wolumonde is bound for a terrible winter famine.
[name="Severin"]  They stirred the people up into a frenzy, they looted. They’re just thinking of themselves, making sure they can survive, whether or not it means someone else has to starve. To put it bluntly, they want an excuse to steal.
[name="Severin"]  I believe Rhodes Island has the expertise of dealing with the Infected, like you say. Dr. Atro’s professionalism and your combat skills proved that much.
[name="Severin"]  But...
[name="Severin"]  Is Oripathy the only problem in the world?
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  ......
[name="Folinic"]  Even at a time like this, I have to ask after Atro.
[name="Folinic"]  That was a murder.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=10, ystrength=5, vibrato=20, randomness=30, fadeout=false)]
[name="Councilor"]  Everyone out! The Rhodes Islanders have something important to discuss with the Schultz!
[name="Councilor"]  Severin.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  I know.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  Then, I leave it to you.

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  Should I have added “murder” as “old business” or “new business?”
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  It’s all a consequence of your coverup. No, no need for formalities. I’m disgusted with you.
[name="Folinic"]  Rhodes Island Operator Atro was murdered in the course of her duties here in Wolumonde. And I need answers.
[name="Folinic"]  And, according to a particular Infected resident, they are also hunting this “murderer.”
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  Maybe the killer is one of those Infected. Like when a thief cries out “thief!” Oldest trick in the book.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="Folinic"]  Maybe...
[name="Folinic"]  But before we discuss the murderer, I’d like—
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  Stop. You don’t have to say it.
[name="Severin"]  I do have enough of a conscience left that your request would wound me.
[name="Severin"]  But Wolumonde needs Rhodes Island’s help to get out of this mess. And there’s no point in making things hard for you anymore.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  Come with me.

[name="Folinic"]  ...It’s cold.
[name="Severin"]  I make sure to keep the refrigeration units running.
[name="Folinic"]  Impressive Arts. As to be expected from a Leithanien officer.
[name="Severin"]  Eight victims.
[name="Severin"]  Four from Wolumonde, Dr. Atro, and three Infected outlanders.
[name="Suzuran"]  Including your son... Mr. Thorwald.
