[name="???"]  I can't say for sure, but this is undoubtedly... an opportunity.
[name="???"]  In that case, we'll have this person lead the charge this time...

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  Dr. Kal'tsit, Instructor Dobermann, and I are actually talking about the 'Interlocking Competition.'
[dialog]
[Decision(options="Interlocking... Competition?",values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  That's right. More accurately, that's the 'Interlocking Security Competition.'
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex#3")]
[name="Dobermann"]  The competition originated in ancient Minos. The people of Minos love their competitions and events, and this is what they came up with for the cities to conduct security drills together while learning from one another.
[name="Dobermann"]  In modern times, the competition is more like a 'military exercise,' though there is nothing official about the Interlocking Competitions anymore.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Ever since they restarted the competition, it has become a commercial contest run by unofficial organizations.
[name="Dobermann"]  To ensure the Interlocking Security Competition will be held regularly in different regions and to liaison with the territories' officials, a committee was formed by the private security companies that participate in the competition.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2")]
[name="Amiya"]  And Rhodes Island got an invitation to the next Interlocking Competition. Perhaps one of our collaborators recommended us.
[dialog]
[Decision(options="Let's do it!;What do we get out of the competition?",values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2")]
[name="Amiya"]  The most crucial thing is that the organizers are giving out lots of wonderful prizes and resources!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3")]
[name="Amiya"]  To Rhodes Island, that's also the most important part.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Aside from that, the organizing territory and committee think that the competitions can improve the sway that the region has and create opportunities for collaborations and business, so they're always willing to provide the most advanced and complete training facilities and competition venues.
[name="Dobermann"]  The way that the Interlocking Competition works requires each participating team to know how to both divide its squads and mount concerted assaults properly. If we want a better score and place higher in the rankings, we need to have our tactics and battle plan thought out down to the last detail.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex#3")]
[name="Dobermann"]  If we want to work on our operators' strength as a team, then this competition is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.

[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3", name2="char_003_kalts_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  Hehe, see, Dr. Kal'tsit? I knew the Doctor would say yes.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3", name2="char_003_kalts_1", focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Very well, Dr. {@nickname}, but before you come crying to me, know that you are the one who got yourself into this mess.
[dialog]
[Decision(options="Huh?;......",values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  Actually, Doctor, if we want to place higher in the rankings and get better rewards, we need a highly competent commander.
[name="Amiya"]  If we are to join the competition, then you need to lead the charge.
[dialog]
[Decision(options="You're making me the commander?;......",values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  That's right, Doctor. Your command and judgment are essential to our participation in the Interlocking Competition.

[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  During the Interlocking Security Competition, we will be facing several OpFor squads from whom we'll be taking competition medals and resources.
[name="Dobermann"]  If you want to obtain even more medals within the time limit to exchange for resources and prizes, you'll need to station squads to garrison different Posts.
[name="Dobermann"]  If the judges determine that you have successfully garrisoned the Posts, you will then get to face even stronger foes in the final challenge. Defeating these enemies will earn you even more medals.
[name="Dobermann"]  However, facing these stronger OpFor units will drain even more of your Sanity. If you don't think you can manage, you can also go for your medals via easier means.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex#2")]
[name="Dobermann"]  You'll have to figure out the specifics during the real thing.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  Be sure not to get so focused on your command that you end up making irrecoverable mistakes, though I know you'll come up with the best tactics for the situation, Doctor!
[dialog]
[Decision(options="I'll do my best.",values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Aside from that, to make sure we can adjust to each Interlocking Competition's theme and the OpFor adversaries that may appear, we will be sending a special deputy to accompany you.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3")]
[name="Amiya"]  Don't worry, Doctor! Dr. Kal'tsit, Instructor Dobermann, and I tested and selected this deputy ourselves. I guarantee you they will really distinguish themselves on the battlefield.

[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  It's my mission to train our operators, but I can't keep my eye on them forever. Doctor, it is up to you to command our operators and make sure they work with each other to bring out their best.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Find their weaknesses. Ascertain their objectives. Do not fall into the traps.
