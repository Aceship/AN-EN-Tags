[Interlock.EnsureMapStatus]
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_npc012")] Report. We have successfully garrisoned at the first 'Post.' Our observation shows there has been a change in the atmosphere of the area. We can use this to confirm whether the garrison is successful or not.
[Tutorial(target="pool_btn_interlock_first_final",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc012")] The first 'Special OpFor Unit' has entered the 'Final Proving Ground.'
[Tutorial(target="pool_btn_interlock_first_final", waitForSignal="interlock_stage_final_detail_shown",           animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc012")] Information on the 'Final Proving Ground' has been updated as well.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_npc012")] I see... We've confirmed that the 'Special OpFor Unit' has entered the 'Final Proving Ground.' Now we can challenge the enemy forces in the stage.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Right. One thing I need to point out is that while defeating 'Special OpFor Units' will earn you extra rewards, the amount of Sanity depleted while entering the 'Final Proving Ground' will also go up.
[Tutorial(focusX=-539, focusY=71, focusWidth=157, focusHeight=89, anchor="BottomRight",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] If a 'Special OpFor Unit' makes it to the Objective Point, your Life Points will not be deducted, and the amount of Sanity that was added will also be returned to you after the stage is over. Details in 'Refund Rules.'
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_npc012")] Understood.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] I have no more advice for you. Doctor, whether you choose to begin the challenge right away or garrison at more Posts, I will leave our command during the Interlocking Competition to you.
