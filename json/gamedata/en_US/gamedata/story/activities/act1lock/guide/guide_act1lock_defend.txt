[Interlock.EnsureMapStatus]
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Congratulations, Doctor. I heard from the special deputy that you have completed the first challenge of the 'Final Proving Ground.'
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] I am sure you still remember the rules. If you want your operations to proceed more efficiently, you may clear the newly unlocked 'Post' stages and garrison your units there. This will increase the number of 'Special OpFor Unit' that will appear in the 'Final Proving Ground.'
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] More rewards will be awarded for defeating these enemies.
[Tutorial(target="pool_btn_interlock_first_defend", waitForSignal="interlock_stage_first_defend_detail_shown",            animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] First, select one of the 'Post' stages.
[Tutorial(focusX=746, focusY=190, focusWidth=891, focusHeight=161, anchor="BottomLeft",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")]  You may choose to have your Operators garrison at the 'Post' stage. 'Special OpFor Units' will only appear in the 'Final Proving Ground' when your Post is garrisoned.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Once the 'Post' stage is cleared, you will need to decide whether to 'garrison' the deployed Operators there or not. The corresponding 'Special OpFor Units' will only appear in the 'Final Proving Ground' stage if you choose to garrison your Operators.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_npc012")] Instructor Dobermann, I want to make sure I am getting this right. The Operators who are garrisoned at the Posts will not be allowed to participate in the other 'Post' stages and the 'Final Proving Ground' stage, is that right?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] That's correct. Any Operator who leaves the Post also leaves its Post's defense in an uncertain state. That said, the rules don't require the Posts to be garrisoned. The garrisoned Operators may be recalled at any time if you want to deploy your Operators more effectively.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Our goal is still to reserve our strongest for the 'Final Proving Ground' stage.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] The more Posts we garrison, the more it says our teams are ready to spend more of their energy to face the more perilous challenges in the 'Final Proving Ground', and that's even though we don't know how formidable these extra adversaries will be yet.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_npc012")] Enough talk. We'll know how difficult they will be to overcome once we take them on in battle.
