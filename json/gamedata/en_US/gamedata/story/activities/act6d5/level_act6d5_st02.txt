[name="L.G.D. Officer B"]   No reaction! But looking at the other numbers everything does seem normal...!
[name="L.G.D. Officer A"]   The enemy attacked as soon as our squad approached. They did not respond to any hails. We are unable to establish communication.
[name="L.G.D. Officer B"]   The enemy is scattered! They're weak, resistance is low, but there's lots of them!
[name="L.G.D. Officer A"]   Is this really Reunion?
[name="L.G.D. Officer B"]   The heat source is shifting. Find a way to track it!
[name="L.G.D. Officer A"]   There are no breaches in the city's defenses, they couldn't have gotten in——
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   Don't panic!
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   ......
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   Summon even-numbered formations. Worst case scenario, engage the enemy in the city. Give priority to evacuating civilians.
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   The downtown area is densely populated, especially Temple Street. Have all police officers within that district focus on evacuations.
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   Contact the satellite cities to check if there are any breaches in the defensive lines, confirm the enemy's means of ingress, and hold firm.
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   Reunion should be long gone. We need to identify the enemy. Getting control of the situation is our main task. This is not the first time Lungmen has suffered an abnormal occurrence at New Year's. No need to panic.
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   Stand together. The L.G.D. has nothing to fear.

[name="Nian"]   Ho ho ho——not bad.
[name="Nian"]   I didn't expect to see a massive moving metropolis. You people have some tricks up your sleeves.
[name="Nian"]   And your Arts, well, I've never seen such a skillful and practical approach before.
[name="Nian"]   It's a relief. I was afraid you wouldn't have made much progress.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]   You used the data in those records to create illusions of Reunion and the L.G.D.
[name="Lava"]   Your power is not like Originium Arts, but you can't fool me. Now that I have you figured out, the monsters that have plagued Lungmen for centuries will be no more.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   You're a smart cookie. Where'd you come up with this stuff?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]   I've been combing ancient records and modern papers in a quest to understand you.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   Huh? So all the years I've been sleeping, you've been cramming trivia about me?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]   Pretty much.
[name="Lava"]   I was born and bred to hunt your kind.

[name="Nian"]   I never thought I'd meet someone like you.... before I forgot myself.
[name="Nian"]   Oh, honey, I'm touched. I'm on the verge of tears here. It's like I'm a forgotten has-been meeting an old fan. How about it? Why don't we call a truce and go get a drink?
[name="Nian"]   Since we're waiting for the Tinmen to overpower the... oh, what are they called again...? That's right! Since we're waiting for the Tinmen to beat down the L.G.D., we might as well find something to pass the time.

[name="Nian"]   What are you capable of? You've got taller buildings, a bit more metal in your machines, and your hot pot tastes worse...

[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#4",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#3",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]   You'll see. Let's call it... divination.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#2",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   They're allowing divination these days? Time was, a commoner would be put to death for seeking knowledge of the heavens.

[name="Nian"]   You're right, you know. At first, I wasn't planning to do anything to this city. As far as I was concerned, you were weak little folk, gradually making your way in the world.
[name="Nian"]   But I have to admit, you made some real progress over the years.
[name="Nian"]   And to think someone's actually been watching us all this time. That's a pleasant surprise.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#4",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]   You left behind horror stories and monster myths in every corner of the world. How could we not look for you?
[name="Lava"]   Sometimes it was a giant, sometimes it was an army, sometimes it was Arts like a Catastrophe...
[name="Lava"]   But we always grew stronger, in order to survive.
[name="Lava"]   What I don't understand is how the people of ancient Yen fought with spears and halberds, while Lungmen today has huge cannons to protect the city, and in the end they all suffered the same fate?
[name="Lava"]   Were you going easy back then? Or are you stronger now?
[name="Lava"]   Or——

[name="Nian"]   Sorry, but that's a swing and a miss. How could I figure out something so complicated so quickly?
[name="Nian"]   Turns out, you break stuff down into its simplest parts, language, Arts, anything, and it's all pretty much the same.
