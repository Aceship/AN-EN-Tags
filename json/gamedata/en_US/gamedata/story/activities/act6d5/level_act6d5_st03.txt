Use your spear to strike your shield.
Use your shield to block your spear.
So the question is what happens when your right hand fights your left?
Apparently nothing.
Even if you win, what then?
What then indeed.
Hmmm.... But actually, wouldn't your dominant hand have an advantage?

[name="Amiya"]   Here you are, Officer Ch'en.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   I can look out over the fallen city from here.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   Chief Wei's decision to move the satellite cities and form a defensive line to cut off the Nian's attack was decisive.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   But I never thought that one day I'd be staring down a piece of Lungmen like this.
[name="Ch'en"]   ...It's ridiculous.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   That's where the Nian is.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   There's a mall over there in that district I liked to go to.
[name="Ch'en"]   And some of my friends live there.

[name="Amiya"]   ...I'm sorry, Officer Ch'en
[name="Amiya"]   It's unfathomable that an entire city-state could be at a disadvantage against just one enemy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1")]
[name="Lava"]   With how long it takes to train a professional soldier versus how long it takes her to cast a warrior, it goes without saying.

[name="Amiya"]   Lava! You're here!
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1")]
[name="Lava"]   Sorry, I shouldn't have engaged her like that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Tell that to the operators we lost. The price to extract you was high.
[name="Ch'en"]   What we need is your knowledge and skill. We don't need you killing morale with apologies.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]   Morale? Relying on morale in the face of an unknowable enemy will lead only to death and misery.
[name="Lava"]   To defeat her and take back the city, you must confront the mystery that has plagued us throughout history.
[name="Lava"]   "Her weakness."
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   I thought that was your mission.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]   The good news is that the "Nian" is eager to communicate with us.
[name="Lava"]   The bad news is that her personality is terrible.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   I had high expectations of you, so you better not tell me you're empty-handed.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]   Of course not.
[name="Lava"]   I've managed to glean a few leads from the extensive historiography, but following up on them means more bloodshed.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"]   You don't have to go it alone. The Nian has a nasty temperament. If anything were to happen to you...
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1")]
[name="Lava"]   My blood alone is enough.

[name="L.G.D. Officer"]   But she didn't bring many troops with her....
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1")]
[name="Lava"]   To her, numbers mean nothing. We can only slow her down.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]   You said she has a weakness. Out with it already. We're short on time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1")]
[name="Lava"]   Her weakness is firecrackers.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   ...Firecrackers?
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]   No record of the "Nian" has ever described her face, let alone her weaknesses. But a trip to Yen led me to some new discoveries.
[name="Lava"]   Any culture with a long history will have its legends and folklore. Although some of it may have origins in more recent times, obscuring the truth.
[name="Lava"]   Some theories suggest that firecrackers were the forerunner of modern Originium explosives technology, originating in some devotional folk practices.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"]   That's a pretty common custom. You throw out the firecrackers to scare off the evil spirits and wish for a peaceful new year.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1")]
[name="Lava"]   And what are the evil spirits in these ancient legends?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"]   Oh....
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Wait, the L.G.D. can bring out 100,000 times the explosive power of a firecracker. This doesn't make any sense.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]   "Fear the noise, fear the flame."
[name="Lava"]   If the Nian's function really is "smelting", then a firecracker doesn't pose a threat to her at all.
[name="Lava"]   She... called herself a craftsman. Flame and noise are part of her work, or at least part of some kind of image she projects.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"]   Some kind of image?
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1")]
[name="Lava"]   It's a theory I have to explain her utterly irrational ability to do these things without the use of Originium Arts.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   So she's afraid of herself? You keep making less and less sense...
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1")]
[name="Lava"]   I thought it was just a legend.... But it's worth a try.
[name="Lava"]   She did flinch when I used some big, noisy flame Arts.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   ...It could work. It's not like we have the time to apply rigorous academic peer review anyway.
[name="Ch'en"]   We have to try something, at least. She's already breathing down our necks.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1")]
[name="Lava"]   Let me say one last thing.
[name="Lava"]   She's strong. There may be a way to destroy her, but the price will be high.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   ——The L.G.D. will make sure it isn't *too* high.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]   Try to avoid taking her head on. She doesn't like to kill, at least.
[name="Lava"]   Second, using her power doesn't wear her out. If we get into a war of attrition with her, we're the ones who go down.
[name="Lava"]   Third, for some reason, she has an interest in modern consumer goods.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   ...How does this help us fight her?
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]   The hunter traps the beast by taking advantage of its nature. And what we call "personality" is just nature in a fancy package.
[name="Lava"]   Finally, beware her sword and shield. They are of utterly incomprehensible construction.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Sword and shield, got it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]   I'll be the one striking at her weak point. I hope Amiya and the L.G.D. can create some space for me to do that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   She'll pay for using those Reunion illusions to toy with our Lungmen.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"]   But command of the L.G.D....
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Chief Wei and the Doctor have it under control.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   Then I'll go with you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]   Amiya...
[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   It's okay, I can take care of myself.
[name="Amiya"]   With Rhodes Island and the L.G.D. fighting the good fight, it's time for me to do what I can...
[name="Amiya"]   And that's slowing the Nian's advance. No problem!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_383_snsant_1#1",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_383_snsant_1#1",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=1)]
[name="Snowsant"]   Th- then I'll go submit the application...
[Character(name="char_2006_weiywfmzuki_1")]
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   That will take too long. I will add a supplementary report later.
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   We can't let these regulations slow us down when we're fighting for our lives.

[name="Lava"]   Thanks.
[Character(name="char_383_snsant_1#1")]
[name="Snowsant"]   B- but it takes time to sort out the documents from each department and print them out...
[name="Snowsant"]   Ah, I know!
[name="Snowsant"]   I can draw a simple diagram for you.
[Character(name="char_383_snsant_1#1",name2="avg_npc_044_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]   What?
[Character(name="char_383_snsant_1#1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_044_1",name2="char_2006_weiywfmzuki_1",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   It's very complicated, of course. The power supply to the surface plane alone, not to mention the Originium engine is a tremendous undertaking.
[name="Wei Fumizuki"]   But if Snowsant thinks she can draw it, perhaps she can.
[Character(name="char_383_snsant_1#1")]
[name="Snowsant"]   I wanted to study up for my new job, so I went ahead and memorized every blueprint I could find!

[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   Yeah, but how did you know she was at Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   Huh?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   I can tell the surveillance system was pretty brutally hacked.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#3",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   Ha, ha, ha, me? I'm not gonna tinker with that stuff just because I'm curious about new technology! Definitely not! Not this Nian!
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#3",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   Hey! That was hard to fix! There's better ways for you to pull records!
[name="Closure"]   If you were a good girl who worked hard, you could've gotten some Yen food in the cafeteria.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#4",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   I am working hard! I'll lend you "Lungmen Doomwatch" for a little historical research, and the real issue with it is...
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#4",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   ...Is what?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   Doesn't the title kinda suck? What's a "Doomwatch?"
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   I noticed the operators have been registering their equipment with more Laterano-ey names lately. Turns out that's your fault?
[name="Closure"]   How about "Ancient Forge"!
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   Do you think you could get these guys to come work with us on our movie? That's all I really care about.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   No way, the actors you guys picked are too much.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   Put a little more effort into it! It's a Rhodes Island New Year's movie!
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   Throw those guys in there and there's no room for effort! Get real!
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   Pfft. Fine! As a true cinephile, I will express my motivations to the audience through the medium of film! I'm sure I'll get through!
[name="Nian"]   Oh, do you think I should add "based on true events"? Is that too scary? Would it freak out li'l Lava?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   Don't worry about it. Lava's not a kid anymore. We can all see how much she's grown.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   ...A kid? You're about the same age, aren't you? Sarkaz don't show their age so well, but you can't fool me.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   Ahem! She's the backbone of Rhodes Island! An operator anyone can rely on!
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   Yeah, right.
[name="Nian"]   It's just like she always dreamed. She's doing some badass stuff, becoming a badass warrior.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   How about that?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   So what's to worry about? Where's the harm in a little more knowledge?
[name="Nian"]   I'm not here to play mystic like some people. Just come out and say whatever you gotta say.
[name="Nian"]   Besides, they'll find out sooner or later. I've got a plan.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   ...Ugh.
[name="Closure"]   They'll find out sooner or later... hey! You've got a point there!
[name="Closure"]   But why start with Lava?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   I really like my li'l Lava.
[name="Nian"]   Her hard work, her attitude, her progress, Rhodes Island always surprises me like that.
[name="Nian"]   You got the scrappy little one making big strides. That's more fun than the operators who are already too strong for their own good, right?
[name="Nian"]   So I'm willing to stay here and sell Rhodes Island to my brothers and sisters who aren't so hostile to humans.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   ...How do you sell it? The best mobile ship on Terra for mingling?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   That's right! Rhodes Island's infinite inclusiveness is the key to settling any clash of tastes!
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   Hey.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#4",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   Not to mention, it's one of the few places out there you can still have a little fun.
[name="Nian"]   We can get along, we can fight, and we can watch the sunset together after a hangover.
[name="Nian"]   Every tomorrow is pretty precarious for me. You know.
[name="Nian"]   So I really kinda like Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#4",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"]   Oh... well... hm...
[name="Closure"]   Am I supposed to blush and accept the compliment? Or should I just tease you for being super sappy?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#3",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Nian"]   Happy New Year! What's for dinner?

[name="Lava"]   Give me a little time. Thanks to a certain hammy lead actress, we might not be able to make it.
[Character]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]   Huh? What did she do...?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#3")]
[name="Lava"]   Ugh.... Have you seen this new script....?
[Character]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]   ...So what do we do?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1")]
[name="Lava"]   Whatever. Just improvise.

[name="Lava"]   Not changing up this stupid death scene at all, huh.
[name="Lava"]   Heh, what a lousy villain.
