[name="Saria"]...That's the sound of an aircraft.
[name="Saria"]Ferdinand, where is that one from?
[name="Ferdinand"]The 'Horizon Arc Project' isn't just that superweapon Kristen's floating through the air. It's a complete strategic program.
[name="Ferdinand"]I tapped into some connections to borrow an aircraft they use to service 'Arc-01,' and blew up the rest while I was at it.
[name="Ferdinand"]Let me be clear. Look across all of Columbia, and you'll find very few passenger aircraft safely able to fly near barrier altitude.
[name="Ferdinand"]They won't need much time to scramble high-altitude craft from the District, but for you, and for me, that time is more than enough.
[name="Saria"]You're proposing a collaboration.
[name="Saria"]You believeâ€”that you're seriously qualified for this?
[name="Ferdinand"]There's the same old Saria I know.
[name="Ferdinand"]As though you'd have the ability to quell every single problem, even if I wasn't there to help.
[name="Ferdinand"]But I don't have a single shred of doubt about this.
[name="Ferdinand"]In your own words, there is no reason we should clash.
[name="Ferdinand"]H.A.M.H.R.R. has reached the S.H.A.F.T.'s aerial space, and the S.H.A.F.T. has begun accumulating energy.
[name="Ferdinand"]If we let this situation unfold as is, then no matter what Kristen's up to, this <i>will</i> end with the Department of Defense exposed to the winds of scrutiny.
[name="Ferdinand"]And I'm sure we all know how Rhine Lab, as an 'accessory' to it, will end up.
[name="Saria"]And whether it be as a clandestine military proxy, or a former Director of Rhine Lab, you'll be finished, Ferdinand.
[name="Ferdinand"]Exactly.
[name="Ferdinand"]But I'm not about to give in.
[name="Ferdinand"]We can still make it in time.
[name="Ferdinand"]We can bring H.A.M.H.R.R. back down again in a safe descent before the energy excitation, and then there will be room to pull everything back.
[name="Saria"]And is it your life you're looking to redeem, or Rhine Lab?

[name="Ferdinand"]Here I'd thought the busywork at Defense had ground away all your researcher's insight.
[name="Ferdinand"]Still, I've been ready for less time than you think.
[name="Saria"]Do you honestly believe this adventure of yours will rescue anything?

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_890_1#6$1", focus="r")]

[name="Kal'tsit"]With regards to the Rhine Lab commotion and Kristen going out of control, the military and the Maylander Foundation are like weights once again placed on the scales, trying to preserve the semblance of a civilized nation.
[name="Kal'tsit"]But none of that is what matters most, what should concern most.
[name="Kal'tsit"]From the very beginning, Kristen has been brushing against something far beyond anyone's imaginations, and with that as a focus, has launched a charge against the sky.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I worry her actions will bring unexpected things to bear upon Terra. My intent was to stop her before then... but we were one step too slow.
[name="Kal'tsit"]On Terra today, interfering in such things is no longer easy. Civilization is much more expansive than I thought.

[name="Kal'tsit"]You may suggest those aboard Rhodes Island today, Amiya, Closure, the hunters with ties to Ã†gir... They know a great deal already, which has helped to resolve their own issues.
[name="Kal'tsit"]But when you plough the fields, you never pay mind to why the horizons form as clouds, rain and lightning, yet perhaps you may want to know when the next storm will come.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The arrogant acts of noble politicians versus repeated Catastrophe, the forecasted yield of crops versus new tax levies, these are things that ground life. The reality is, countless have no regard for even that much.
[name="Kal'tsit"]They simply do not care for the fates of others.
[name="Kal'tsit"]From a Terran's point of view, even if they did choose to believe such far-flung knowledge and information, what could they do about it? What use would it be?
[name="Kal'tsit"]The wise that take note of all around them, those bare few, are the only ones able to maintain their thought.
[name="Kal'tsit"]And the rest, when faced with things that outstrip their comprehension, more than often opt to laugh it off or persecute it, so as to protect their comfortable bubbles of ignorance from any outside challenge.

[name="Kal'tsit"]'Breakthrough.' A neutral descriptor, but you still unconsciously believe that the 'sky' is something that should have no limit.
[name="Kal'tsit"]To any scholar across the land, all that happens high in the sky is unsolved natural phenomena, just as Catastrophe and the ocean are.
[name="Kal'tsit"]They will puzzle, probe at its inner workings, use their knowledge and philosophies to dissect it allâ€”they will research all the phenomena of the sky, never considering that 'the sky should not be this way.'
[name="Kal'tsit"]Countless children have flown for it in their dreams, and they too quickly realize, the sky is not something that can be freely soared through.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Drones and vehicle altitudes have been rigorously restricted, and the spreading of every fowlbeast's wings is constrained by instinct.
[name="Kal'tsit"]This is the state of common sense upon this land. No one has ever questioned the rising of the sun and setting of the moon, and no one has ever questioned how it is all that all beings come to grow.

You follow Kal'tsit's gaze far, to where a dangerous silver glint perches atop the rock.
A woman clings to the stalactite wall with nothing but her tail, almost like she's floating in the air, taking in the two of you with great amusement.
You feel uneasy.
It isn't Ho'olheyak's sudden appearance before you, rather that you realize how Kal'tsit, of prudence comparable to an automated machine, has made a mistake so rudimentary, even to you.
Ho'olheyak gently lands beside the two of you. Her mirthful smile draws scratches across your beating heart.
