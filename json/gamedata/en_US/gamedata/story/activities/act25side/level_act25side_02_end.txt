[name="Tin Man"]Right, the Maylander Foundation is already allocating our resources to ensure Vice President Jackson's safety, but that alone will not stop the military's plan.
[name="Tin Man"]One of the events after the press conference includes a visit to Rhine Lab. His entire trip that day will be broadcast live.
[name="Tin Man"]If his assassins and our agents come to blows before the public, it doesn't matter if the assassination itself is successful or not. Blake will still have a reason to declare martial law and take over Trimounts.
[name="Tin Man"]Just like District 13 right now.
[name="Tin Man"]Neither I nor Maylander likes it when the enemy has all their eggs in one basket.
[name="Tin Man"]Because that's always an omen of the collapse to come.

Stop her own mentor? Find Control and beg for the truth from her?
He was right. How could she stop anyone if she doesn't even know where to begin?

Haydn 1 Laboratory, Site 359, Triton Factory...
Parvis, Dorothy, Jara, Muelsyse...
