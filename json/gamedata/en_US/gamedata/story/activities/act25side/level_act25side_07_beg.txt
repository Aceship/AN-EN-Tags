[name="Justin Jr."]Bam. The nightmare that plagued my family was gone. Like it never even existed.
[name="Justin Jr."]Only later did I learn that the key element in the drug popped up when an intern researcher happened to mess up some reagents.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_892_1#9$1", focus="l")]

What the hell is that mad scientist thinking?
Idealism. Obsession. Curiosity. Initiative.
It's a trend that scientists are tied to these qualities.
Silence will admit, as a scientist herself, as a former Rhine Lab employee, that when she first caught that tremendous megastructure rising to the sky, she felt a faint tug on her heartstrings.
And a mortifying sense of pride.
This company she once struggled for was creating—no—had created a wonder of the land... of the sky. She should by all rights bask in it... shouldn't she?
Deception. Calculation. Sacrifice. Conspiracy.
She quickly comes to, realizing what this marvel was built upon.

Kristen, and those like her, and those who wear the same guise as her...
They all lay claim to their vision, their direction, as the way that science's progress should orient.
She wouldn't dare say she understands the secretive, elusive Control, but she understands the rest of them, and the respective... costs of their journeys forward.
Who will define progress? Who will watch over it... Hasn't it seen too many sacrifices beneath its heels?
