[name="Tin Man"]These past few years, the Armed Forces, or more accurately, the Department of Defense, has continued to explore the nation's military capabilities.
[name="Tin Man"]As a whole, progress has been fairly steady. From the President's perspective, this is a good thing, and he is glad to see it happen.
[name="Tin Man"]However, given the shifts in international dynamics in recent years, particularly the re-emergence of Victoria's Shard, a number of things have changed.
[name="Tin Man"]Such a terrifying superweapon has erased the concept of 'distance.' All our ground defenses will be rendered useless, and the dust brought about by the Storm may well fall upon our pillows at any time.
[name="Tin Man"]The voices within the Department of Defense have grown increasingly hawkish, and a number of troubling signs have already appeared. They're hedging their bets on the research and development of similar era-defining strategic weapons.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_896_1#3$1")]
[name="Saria"]And that's how Kristen caught the military's eye?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_900_1#1$1")]
[name="Tin Man"]Correct. Kristen became the military's core technical advisor.
[name="Tin Man"]In a very short period of time, she submitted the proposal for the 'Horizon Arc Project,' planned the construction of the Arc-01 superweapon, and quickly began its implementation.
[name="Tin Man"]The military has devoted a vast amount of resources to it, and as such, Rhine Lab has enjoyed greater policy-side support for quite some time now.
[name="Tin Man"]This is why Rhine has been able to stand head and shoulders above many other tech companies in Trimounts.
[name="Tin Man"]According to the information we have on hand, the construction of Arc-01 required digging complex S.H.A.F.T.s as well as erecting a H.A.M.H.R.R. at our aircrafts' altitude limit.
[name="Tin Man"]A monumental project indeed, and the military has spared no expense in the effort.
[name="Tin Man"]I imagine the man in front of you who fell from the sky was a part of this project.

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_899_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Blake"]It's simple. All they need to do is delay. If we say that efficiency is the pursuit of scientific research, then, Ferdinand, 'delay' is the preferred tool of these politicians.

Ho'olheyak scans the space in front of her, a massive, hollow underground ring-shaped structure. In other words, a 'well.'
Originium lamps fastened to the well's walls provided only a basic lighting, making it difficult to determine the overall depth. Inlaid within the grooves running along the walls are cables extending into the darkness.
The person with who she was speaking earlier is now pacing back and forth, leaving her with but a busy silhouette.
She seems to be busy testing something. Even in such a deep area, her actions do not seem to cause much of an echo. Presumably, the surface structure incorporates some high-performance sound-absorbing material.
The entire area seems to be as still and silent as lingering mist.

Nasti dives back into her own work, and the screen is once again engulfed with a large amount of data, like a tide flooding across land.
She focuses up more, leaving Ho'olheyak alone to do little else than stare at her back. That is when she notices the devices around her waist–
They appear as a lattice of dead branches, spliced together irregularly. But as Nasti intermittently works at her station, they sway back and forth in a short, regular rhythm.
As if sentient, they seem to be following Nasti's thoughts.
