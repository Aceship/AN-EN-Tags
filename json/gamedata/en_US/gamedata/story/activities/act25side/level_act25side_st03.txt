A coastal view that one can see anywhere in Iberia.
Rubble close by indicates the place may have once been a prosperous village, but now, only a solitary wind chime left hanging on a wall echoes the waves as they hit the shore.

A wave washes a Sea Terror onto the beach.
No, perhaps it might have followed the wave to dry land.
Whatever it was, it didn't seem to have a goal in mind. It merely wanders, looks around, just like its brethren do.
It shouldn't have found anything. All it can see while standing in this overgrowth is the endless ocean and the sky.
But in the next moment, as if it has sensed something, and looks towards a certain direction.
The never-changing sky is swept by a wave of ripples.

She is falling at high speed.
The wind howls, scraping against her face like a knife, and the cold, thin air rushes into her nasal cavities, making breathing difficult.
Raw calcium accumulates in a frenzy, forming a thick crystalline layer around her body, so as to prevent her dying from the violent air friction. But she cannot do anything about the impact when she lands...
It was already over.

In the blink of an eye, she finds herself in the wilderness.
A hallucination? Arts? What kind of Originium Arts is this? This is how that crazy God has given her His answer?
Ho'olheyak looks around in all directions, and does not find anything matching what she had in mind.
She only sees a pair of father and daughter playing by the water, and the girl sporting long and familiar locks of pale gold.
A girl who looks a lot like Kristen.
Ho'olheyak waits patiently. She expects this boring and realistic scene to change, but nothing happens.

It's quiet.
In the aftermath of those unfathomable energy waves tearing through the skies, the facility that should be full of scientists, soldiers and workers is now completely empty.
You and Kal'tsit travel between these structures without exchanging a single word.
There's so much information to go through... and so much history.
Perhaps only after seeing the smiles of Ifrit and Rosmontis, and hearing some firm words from Saria again will you only feel at ease.
But a discomforting feeling lingers in your mind.
Light flashes across the edges of your peripheral vision.
