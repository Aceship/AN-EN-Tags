She sat on a tree stump, humming as she observed the shapes of the clouds above. It was not until her mother called for her that she hopped off and ran toward the voice.

Then, her body felt very light. A nauseous feeling gushed through her larynx, and her heart raced to the tip of her throat. She squeezed tightly into her mother's embrace.
[SoundVolume(volume=0.2, fadetime=1.5,channel="wind")]
Fortunately, the feeling didn't last very long. When the aircraft stopped jolting, she slowly relaxed.
But she was still afraid to open her eyes...
Until her mother lightly tapped her shoulder.
She finally found the courage to open her eyes and look around.
From this angle, the city where she had lived her whole life felt so foreign and strange. The crowds that she was struggled to squeeze through now looked like tiny, insignificant insects.
Her mother pointed up, prompting her to look.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_892_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_892_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Justin Jr."]You also know what you want. For instance, you've been planning to propose to a certain someone, which got delayed by this trip, right? Oh~ I wonder how that proposal would go on the Minoan plains?

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_134",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_892_1#3$1",focus="r")]
[name="Justin Jr."]But you'll be held accountable? Haha, we came prepared.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_892_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Justin Jr."]I mean it. The old men behind you have a serious appetite. I spent twice my budget to get all this in order... They've been plenty arrogant the last couple years, and that won't do.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_892_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Justin Jr."]Those greedy, selfish idiots haven't been willing to face facts. What, do they think they're some kind of Ursus or Leithanian nobles? Haha.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_892_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Justin Jr."]I prefer practical men like you, and so does Rhine Lab.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_892_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Justin Jr."]So, you could make a considerable fortune out of all this. Then, you and I can send those stubborn old men to prison. They won't get a chance to turn things around for the rest of their miserable lives.

[name="Jackson"]Dear Columbians of Trimounts. This is your Vice President, Conrad Jackson.
[name="Jackson"]I'm sure many of us are confused by today's press conference. Before I explain anything, I'd like to have a chat with you all.
[name="Jackson"]Do any of you feel that, on our Terra today, it's gotten hard to focus just on the cities or even the country in which we reside...?
[name="Jackson"]There is more and more to be proven, exchanges between nations have become more frequent, and likewise conflicts and confrontations have become more intense and unavoidable.
[name="Jackson"]So I want to ask all of you. Columbia has only be around for a handful of decades, but our history is already as rich as any other nation's. What is it that we have used to achieve this?
[name="Jackson"]It's our thirst for knowledge that drives us to explore the boundaries and depths of science. It's the pioneering spirit that flows in the veins of every single Columbian. That's my answer. That's our answer.
[name="Jackson"]And to 'maintain' these two things, we are always willing to pay the price, no matter how high it may be.

The Tin Man lifts his head up to gaze at the bottom of the dark clouds. Not far away, a pure white Feline and a fire-red Savra sit on a bench.
The Savra girl enthusiastically tries to tell something to her buddy, but her buddy simply stares at the sky, seemingly paying no attention whatsoever.
She is thinking about the past.
She seems to know why she received that letter and why she had to come back to this country, but she actually doesn't understand it all that well.
She is simply thinking that there are things you have to face, sooner or later.

Kal'tsit silently looks at Trimounts shrouded in dark clouds in the distance.
Its tall skyscrapers remain under the thick, dark clouds; its base hidden by the fields around them.
Likewise, the Tin Man lifts his head.
Up in the sky above the city and the entire lands, at an unreachable altitude that mankind has dreamt of reaching for thousands of years—
—A burning fireball is tearing through the skies like a falling star.

Will a star come falling down? There's no time to think. Time is flying by.
