[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_893_1#1$1")]
[name="Jara"]She threw three dozen listening devices onto my desk, and right in my face, shattered them to pieces with her newly developed Arts.
[name="Jara"]An unfortunate thing, as a couple of them were operating on behalf of some of our dear government departments.
[name="Jara"]They were just a little wary of such a rapidly-progressing tech company.
[name="Jara"]I was happy to share some 'controllable' information with them, to get them to ease up a little.
