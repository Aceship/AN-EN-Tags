Once upon the land, there was no meaning in looking up.
There was nothing worth looking at up there, nothing worth exploring. That place was the domain of those who indulged in fantasies, those with their heads in the clouds.
But now, each and every person lifts their heads, looking up at the beam of light connecting heaven and earth.
Looking up at the once untouchable sky.

[name="Parvis"]They have been dubbed, the 'revenants.' The pronunciation can be a bit esoteric, but I'm sure you'll be able to find some records in Victorian.
[name="Parvis"]Silence, have you ever considered what chimerism does at the level of the soul?

[name="Parvis"]This is something I've been working on for decades, to little avail. That is, until Ferdinand told me that he and Dorothy had jointly produced this particular 'Transmitter.'
[name="Parvis"]You can't begin to imagine how excited I was, Silence!
[name="Parvis"]I was absolutely sure that the properties of the 'Transmitter'... were sufficient to form the soil from which artificial consciousness could be born.
[name="Parvis"]However, in this land, disturbances will always exist no matter how sophisticated the lab is. These disturbances have plagued me for the longest time...
[name="Parvis"]There are so many possibilities. Perhaps the energy used to excite the Transmitter was insufficient, perhaps the laboratory was not sealed off enough, perhaps Originium interferes with the generation and aggregation of consciousness.
[name="Parvis"]But, none of that matters anymore. All mysteries will finally be unraveled today.
[name="Parvis"]This will be my final research project.

[name="Parvis"]Mediocrity, boredom, risk-aversion, indecisiveness... Silence, those of us with the knowledge and ability have to do more than just 'explore' or 'progress.'

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#1$1",focus="l")]

[name="Parvis"]What, are you going to regurgitate that old platitude about science belonging to the masses?
[name="Parvis"]No!
[name="Parvis"]Let me tell you, Silence, that science belongs to the Übermenschen. The supermen.

[name="Parvis"]But only science is above their meddling.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#1$1",focus="l")]
