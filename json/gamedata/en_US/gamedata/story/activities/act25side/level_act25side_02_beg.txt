These stars have twinkled above Terra since ancient times.
Just how many romantic myths and searching gazes do they hold?
Astrologers spend their lives assigning symbols to constellations and celestial bodies to give them meaning, while shamans and druids try to interpret the trails left by every passing meteor.
They are untouchable. Indeed, it is precisely because of this that the sky has become the true home of those who indulge in fantasy.
And for this great land, looking up holds no meaning.

Kal'tsit looks out the window.
The skyscraper in the distance with its gigantic glass facade frames a billow of clouds, its surface crystal clear, like a leaf full of dewdrops.
Indeed, it is just a leaf.
Her gaze expands, and the building quickly disappears into a nest of countless skyscrapers: exhibitions on science and technology interspersed with expo halls, and other specialized buildings scattered around at random, like a bacterial colony in a forest.

[name="Kal'tsit"]Once you start such a huge project, it should drain Trimounts's energy in an extremely short span of time, like stuffing a giant sponge into a glass of water.
