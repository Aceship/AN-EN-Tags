Silence lowers her head to examine Ifrit, just like she used to do, with the same meticulous and gentle manner as ever, but Ifrit still feels very nervous.
She has never been scared of Silence getting angry at her.
One of the first things she learned growing up was that Silence's anger stemmed from a concern for her.
She knows that after Silence is angry, she helps her take care of the things that were doing her harm, and helps her chase off the things that were scaring her.
It was not real anger.
But Ifrit is scared of this silent Silence.
When Silence does not show an ounce of anger, and rather, is quieter than usual, she realizes—
Something must have hit Silence's limit.

[name="Muelsyse"]I'm not sure about the specifics, but that's Saria, you know? Harder than diamonds! She wouldn't be in any serious danger, right?
[name="Muelsyse"]The big question is what you do next. You must've gotten the feeling that once the military gives you a warning, they don't give up so easily.
