Something rolls out from the murky shadows.
Perhaps it's due to its material hardness, but as it rubs against the ground, it eerily resembles a cog out of its wheel, a frightful rattle echoing through the darkness of the night.
It rolls straight to the alley entrance, where light and darkness meet.
It turns out to be a metal head.
The upper half is usually obscured by a hat's brim, and the mouth on its lower half often has a cigarette exhaling rings of smoke while spouting words that are at times perceptive, and other times incongruous.
But now there is no cigarette, no hat, no trench coat, or even the part that should be present past the neck.
There is only a head.
