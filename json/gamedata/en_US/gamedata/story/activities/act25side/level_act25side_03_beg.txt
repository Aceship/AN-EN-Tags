Another sunny day.
The urban planning of Trimounts is intricate, the gaps between the staggered skyscrapers allowing sunlight to pass through, for the sun to paint each street with warm light evenly in these early days of winter.
You look up to see a dark cloud in the distance, floating nonchalantly in the sky. The wind is blowing toward the cloud, and it looks to be moving away from the city.
But it never disappears.
You also see the busy streets, the parked cars, a flash of light up high in the distance, and well-disguised 'passersby'...
