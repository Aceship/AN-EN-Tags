[name="Jara"]This car has been modified by the Engineering Section. It may not look much, but you can trust it.
[name="Jara"]I hope you brought your driver's license, Mr. Pavard. We'll take a special passage on the east side. We've planned a new route for you.
[name="Jara"]The rest of your retinue will return in small groups once the dust has settled.

[name="Jara"]No, we wouldn't have allowed an explosion of this size to occur if we knew about it in advance.
[name="Jara"]But Rhine Lab and the Maylander Foundation's work isn't done until you're back safely at your residence... the enemy has more than one plan, and we have more than one contingency.

[name="Jara"]Once again, I wish you a pleasant stay in Trimounts.
