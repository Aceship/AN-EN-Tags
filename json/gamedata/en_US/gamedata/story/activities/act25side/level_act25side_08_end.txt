[name="Jara"]Why?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#1$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]Because—whatever this experiment is, if Control freely conducts it, and succeeds in it—
[name="Silence"]And this being the Control of Rhine Lab, we all know, whether out of emotional confidence or rational judgment, that she is very likely to succeed—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#5$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]—What do you think the researchers of Columbia are going to see in her?

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#8$1", focus="l")]

[name="Jara"]Kristen would become a hero and an idol throughout all of Columbian science.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#1$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]Yes. She'll become the scientist's paragon, the benchmark of a researcher.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#5$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]And then, the floodgates will be open forever.

[name="Silence"]And the others? The ones bragging about themselves as geniuses and leaders? The ones inspired by this 'pioneer spirit by any means necessary?'

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#5$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]Then that—is a future I am sure you can imagine the shape of.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#4$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]Perhaps we don't even need to imagine...
[name="Silence"]With the research you yourself conducted on Rhine Lab, you've never been in the dark.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]I know very well, Silence.
[name="Jara"]I know very well how much of that kind of thing has happened, and is happening inside Trimounts—no, within the borders of Columbia.
[name="Jara"]There have been plenty of insane and alluring projects placed before me, their owners starry-eyed, their smiles sincere.
[name="Jara"]They wholeheartedly believe they serve 'pure science.' They're the Pioneers of the wilds that we know.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#5$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]While all you and your colleagues have to do is evaluate whether inside their experimental plans, their grand blueprints, there lies even the off-chance it might incur the slightest 'cost' or 'waste.'
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]'Cost.'
[name="Jara"]Sometimes it comes in the form of a fertile field, and sometimes it's some number of terminal patients or death row inmates. Sometimes it's a village or a town, and sometimes it's some specific race or even nation.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]And as I see it, sometimes, it's their own selves too.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#5$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]Are you scared of that, Director Jara? Or do the possibilities for science's forward progress excite even you to no end?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#10$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]Director Jara, never upon this earth has there existed a specimen of 'pure science' in a glass bell.
[name="Silence"]Science lies in our hands, in the people's hands. You have to know its temperature, its weight, whether it burns people, whether it will bring suffering or if it will console.
[name="Silence"]Those people forever claim that they're the way forward, but all they do is set foot with wild abandon in whichever direction they wish to.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#8$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]But, Silence, that is what progress is.
[name="Jara"]Nobody knows where the path lies. This is the walk they must take.
[name="Jara"]The fortunate will find the right place, and enter the light. The misfortunate will run into dead ends, and spin in circles.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]But there is no way you can make them stop.
[name="Jara"]You're a researcher yourself. You know what's most unstoppable of all.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#5$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]......
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]—It is craving.
[name="Jara"]Matter can't bind it, morality can't bind it, and rules can't bind it all the same.
[name="Jara"]Across this land, all throughout history, before Kristen, there were those greedy, egotistical, overreaching, stubborn people you speak of, and when did they ever stop?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#5$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]And so, from now on, they must stop.
[name="Silence"]At the very least, they must stop, before stooping to see just what sits beneath their feet.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#2$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]Director Jara, I feel—scientist's fuel should not derive from cravings and ideals, nor should it come from calculations and choices.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#1$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]Science is a clear, incisive look at every one of us.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]......
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#1$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]But I'm afraid not one researcher is willing to see that quote on the walls of their lab.
[name="Jara"]It is lip service.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#5$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]And so, I will make it practice, Director Jara.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#1$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]I don't want to give up midway, and I still have your blessing.

[name="Jara"]......
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]Silence, Kristen has spent a very long time readying this plan. I don't know how much she's poured into it.

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#11$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]Fine... this isn't you, it's me.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#1$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]In which case, Director Jara, what is it exactly that you hope for? To see Kristen succeed, or to bring her back safe and sound?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]......
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#1$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]I know a researcher who goes by Ruby. Her greatest wish is to clock out on time and retire without hassle.
[name="Silence"]I just ran across a soldier. I imagine his only wish right now is to get out of this out-of-control S.H.A.F.T. without incident, and then flee the clutches of Trimounts and its scientific loons together with his family.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#1$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]Is Control's wish any more lofty, compared to theirs?
[name="Silence"]Because the thing she wants—makes sufficient 'progress?'
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#2$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]Or is this simply because the feelings between you, and her—are sufficiently close?
[name="Silence"]Director Jara, you know this isn't fair.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#1$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]You can't be this selfish.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]I...
[name="Jara"]......
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#9$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#7$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]We must concede what emotions weigh. Kristen has this dream. I can't just stand here and fold my arms.
[name="Jara"]Silence, you would understand this, wouldn't you?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1031_slent2_1#10$2", focus="m")]
[name="Silence"]But if we can stop Control, she could very well still—
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]She won't.
[name="Jara"]She won't, child.
[name="Jara"]I know full well... when she set this project into motion, she never planned to return.
[name="Jara"]Since long ago—even, since we first met, there has been no... taking back any of this.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]Silence, it makes me very happy that you could stand in my way here. I can even say that I support your viewpoint.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_893_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Jara"]But, as Kristen's...
[name="Jara"]......

[name="Jara"]Go on and show me. Are you really... prepared to bear every word you've said?
[name="Jara"]What you face from hereon is more than a single Parvis, or a lone Kristen.
[name="Jara"]What you face—is every person that attempts to forge forward.

A heatwave washes with a burn past Jara's face. The Liberi researcher she'd never paid particular mind to before now continues straight inward, running deeper into the S.H.A.F.T.'s layers.
Jara is suddenly struck by a feeling that there is nothing, not one thing, that could get in that silhouette's way.
Perhaps, she really can make good on what she promised herself.
She imagines, come that time, that maybe she can be of a little help.

[name="Nasti"]It's a success. H.A.M.H.R.R.'s materials and structure have withstood the shock from the energy beam for the time being.
[name="Nasti"]Next comes the charging and focus phase. As long as we can collect the readings from such high-pressure conditions...
[name="Justin Jr."]I'm afraid at this point, the army and Maylander guys grab their last chance to stop it from fully focusing.
[name="Justin Jr."]Aren't you worried about Control?
[name="Nasti"]Like she ever needed us to worry.
[name="Nasti"]We're going the same way. And that's all we are.
