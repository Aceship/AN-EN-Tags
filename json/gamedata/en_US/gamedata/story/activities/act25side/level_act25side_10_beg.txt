Compared to the previous area filled with instruments and equipment, this place feels more like a temple to the stars.
A sphere made of smooth and flawless metal shows off its dazzling beauty under the soft light.
Spheres of varying sizes slowly glide on predetermined orbits one after another, with their paths changing now and then.
The irregularities intertwine with each other, but contrary to expectations, they form an indescribable sense of harmony.
Whether it be the positions of the stars, or how precise their orbits shift, the planetarium exceeds the imaginations of any astrologer.
But in the very next moment, those devoted to the stars would probably fly into a rage.

[name="Kristen"]Those so-called astrologers are basically misguided zealots.
[name="Kristen"]For the past thousand years, they've committed themselves to tracking the trajectory of the stars.
[name="Kristen"]Every trajectory change that occurs signifies a new revelation, or a meaningful omen to them.
[name="Kristen"]Their behavior is not necessarily incomprehensible.
[name="Kristen"]The fact that the stars move without a trace is enough to terrify most people.
[name="Kristen"]To believe that the stars are mere pawns of an undiscoverable being, that their movements and trajectory changes hold any meaning is obviously the more reassuring choice.
[name="Kristen"]However—

Kristen extends a hand toward the planetarium.

The dome of Galleria Stellaria enveloping the ceiling suddenly opens itself.
False starlight floods the laboratory.
Kristen makes a series of gestures with her hand, and in an instant, the planetarium completely transforms.

As if everything is as it should be.

[name="Kristen"]If the trajectories are really just invisible, then how have we avoided colliding with other stars throughout the last millennium?

[name="Kristen"]Can you help me move that 'planet' over there, Saria?
A small metallic sphere passes by Saria's hand.
'Star.'
Instead of touching it, she lets it fall out of orbit.
[name="Kristen"]What a shame.
[name="Kristen"]I've been fiddling with these planets before we break the barrier, and no matter how many times I try, they just refuse to stay on the right track.
[name="Saria"]...Stop this, Kristen.
[name="Saria"]We still have time to turn back, before you hit the barrier with this Galleria Stellaria.
[name="Kristen"]'Galleria Stellaria'... isn't it exactly as how I described it to you before?
[name="Kristen"]A pity that you had already left Rhine Lab by the time I built it.
[name="Kristen"]But I knew you would come back. At the very moment when my dreams were about to be realized... you would be there.
[name="Kristen"]Whether or not you're with me—
[name="Saria"]......
[name="Kristen"]—Or against me.
[name="Kristen"]This time, it's my turn to make the first move.
Kristen lifts her hand, revealing the exoskeleton operating system Saria is most familiar with, and gently makes a fist.
Silver liquid spews out from the planetarium behind Kristen, and in an instant, all the planets are thrown out of their orbits, rushing towards a single position at a speed too fast for the naked eye.
The entire galaxy pours down on Saria.
