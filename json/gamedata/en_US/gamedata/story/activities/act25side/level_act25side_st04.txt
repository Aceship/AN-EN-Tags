[name="Jara"]I just flipped through the geographical magazine in this car, and if we continue this way for ten more kilometers, there should be a winery up ahead.
[name="Jara"]The magazine says the wines there have an exceptional texture. The winery insists on a limited supply to only specific distributors, and for decades has refused to expand the scale of their vineyard... so I'm curious.

A wind blows from far away, and Jara adjusts her glasses, lifting her gaze to the sky.
The clouds are moving quickly, and a single star faintly appears amidst the twilight. The sky appears as lofty as ever.
After a long time, she gently waves her hand. The driver thinks she was calling him, and quickly opens the door for her.

[name="Kristen"]The 'Universe'—The first time I learned of this concept from Friston, I had no way of envisioning how encompassing, boundless, magnificent, beautiful, and touching it could be.
[name="Kristen"]It stretches past our horizons, exceeding what we have constructed with our barren imaginations, beyond what words can describe.
[name="Kristen"]A pity I can only record my words as an audio file.
[name="Kristen"]From what I can see through this boundless curtain that has made it difficult to discern any colors, our 'Terra' is surrounded by stardust, with no fulcrum or rope supporting it as it rotates on its own and by itself.
[name="Kristen"]The stars blend into one another, and any measurement of distance, size or shape is meaningless. This 'universe' is so deep that it makes you speechless, it makes you feel... a deep sense of awe.
[name="Kristen"]As I observe with just the naked eye, the stars look similar to Terra, these were once in our visions, mere decorations dotting the night sky, but they share the same existence as us.
[name="Kristen"]Perhaps life also exists on them, the same flames of love and hate, terrible disasters, grand plans and romance, as well as mundane struggles and persistence, going onstage over and over again.
[name="Kristen"]Their history written by the creation and destruction of their civilizations, with innumerable magnificent miracles, names that shine, and bloated titles added onto the footnotes, before they all return to dust.
[name="Kristen"]Do they know a 'universe' exists? And are they our enemies, or neighbors we can get along with?
[name="Kristen"]......
[name="Kristen"]If it's possible, perhaps everyone should try to understand 'us' from this position, to understand the land, sky and sea we rely on to live...
[name="Kristen"]To understand where exactly we are in the history of humanity, and where exactly that entire history belongs in the universe.
