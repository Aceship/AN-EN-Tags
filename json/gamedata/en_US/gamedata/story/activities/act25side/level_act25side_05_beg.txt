Saria notices that Ifrit's hands are trembling. She wants to say something to comfort her.
But words fail her.

[charslot(slot="l",focus="n")]
She realizes that Ifrit is much taller than she was a few years ago, when she was rescued from the laboratory.

Saria turns back to look at the familiar streets of Trimounts.
The path she is about to tread suddenly feels unfamiliar.
She has overcome many challenges. What lies before her is far from a crisis.
But, for the first time, she feels out of control.
