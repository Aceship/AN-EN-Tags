[name="'Preserver'"]For the past ten thousand years... have you really lived on this land?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "char_003_kalts_1#1")]

[name="'Preserver'"]It seems you've changed quite a lot. We haven't interacted much, but you shouldn't be your current self.
[name="'Preserver'"]What did you choose?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "char_003_kalts_1#1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]I've seen wars lasting several millennia, the rise and co-existing of nations, and people growing from their misunderstandings and conflicts.

[name="Kal'tsit"]I've seen the cycle repeat too many times. The cycle itself looms large and weighs heavy, and I'm fully aware that time is running out.
[name="Kal'tsit"]And then, I ran into a unique opportunity.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I once met two Teekaz, who were closer than any creature in any era, to the truth of continuing civilization.

[name="Kristen"]The purpose of these journeys was not to observe the sky.
[name="Kristen"]The stars are not worth looking at——I came to this conclusion early on, after countless calculations.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_896_1#1$1")]

[name="'Preserver'"]Considering their approximate geographical location, and if they use what they might have in abundance appropriately, my guess is that what Kristen is doing right now is not necessarily out of the Ægir's reach.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "char_003_kalts_1#1")]

The gravity abruptly shifts without warning, and Saria feels only space beneath her feet.
She did not expect Kristen to set up an emergency escape door at the Galleria Stellaria's center.
No, Saria thinks to herself, she should have expected it long before. This door is not for the owner of the planetarium. Kristen knew that at the very last moment, Saria would come.

A torrent of energy pounds the accumulating area of this giant airborne construct, and the ring hovering up high looks almost swallowed by the tremendous amount of energy.
Immediately afterwards, an even greater amount concentrates at its core.
Enough to destroy any massive nomadic city.
And this world is just so puny and shallow, how could it ever bear it?
