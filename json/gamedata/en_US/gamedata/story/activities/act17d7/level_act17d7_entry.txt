[name="Emperor"]   Logic. Order. Common sense. Lay of the land.
[name="Emperor"]   Too many of y'all let that shit get to you. Suckers crawl outta bed to act like some boring-ass drones? Where's the joy?
[name="Emperor"]   Y'all tell me. Enlighten a man here.
[name="Emperor"]   Why's a healthy morning breakfast taste like trash? You really gotta get that report on 'if all Cautus ears grow long' done today? Does one plus one really gotta yield a result?
[name="Emperor"]   Boring.
[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=40, ystrength=40, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Emperor"]   Boring from the B to the G!
[name="Emperor"]   Wack-ass music's got me out of my vibe, we need more FIRE! More perception, more intuition, more enthusiasm!
[name="Emperor"]   The spark, the insight, the explosion, the unexpected! More flabbergasting, tongue-tying than any scripted performance, more attention-grabbing than this whole damn stage they rigged up!
[name="Emperor"]   Forget your comfort zone, your common sense, your logic! I wanna hear you cheer right now like no tomorrow!
[name="Emperor"]   There's only one truth standing in here, one miracle.
[name="Emperor"]   —And that's me!

[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3")]
[name="Promising Rap Upcomer"]   Your display on the stage forces our hand, Emperor.
[name="Promising Rap Upcomer"]   Your music, even your lyrics are the epitome of skin-deep. I could write a dozen of these musty tracks in a day. They ought to sweep your out-of-date flow along with 70 Percent into a pile of dead leaves.
[name="Promising Rap Upcomer"]   Let this fresh face show you all what music is about now. And I'll let you in too, on the meaning of true modern rap.

[Character(name="avg_npc_030")]
[name="MC"]   You haven't followed the industry for a while, have you, Mr. Emperor?
[name="MC"]   Plenty of talented singers have risen up lately, among which are some who brought their own sturdy core of supporters. There's no spitting on their strength.
[name="MC"]   Our Mr. 'Sandstorm Rudes' here is the one with the biggest buzz out of all the new faces.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Son's name is 'Sandstorm Rudes'?! Sheesh, name's so wack it's got me shedding.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3")]
[name="'Sandstorm Rudes'"]   Is it? I think it's quite good, for one.

[name="Old School Musician"]   Here, you young fellows, help me out now, boost me up.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   So what? This posse of store brand clowns is your big surprise for me? Do I have something wrong here? Can I get a confirmation this ain't the butt of a giant-ass joke?

[name="Emperor"]   Lay it out. How's this challenge gonna roll? Y'all gonna charge together or come one by one? I don't mind splashing a little of my precious time here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3")]
[name="'Sandstorm Rudes'"]   And I wouldn't mind bringing it to a past-man who can't keep up with the times.
