[name="Passionate Fan"]   It's over...
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1")]
[name="Fan?"]   Phew. I'm kinda dizzy.
[Character(name="char_185_frncat_1")]
[name="Excited Fan"]  It's over! Mr. Emperor won!
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   I pronounce this case closed!
[name="Emperor"]   What gave you fools the idea you could beat me? Y'all collectively saw something, or just went cuckoo?
[name="Emperor"]   But it don't matter. Program turned out pretty good in the end. More presentable than that fake-ass commentary before.
[name="Emperor"]   Another thing, some of those challengers out there were mad sus. Y'all got some shitty standards, for real.
[Character(name="avg_npc_030")]
[name="MC"]   Just another part of the nice surprise. I think the fine results speak for themselves.
[Character(name="avg_npc_074")]
[name="Old School Musician"]   Not half bad to me either. Quite entertaining, isn't it?
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Hey, drop everything for a moment. Why's this crusty rat allowed to sit there?
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3")]
[name="'Sandstorm Rudes'"]   I've been standing for too long. My legs can't handle it.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Pah! Why don't you roll straight back to your nursing home, then?
[Character(name="avg_npc_030")]
[name="MC"]   Anyway, congratulations to Mr. Emperor for claiming the win in this challenger round-robin!
[name="MC"]   We've prepared an absolutely imitationless sculpture in commemoration of our victor! Whether appreciability or collectability, it's worth its weight in gold!
[Character(name="avg_npc_074")]
[name="Old School Musician"]   Er, speaking frankly, I'd hardly want that prize even if you gifted it to me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3")]
[name="'Sandstorm Rudes'"]   Indeed. You might give yourself nightmares, displaying it in your home.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Y'all just don't know how to admire it!
[name="Emperor"]   Forget it. Don't give it to me, give it to those little friends of mine over there. They hit a pretty solid beat, and it ain't every day you get to share a stage with the Emperor. Need to really remember it.
[Character(name="char_185_frncat_1")]
[name="Excited Fan"]  Can I have it, really?!
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Cool it, cool it. If I say you can, then damn right you can.
[name="Emperor"]   What I say here goes. What, don't tell me there's still people who don't know? I'mma remind all you fools who don't get it, out of the kindness of my heart, one last time, one final time!
[name="Emperor"]   Listen careful. And then scream my name, worship me.

[name="Emperor"]   On this stageâ€”what I say goes!
