[name="Leonhardt"]  Besides, we're here because of a distress signal. It's encrypted the way the towns in the Rim Billiton outskirts do it, too. Phew... feels kinda complicated, y'know.

[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Cities and towns can't afford to take a direct hit from Catastrophes, so they have to pack up and leave as soon as they receive the Messengers' warnings.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  The people who live in the nomadic towns need to put the brakes on much of their entertainment, if not their normal lives and their work as well.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  They need to start working overtime to plan out an evacuation route, reroute their power from their entertainment and public facilities, and figure out how to tear apart and reconnect all their city blocks.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Their daily lives become disrupted all because of the news these “ominous” Catastrophe Messengers bring.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  If they actually observe a Catastrophe afterwards, the whole town will celebrate how they managed to dodge a bullet.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  They'll be so preoccupied with their celebrations that they end up forgetting who it was that risked getting Infected with Oripathy just to monitor the abnormalities out in the field to save their lives.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  And that's just your best case scenario.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Now, suppose the town evacuated successfully, and after weeks, maybe even months have gone by, they still haven't heard anything about the Catastrophe happening.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  As time goes on, everyone in town will start to hold the messenger responsible for disrupting their daily lives.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  And that will go on until the Catastrophe Messenger finally predicts a Catastrophe correctly years later, or perhaps until the Messenger is finally tired of all the contempt he faces and leaves for another town or sign up for dangerous missions like the Contingency Contracts.

[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#6",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  You really should've thought about going to some Yen city to become a driver, Leon.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#2",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  So that you could be a driver's bodyguard? Actually, what kind of drivers get to hire bodyguards? Armored truck drivers, perhaps?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#2",name2="char_253_greyy#5",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Pffh... haha, but I don't think armored trucks have backseats for passengers to uh... what's the word for that... “chew the fat?”
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#3",name2="char_253_greyy#5",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Oh, you know that saying, huh?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#3",name2="char_253_greyy#3",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Yeah! At the really big nomadic cities, there are lots of people who drive cars around for a living. Some of the Yen drivers are really talkative, too, right?
[name="Greyy"]  I learned about this from the teachers at Rhodes Island. They like to tell us interesting facts sometimes to liven the classroom up.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#3",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  But they don't really like to go into... the lives of the Infected during class.
[name="Greyy"]  I guess that's because a lot of us in class are Infected... and, maybe just like my parents, the teachers don't want to bring this up to the classmates who aren't prepared to face harsh truths like these.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Well, they probably don't want to rub their noses in it in front of everyone.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  I think there's more to it than that. You simply can't claim to understand the Infected's predicament just because you learn about it in class, and the teachers know that.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  The children who come from families rich enough to have them treated at medical facilities probably don't even know what exactly the Infected are before they become one themselves.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  At most, they probably just know them as the “bad kids” from the quarantine zone that their parents told them not to play with.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  In the more affluent cities, there are even critics who complain about the tragedies Infected characters face in dramas and plays, writing them off as the exaggerations of the playwright.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  The patrons who frequent the theaters always cry rivers when they see the noble and rich die for the non-Infected poor, but they laugh at cliches like the Infected getting swindled out of their savings for some miracle drug they ultimately overdose on.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#4",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  To the rich, the Infected might as well be hooligans who supposedly live in disgusting places. The hardships the Infected face are like some exotic legends and fairy tales. They might even think the Infected only have themselves to blame for getting Infected.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  And who can blame them? We all know only what we know. Anything we don't know might as well not exist in the whole world.
[name="Leonhardt"]  Just like how some people question why the Laterano guns shoot actual Originium instead of Arts energy beams, without even knowing guns that shoot the latter are just imitations.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=2)]
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=10, ystrength=12, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]

[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Hahaha, this just shows how people in the know can't possibly understand those who don't know. I mean, you've met all those carefree Lateranos and seen their guns.
[name="Leonhardt"]  Any caster should figure out right away the imitation Arts Units just take after the originals' shapes. They save their casters the trouble of having to aim and focus their Arts in exchange for a reduced output.
[name="Leonhardt"]  The Laterano guns are probably the exact opposite, though. They want precision and control and not a high energy output. At the very least, that's my guess—
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]

[name="Ayerscarpe"]  I don't think it really matters what you've done and how great or insignificant the results turn out to be. The goal that you're giving your all for is the only thing that matters. There's strength in your beliefs.

[name="Leonhardt"]  Take on the Catastrophes? Forget it.
[name="Leonhardt"]  I'm a little different from those Catastrophe Messengers who are fine with causing even worse disasters just to prevent the destruction that the Catastrophes bring and to soothe the fears of those regular folks.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#2",name2="char_253_greyy#4",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Huh? There are Messengers that extreme...?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy#4",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Now those are the ones who are really “taking on” the Catastrophes like you said. Messengers like me who just gather and deliver news are just small fry.
[name="Leonhardt"]  I said this earlier. The Catastrophe Messengers play an important role, but they take on a really big risk. Most people with this kind of knowledge and know-how choose to work at some kind of lab or organization instead.
[name="Leonhardt"]  Those of us who are ballsy enough to be doing this have either found a sugar daddy with deep pockets, have no other way out of the hole they're in like me, or are so firm in their beliefs that they're actually trying to take on the Catastrophes.
[name="Leonhardt"]  And out of those nut jobs, some of them are probably actually trying to give their lives for mankind, while others either have a grudge against the Catastrophes themselves or feel some sort of emotion in them that fuels their urge to take on the Catastrophes.
[name="Leonhardt"]  In a nutshell, they're a bunch of guys who are more than ready to sacrifice their lives and the lives of those around them to save even more lives. Some of them might even give up on that whole saving people idea just to get rid of any traces of the Catastrophes having ever happened.
[name="Leonhardt"]  My guess is that's probably not the kind of doing something for others ideal you have in mind, right?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Hmm... but I heard Rhodes Island has taken on missions like that too... You brought it up just now, too. Something like... Contingency Contracts?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  That's true, but those contracts are at most stuff like, fight some broke mercenaries that are trying to blackmail the small nomadic cities in the Catastrophe warning zones.
[name="Leonhardt"]  After all, Rhodes Island doesn't take on the kind of missions where we have to give up on saving lives just to fight the Catastrophes. Of course, it shouldn't claim to be any more noble than the rest of us and interfere with the choices we've made for ourselves either, even if it's their own employees we're talking about.
[name="Leonhardt"]  The Catastrophe Messengers' enemies are the Catastrophes themselves, not death. That's the nature of the job. That said, I should still be allowed to go about my responsibilities the way I want, and, of course, you are allowed to fulfill your responsibilities as an operator however you want too.
[Character(name="char_294_ayer",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=1)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  To put what he said another way, you should always look out for the opportunity to do what it is that you actually want to do, wherever it is you are standing at the moment.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  To Rhodes Island, some missions are probably more important than others; to other people, some accomplishments are probably greater than others; but to ourselves, there really isn't anything more sublime than being able to work the way you want to.
[Character(name="char_294_ayer",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Hmm... I never thought of it like that...
[name="Greyy"]  Am I being too impatient...?
[Character(name="char_294_ayer",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=1)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  You're just using responsibilities as a way to force yourself to do something. It's not just you. Many of those who survived the Catastrophes do the same thing, and this is nothing new to Catastrophe Messengers.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  That's not a bad thing in itself, but to take on even more responsibilities blindly doesn't really mean you yourself or anyone else will receive a greater redemption.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  There are those who are fighting to give you a better life. Don't let them down just to fulfill your own goals.
[Character(name="char_294_ayer",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"] Uhh... That makes me feel kind of bad for the doctors at Medical...

[playMusic(intro="$path_intro", key="$path_loop", volume=0.4)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Perhaps you shouldn't spend all your time reading those pointless, impractical Columbian invention magazines, then. Also, if my arguments were bullshit, I wonder what that makes yours.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#2",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Heh, I speak from experience, not out of my ass. So where were we? Something about work?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Now that I think about it, Ayers, you always say you aren't picky about work, but I haven't ever seen you take on bodyguard work for those stupid, self-conceited upstarts at Rim Billiton.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Hard to say I won't ever do it. Let me know the next time you take out a loan from one of them to get another dune buggy. I'll think about it then.

[name="Leonhardt"]  Alright, alright.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  I've got to say, though. You've really got balls, Greyy. This is your first mission outside, and it's a rescue mission at a Catastrophe warning zone.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  That's just because our mission is to help out a nomadic city that's stranded because of its electrical problems. Most of the missions we get are combat-related, and I try to stay away from those because I'm afraid of holding everyone else back...
[name="Greyy"]  I may have passed the operator examination, but I don't have any combat experience at all. I'm sure the real enemies out there are nothing like the practice targets we use during training...
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy#4",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Oh, but I guess I shouldn't worry about that as much as I used to anymore. Whether it's a combat mission or deskwork, they're all a chance for me to accomplish the things I want to do...
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy#3",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  I'll keep maintaining the electrical equipment, but I'll also train really hard! I'll make sure I'm not holding anyone back!
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy#3",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  You say that, but isn't helping out with the landship's power supply a whole lot of work to begin with? From doctors and patients to the combat operators, every everybody there needs electricity.
[name="Leonhardt"]  And I heard there was this one time you passed out while taking care of paperwork for the Doctor? He was so freaked, he called for the medics right away and took you to Medical. I heard you really got an earful that time.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy#6",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Oh... It's a little embarrassing...
[name="Greyy"]  I promised the Doctor I'd help review the electricity usage reports from the new operators that needed approval, but a set of transformers had gone out the night before.
[Character(name="char_294_ayer",name2="char_253_greyy#6",focus=1)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Hm? Shouldn't that be the electricians' job?
[Character(name="char_294_ayer",name2="char_253_greyy#4",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Oh, yes, they took care of the transformer repair work.
[Character(name="char_294_ayer",name2="char_253_greyy#3",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  But they also needed an Engineer Caster to inspect the Originium unit's output to make sure it was working. They also needed an Engineer Caster to check the energy conversion process, then there's also the cooling...
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#2",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  (Hm, look at that light in his eyes.)
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#2",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  (He's a professional.)
[Character(name="char_294_ayer",name2="char_253_greyy#3",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  ...The collecting pipe needed checking too. It's really complicated, but I have it all memorized!
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#6",name2="char_253_greyy#3",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Eh, this makes me wonder if the power system Closure designed actually works all that well, or if those energy hogs are working the equipment that hard.
[name="Leonhardt"]  We even have a kid here who's into getting worked hard by electricity.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#6",name2="char_253_greyy#5",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Hehe...
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#6",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  You know, this car is equipped with a data logger designed by our “highly intelligent Ms. Closure.” It has a voice recorder, too.

[name="Leonhardt"]  Huh? Closure, ignore everything I just said, okay? Please don't do anything funny to my equipment or my Arts Unit...
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#4",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]

[name="Ayerscarpe"]  And when have we ever been to the Iberian seaside?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#3",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  I did in a dream once. I couldn't use my Arts, and my throat was so hoarse because of the breeze there. You picked up some sort of funny sword technique. It's like, you attack and parry by tracing circles and whatnot.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#3",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Sounds like the most impractical thing ever.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Yeah, you said that in the dream too. You said following what a book says doesn't make it a combat technique, and that it's not a technique until you can wield it so skillfully that you can bend it to the needs of battle.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Who did he fight?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#2",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Some guy that was always jabbering. He wore a robe, I think. It was a dream; I don't remember that much about it.

[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy#4",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  There should be some three kilometers to go from here, but the road up ahead isn't very suitable for driving. Greyy, get me that portable terminal, will you? Thanks.
[name="Leonhardt"]  Hmm...
[name="Leonhardt"]  Well, this is probably kind of a cliche, but I've got some good news and some bad news.
[name="Leonhardt"]  Good news is, going by the data I've been collecting on our way here, we will have lots of time to prepare for the evacuation.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  So that's why it felt like you were in much less of a rush about halfway into the ride. But... you were using Originium Arts while you were driving?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Don't look at me like that, Ayers. The steering wheel's an Arts Unit modified by the craftsmen. I didn't take my hands off my staff to use Arts.
[name="Leonhardt"]  I'm sure both of you are aware, but making predictions based on the data outside the area tends to give you fairly inaccurate results. That's why, as a Catastrophe Messenger, I tagged along with you guys here to the warning zone to get more detailed data to work on that.
[name="Leonhardt"]  The Originium around here's still some time away from saturation. We should have at least half a month until we have to go.
[name="Leonhardt"]  As for the bad news... I guess the mission report this time is going a whole different direction than we expected. Can't say for sure yet, but it sure seems like it.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Which direction?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Hard to say. Might be both.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy#4",focus=2)]
[name="Greyy"]  Huh?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy#4",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Hm? Did I not tell you about this before?
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  You were wondering how to break it to him a while ago.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  Oh, right.
[name="Leonhardt"]  Well, we know Rim Billiton like the back of our hands since we were on the mining team, but I guess you don't know that much about this place, right, Greyy?
[name="Leonhardt"]  First, this distress signal isn't necessarily coming from a town that's in trouble. It might be a trap.
[name="Leonhardt"]  And suppose it's real, the signal might also attract rioters to loot the place.
[name="Leonhardt"]  And you know what would be really hilarious? If it's both. A trap that draws in some rough looters.
[name="Leonhardt"]  I've been measuring the signal's echoes on the way here, and it kinda feels like the number and density of people at our destination is kinda off.
[name="Leonhardt"]  For a town, there's too few and they're too packed together, but there's clearly a large amount of Originium products and buildings there. I sure hope the townspeople weren't kidnapped.
[name="Leonhardt"]  But well... We shouldn't have a lot of trouble taking care of them, as long as they aren't some pain-in-the-neck creeps like the Rusthammers.
[name="Leonhardt"]  Besides, we're still pretty far away, and even though the equipment we have on the car helped expand the range, it doesn't necessarily mean my Originium Arts were accurate. Maybe the whole town's just gathering in one spot, trying to figure out how to fix the equipment.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#2",name2="char_253_greyy",focus=1)]
[name="Leonhardt"]  But no matter what we're going to face, I guess you are ready now?

[name="Greyy"]  ......

[name="Leonhardt"]  Come on, stay with me. This is also the kind of life you want to know. The life far away from home and from the ship.
[name="Leonhardt"]  I guess you're probably hoping that it's your knowledge that our mission needs instead of combat skills now? Well, to us “operators,” it doesn't really make a difference.
[name="Leonhardt"]  There are bad guys everywhere, and they aren't much better than those bad guys back in your hometown when you left, but as long as you still want to, there's always something you can do for somebody out there.
