[name="???"]  You're leaving today?
[name="???"]  The Godmother only just gave you that staff, and all the things in the castle are still unsorted. Is it really so urgent?
[Character(name="avg_npc_151#3", name2="char_338_iris#2", focus=2)]
[name="???"]  It'll soon be time. No matter what, I cannot deliver things late.
[name="???"]  Don't forget. We abide by agreements, and we never break promises. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_151#3", name2="char_338_iris#2", focus=1)]
[name="???"]  I wasn't saying that. I just think it's all too sudden.
[name="???"]  You could've chosen something much simpler first. Like choosing a well-behaved child to welcome at the castle, or giving the boys and girls sweet dreams. That sort.
[name="???"]  It'd all be better than trying to find a girl from over ten years ago. We only know the name, and you lack any experience, Iris...
[Character(name="avg_npc_151#3", name2="char_338_iris", focus=2)]
[name="???"]  I do indeed lack experience.

[name="???"]  Now, now, enough fuss. No-one doubts your capability. We're all very aware.

[name="???"]  Hm-hmph.
[Character(name="char_338_iris", name2="avg_npc_150", focus=2)]
[name="???"]  You must stay safe outside, and safer still in front of strangers. Your transport is all ready. Remember to keep its parts maintained along your journey. Before you enter the wilderness, you must take full caution...
[name="???"]  Ah, I've gone on too long. Regardless of anything, prioritize protecting yourself.
[Character(name="char_338_iris")]
[name="???"]  I know... I understand. Don't worry. It may be quite trying, but it'll be fine.
[name="???"]  I must see this agreement through to the end. It's already been far too long since we set foot outdoors.
[name="???"]  The children believe in us, and that's why they give us their cherished belongings for our safekeeping. We must return them as arranged. We cannot let their trust be in vain.
[name="???"]  And so, even if they've grown up, and they no longer believe, I'll prove it to them still.
[name="???"]  I'll prove—
[name="???"]  that fairytales are everlasting.
[Character(name="avg_npc_150")]
[name="???"]  I see. Then may all go well for you.
[name="???"]  We look forward to your return. Iris.

Iris recalled the words she grew up with—To protect a paradise, a fragile dream, is never an easy thing.
It was only to fulfill a promise, to allow slumberland to last forever in the children's fledgling hearts. They always gave it their utmost, their all.
Dazzling dreamlands far-flung from reality became the gentle croons of nursery rhymes, broken into phrases kept in stories handed down across the land, down across hundreds and thousands of years.
She didn't want to give up.
She couldn't give up.
In fairytales, nothing was ever unachievable.
Within reality, achievement could only ask one's dedication to the task.

[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris#4", focus=1)]

[name="Field Operator"]  What's wrong? Didn't go well?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris", focus=2)]
[name="Iris"]  It's none of your business...
[name="Iris"]  How are her parents? Are they truly thinking about handing their daughter over?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris", focus=1)]
[name="Field Operator"]  I can reassure you, they don't want their daughter to leave their side. They just... can't think of another way.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris", focus=2)]
[name="Iris"]  And on the off-chance someone else finds them, what'll happen?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris", focus=1)]
[name="Field Operator"]  Hrm... I'm guessing they'd immediately take the poorly girl away, and throw her in an isolation ward. The parents are harboring hidden Infected, so in all likelihood, they'd be sentenced too.
[name="Field Operator"]  But you don't need to worry about that too much right now. I've already introduced them to somewhere reliable.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris", focus=1)]
[name="Field Operator"]  Obviously. But it's just a possibility I gave to them. It's up to them how they decide.

[name="Iris"]  ......
[name="Iris"]  That girl fallen ill still believes in fairytales. She's still that young.
[name="Iris"]  I can't help her... she's a good child, but I—don't have anything I can do for her. One story, one dreamland. None of it, nearly enough to rescue her from her ailment...
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris#5", focus=1)]
[name="Field Operator"]  But they let people have hope.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris#4", focus=2)]
[name="Iris"]  Huh...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris#4", focus=1)]
[name="Field Operator"]  I might not know what's gnawing at you right now, but I think stories and sweet dreams are good things.
[name="Field Operator"]  Wonderful things let people yearn, and let them have hope. In awful circumstances like these, letting people hold onto their longing for wonderful things like that, I think, is essential.
[name="Field Operator"]  After all, we need to first know what's good, and that's how we can have a direction to strive in, am I right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris", focus=2)]
[name="Iris"]  Then tell me about you. Do you believe in fairytales?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris", focus=1)]
[name="Field Operator"]  I believe in some things even more idealistic than fairytales. If those count as fairytales too, then yes, I believe.
[name="Field Operator"]  Don't let it weigh on you. There's so little we can do for others in the first place.

[name="Field Operator"]  Right, you said you were looking for someone before...
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris", focus=2)]
[name="Iris"]  What?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris", focus=1)]
[name="Field Operator"]  If you have no other trails, then I actually know a girl called Mabel.
[name="Field Operator"]  I know she was originally Victorian, she's twenty-odd, brown-haired, green-eyed, and very nimble with her hands, though she's not a lover of manual work. She just likes fiddling with machine parts.
[name="Field Operator"]  For the moment... she matches up completely with your account.

[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=10, ystrength=12, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Iris"]  —! She matches so thoroughly; this can't just be a coincidence!
[name="Iris"]  Where is she?! Tell me where she is!
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris#4", focus=1)]
[name="Field Operator"]  Mm-hm. I've actually gotten more sure the more I think about it.
[name="Field Operator"]  But, if she's really the one you're looking for, then you're actually a little late now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris#4", focus=2)]
[name="Iris"]  What do you mean?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", name2="char_338_iris#4", focus=1)]
[name="Field Operator"]  Certain things happening that probably aren't be up to me to tell.
[name="Field Operator"]  Or... maybe you should try going to meet her.
