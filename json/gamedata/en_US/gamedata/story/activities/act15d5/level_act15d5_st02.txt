On the endless barrens, a red-haired Vulpo man squats on the ground, concentrating hard on something.
Not far behind him is a car, undergoing inspection from a Lupo with white hair and a Feline in black.
The three of them seem like companions, and their ride, broken down.

[name="Chiave"]  Ha, of course you gotta. Aosta, you too. Don't forget, you two are my consigliere and underboss.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_346_aosta", focus=2)]
[name="Aosta"]  Mm. Chiave, you'd best stop talking now. Just rest nice and easy.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_346_aosta", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  *cough* *cough*...
[name="Chiave"]  Hey, Aosta.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_346_aosta", focus=2)]
[name="Aosta"]  What is it?
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_346_aosta", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  What do you think about dying out here on the barrens?
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_346_aosta", focus=2)]
[name="Aosta"]  Huh?
[name="Aosta"]  What are you talking about.
[name="Aosta"]  Weren't you gonna be head of the Thirteen Families? What the hell are you dying in a place like this for.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave#4", name2="char_346_aosta", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  Ha, yeah.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_346_aosta", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  But I thought about it kinda carefully just now. And nothing seems too bad about just dying here in the barrens, really.
[name="Chiave"]  All the big cheeses are gonna go in the ground someday. What's the difference between death in a wasteland and death on a bed that cost a couple million, huh?
[name="Chiave"]  Find a couple stones, dig a hole, lie them down in it, and then close their eyes.
[name="Chiave"]  Pow—one person's dead.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave#4", name2="char_346_aosta", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  Not so bad hearing it out loud, right.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave#4", name2="char_346_aosta#3", focus=2)]
[name="Aosta"]  Hold on, Chiave, what the hell are you saying?!
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_346_aosta#3", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  I'm saying, the sky today—cazzo, it's so blue—

[name="Broca"]  Aosta, he just fell asleep.
[name="Aosta"]  Goddamn you.

[name="Jaye"]  So, when you and the others got rescued by Rhodes Island, Chiave, that was when you joined them?
[Character(name="char_346_aosta", name2="char_272_strong_1", focus=1)]
[name="Aosta"]  Not at all. That operator, codenamed Straightedge, brought us all the way to the Rhodes Island office in Locomotiva, and then asked the medical operator stationed there to give Chiave some treatment.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_272_strong_1", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  Eyo, Jaye, you've got some real skill.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_272_strong_1", focus=2)]
[name="Jaye"]  Much appreciated. See, I always thought that was how you joined Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_272_strong_1", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  How? We didn't know them from Adam yet, and besides, Aosta gave the car over in exchange for the medicine. At the time, I actually thought Rhodes Island was pretty lousy.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_272_strong_1", focus=2)]
[name="Jaye"]  Haha.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_356_broca#3", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  But Rhodes Island's medicine's pretty effective, right, Broca?
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_356_broca#3", focus=2)]
[name="Broca"]  I can confirm.
[Character(name="char_346_aosta", name2="char_272_strong_1", focus=1)]
[name="Aosta"]  As for why we joined Rhodes Island, to put it simply, it's because Chiave offended one of the big family heads in Locomotiva, and we had people out for our blood again.
[name="Aosta"]  That time, Straightedge saved us again.
[name="Aosta"]  And then, under his referral, we just straight-up came to Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_346_aosta", name2="char_272_strong_1", focus=2)]
[name="Jaye"]  Got it.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_346_aosta", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  Heh. For the record, Aosta, that one was never my fault.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_346_aosta", focus=2)]
[name="Aosta"]  I know.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_272_strong_1", focus=2)]
[name="Jaye"]  It sounds like another new story all of its own.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_272_strong_1", focus=1)]
[name="Chiave"]  Heh, you got time, Jaye, brother? I'll tell it to you, in all its glory.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave", name2="char_272_strong_1", focus=2)]
[name="Jaye"]  It's already past midnight, and there's no missions tomorrow. I'll go get some Lungmen wine. We can drink and talk.
