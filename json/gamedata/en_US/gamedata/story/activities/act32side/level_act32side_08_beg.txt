But even more conspicuous is the blood spilled on the floor of the stairwell.
A trail of blood that has already begun turning black around the hole it emerges from extends all the way upstairs.

Just on the other side of the ignored wall, a grenade soars through the air and finds a place to lodge itself, ripping apart the surface.
The soldiers, their attention drawn away by Ela, do not notice the wall behind them until they are bowled over by a surge of shattered bricks, sweltering heat, and shockwave.
Before they can turn their weapons to the gaping hole in the wall, or even stand, the well-trained squad has already rushed in under the cover of their ballistic shields.
