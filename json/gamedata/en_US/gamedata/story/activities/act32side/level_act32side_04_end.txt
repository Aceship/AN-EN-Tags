Ela grabs the safety rope with both hands, twists her body out of the window, and stands on the outer wall trying to balance her suspended body against the wind.

Soon after, she lets go of the rope with her remaining hand and disappears out the window, leaving only a rope sliding quickly from the windowsill.

As the sky gradually darkens and the twin moons rise from the far side of the city, the moonlit concrete floor appears to resemble a frozen lake in winter.
As the two puppet dancers twirl on the ground, the moonlight highlights their bodies as they move to the castanets' rhythm, alternating between straightening and twisting.
Music pours out from the skyscrapers, roofs, alleys, and even some dimly lit windows.
This is an impromptu ensemble performance, without a rehearsal or conductor.
The sounds flow freely along with the puppet dancers' choreography.
Their skirts catch the notes landing at their feet, transforming them into a part of their beautiful dance.
The tall puppets lower their heads, watching those at their feet.
Those people, small and light as a feather, follow in their dance steps.
They leap into the air and come back down to the ground.

[name="Restorationist"]Señor Reynell, I've finished inspecting the box, and it'll take a few weeks to repair it.
[name="Restorationist"]But I've managed to reproduce a portion of the drum according to that hidden score. Would you like to hear it?

A melody pours out of the box, bringing Reynell back more than a decade, to a time when he hid behind a door to eavesdrop on the tinkling coming from his mother's workshop.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_461_1#1$1")]
