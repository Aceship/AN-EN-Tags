[charslot(slot = "m", name = "char_457_blitz_1#6")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "char_457_blitz_1#6")]
[name="Blitz"]That was the inspiration for its design, but as for what it does, thanks to Closure, it not only expands into a glider for distance, but also has a jetpack functionality for landing.

Blitz shoots Ela a questioning glance, but Ela simply shrugs her shoulders.

Reynell catches the backpack but simply stares at it without putting it on.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "char_457_blitz_1#4")]
[name="Blitz"]Sir, I think you should put it quickly. I like jokes as much as the next guy, but it's best not to joke around too much with your life on the line.

[name="Reynell"]Perfect. I recall that Ela over there said not too long ago she couldn't protect a man who plays jokes with his life.

Reynell retreats two steps, watching Blitz plummet from the edge of the balcony, wobbling around in midair as he flutters his way down.
Next up is Diaz. The tall man with the accent somewhat similar to Fuze's pats him on the shoulder before helping him pull the handle.
The people on the balcony leave one by one, until only Reynell and Ela remain.
Reynell still seems to be hesitant, so Ela activates both of their jetpacks before pulling Reynell to leap off the balcony.

Reynell takes off the backpack and goes into freefall.

Reynell does not know whether it is the swimming pool or cold concrete that will greet him at the end of his trip, but this time, he has no safety rope or backpack.
He tries to taste the difference between his weightlessness in this moment and bungee jumping, whether or not he is trembling, and whether this trembling is commensurate with the destruction he has wrought—
But before he can form any conclusions, he feels a round object squeeze its way into his hand, followed by a blunt pain in his back.
[SoundVolume(volume=0.4, channel="a",fadetime=2)]
Forced to open his eyes against the strong wind, Reynell vaguely catches a flash of Originium Arts, simultaneously feeling a number of small, hard balls pressing against his body in a struggle against gravity.
[name="Reynell"]...Golf balls?
He does not know if he was suddenly gripped by an urge to survive, or if the golf balls are exacting one last insult upon him, but whatever the case, Reynell accepts it.
The golf ball in his hand emits a similar light, drawing an increasing number of other golf balls in the vicinity towards his back like magnets, slowing his fall.

Reynell, after plunging into the swimming pool, bobs up and down a few times in the water before finally floating to the surface—
More precisely, a mat of densely packed golf balls is floating atop the water's surface, with Reynell lying on his back atop it.
He stands up steadily from the floating golf ball mat, even hopping back onto dry land in a single step.

Ela steps away from the side of the pool, but Reynell still feels the gaze of another pair of eyes.
A blurry figure seems to be standing on the other side of the pool, looking at him from afar. He cannot discern if the look on that man's face is one of concern or sadness.
The morning sun is dazzling, and he can't see clearly. But, he feels with certainty that the gaze resembles his mother's.
He turns his eyes toward the sky, no longer looking at that figure.
The man lingers for a moment, before leaving quietly, wearing a sorrowful expression.
Perhaps, he never would be the son who makes his mother proud. Perhaps, that man would not be willing to remain at his side.
In the end, he is still alone.
When he thinks on this, all the paranoia and grievance that had tormented him all this time suddenly seem insignificant.
He left in the end. In this moment, that is the only thought on Reynell's mind.

The sky is clear, and a gentle breeze blows in from the artificial sea. Though the draft is hot and humid, it is somehow also quite refreshing.
A warm, friendly din comes from Galería Krysztauowa behind her.

Other dazed locals also began sitting up, one by one, looking around in confusion.
The exhibition hall has become a lively carnival for artists.
Most conspicuous of all is the center of the hall, now converted into a dance floor where people are romping and reveling.
And all around the dance floor without borders, graffiti on self-extending canvas, sprawling cables laid out for rock 'n roll, popcorn movie reels...
Even the food carts are available to all. Artists, hostages, and even the police officers who are here to handle the case stop by.

[name="Community Artist"]Don't just stand there all stone-faced – this food's so good it's gonna make you cry! ...Hey, I'm doing you a favor here and you're still giving me that stink eye. What, you from Siracusa or something?
[charslot]
[name="Dossoles Police Officer"]What does being Siracusan or not have to do with anything? I just realized, you're the little shit who spraypainted my police car!

[charslot]
[name="Dossoles Police Officer"]Hmph. If you didn't do a good job getting everyone evacuated, I would drag you down to the station.
The police officer takes a big bite of the pizza, and remarkably, a streak of tears actually flows down his cheeks.
[name="Dossoles Police Officer"]It's just the pure spice that makes you cry, isn't it?!

Tecno shrugs and heads towards the dancefloor, her small frame quickly disappearing into the crowd.
The old firefighter squints his inebriated eyes, involuntarily tapping along to the rhythm of the music as he watches the never-ending parade of people on the dance floor.
That is, until a man approaches him from the other end of the exhibition hall, exuding an aura completely incongruous with the gaiety and joyousness of the event.
