[name="Voice on TV"]Last night, a pair of giant wooden puppets appeared in the street art community. Their magnificence shocked everyone who had the opportunity to see them.
[name="Voice on TV"]These fine puppets were created by one of the local artists, and during yesterday's rehearsal, they waltzed and fluttered under the moonlight.
[name="Voice on TV"]We can see from the video how they danced so elegantly under the artists' control. Almost as if they were alive!
[name="Voice on TV"]The neighborhood is known for violence, gangs, and homeless, contributing to a high crime rate. It's an area that most usually steer clear of. But despite the risks, the performance last night attracted lots of visitors.
[name="Voice on TV"]Now, let's go to our reporter on the scene and see what the attendees have to say.
