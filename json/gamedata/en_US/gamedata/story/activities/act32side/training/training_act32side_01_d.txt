[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_snakek")] Huh? Why are they attacking the <@tu.kw>Barricade</>?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] The drone we just took down has <@tu.kw>'Exposed'</> our Operators around its crash site.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Once an Operator is <@tu.kw>'Exposed'</>, enemies can launch a <@tu.kw>'Straight Shot'</> at them even if they are behind a Barricade. An <@tu.kw>Exposed</> Operator takes <@tu.imp>more</> damage as well.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] Thank goodness the <@tu.kw>Barricade</> will take a few <@tu.kw>'Straight Shots'</> before it crumbles... We must take out the enemies now!
