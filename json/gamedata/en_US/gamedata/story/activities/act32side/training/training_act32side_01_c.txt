We can position ourselves behind a <@tu.kw>Barricade</> to avoid being hit by these <@tu.kw>Straight Shots</>. These objects block the enemy's line of sight, and they normally won't make a <@tu.kw>Straight Shot</> at an operator behind an obstruction.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Of course, you can also deploy an Operator within the enemy's line of sight in order to bait out the <@tu.kw>Straight Shot</>.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_snakek")] Leave the baiting work to me!
