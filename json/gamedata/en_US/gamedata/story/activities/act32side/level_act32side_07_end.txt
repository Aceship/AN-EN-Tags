Shuffling emits from the center of the room.
A single soldier, biting his lip, shivering head to toe, hands clenched tight, turns his gaze away from the screen... and with a shudder, over his shoulder.
He sees, inside the room, out of nowhere... a bizarre woman.
He sees that woman's complexion and her hair, both just as pale.
He sees that woman point at him with a tremendous firearm the likes of which he's never seen before. No surveillance cam needed now. Those etched bullets can pierce straight through his heart in an instant.
He sees that woman standing there, and yet it is as though she's somewhere else entirely, as though she doesn't even draw breath.
He sees that woman whose head is crowned...
By a halo.

[name="Diaz"]Right now, I just need to dewire one by one, right?

Diaz stops talking, wipes the sweat off his forehead, and focuses on dealing with the chaotic nest of wires at hand.
He has to decouple fast, and unscrew the connectors right after, using an insulator to cover up the naked wires and avoid any short-circuits.
In a trance, his days with the Singas army float through his mind, where his job was always to secure the connectors in—
Diaz furrows his brows and smacks his lips, hands never stopping. What happened then has nothing to do with now. Now, he's no more than a firefighter in the middle of bomb disposal.
The wires are more or less decoupled by now. Just two left, and all risk of explosion in this area is gone.
He's gotten a handle of how to most quickly twist these connectors off. Push down for the first half, spin slowly, then start turning with all his might for the second half until it's off.
He counts down the rotations on the second connector. Now just seven, six, five...

Two of El Capitán's men charge for the old firefighter with sabers in hand, while three crossbows are poised on the floor above.
The old firefighter's hands freeze upon the connector, and for a spell, he's somehow not sure if he's meant to twist one way or the other.
