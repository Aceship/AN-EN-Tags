[name="Community Resident"]Galería Krysztauowa Exhibition Hall 2, Exhibit 14. An anonymous Minoan bard's manuscript from the night before Sargon annexed Minos.
[name="Community Resident"]How could such a beautiful poem, such a precious manuscript, end up bought by Reynell...
[name="Community Resident"]I learned Minoan just for this one poem! I'll recite it for you right now—
