[name="Voice Behind the Door"]It was a very loud note. Everyone stopped and looked at me... Does whoever wrote the music know what a trumpet is?
[name="Voice Behind the Door"]*sigh*... Get some rest. Tomorrow will be better...
[name="Voice Behind the Door"]You sure...?

[name="Voice Behind the Window"]I thought you finished your draft a long time ago.
[name="Voice Behind the Window"]Yeah, I did, but the app froze on me when I was wrapping up yesterday. I went out for dinner while waiting for it to unfreeze, and by the time I got back...
[name="Voice Behind the Window"]Ahhh‚Äî! Stop it. That's enough. Say no more!
[name="Voice Behind the Window"]Stop!
[name="Voice Behind the Window"]Wait, stop‚Äî! Stop moving around so much when you're clutching your head! My tablet's over there!

Soon, more soldiers in uniforms, all with stern expressions and armaments, emerge from all the streets and alleys around them and surround the neighborhood.
A few black trucks drive between them, churning a flurry of dust.
The men start unloading the trucks' contents masterfully. The sky may already be getting dark, but the objects they unload are shiningly bright.
They start to unfurl rolls of barbed wire in front of everyone, enveloping the whole community.
