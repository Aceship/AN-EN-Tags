[name="Iana"]Okay, let's go.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4124_iana_1#7$1",focus="l")]
[name="Iana"]Alright, I've taken a look from up high. The district is roughly divided into three areas: the outer ring, the residential district, and that building at the center.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_4125_rdoc_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Doc"]Which is always patrolled by guys with magic wands. There must be someone or something important there.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4124_iana_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Iana"]That's not important. We're steering well clear of it anyway.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_4125_rdoc_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Doc"]What about going through the residential area? I didn't see anyone armed. It seems to be a safe path.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4124_iana_1#7$1",focus="l")]
[name="Iana"]Or it could be more dangerous.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_4125_rdoc_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Doc"]True... common sense doesn't apply to this planet.

[name="Iana"]Look at the colored acrylic boards on the walls. Only people who think of this place as home would put up decorations with no practical use like those.
