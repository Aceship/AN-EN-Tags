[name="Ela"]Like putting up a huge portrait here?

[name="Miłosz"]Reynell wants everyone to see his father clearly. Anyway, it's just a portrait. Both Reynell and I believe Mr. Kowalski's merit goes far beyond that.

[name="Miłosz"]It's almost time. I'll take you to him.

[name="Miłosz"]He prefers people expend some kind of effort to come and find him. Everyone has to take at least one flight of stairs.

[name="Miłosz"]It's the only one in the Galería's office area, and these are the only stairs.

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1213_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Miłosz"]No, I'll be there at night.
