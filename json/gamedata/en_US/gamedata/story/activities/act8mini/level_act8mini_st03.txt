[name="Ace"]  Oh, Doctor.
[Character(name="avg_npc_026", name2="char_014_riope", focus=1)]
[name="Scout"]  Good evening, Dr. {@nickname}.
[name="Scout"]  We went to a drifter settlement yesterday while on field duty, and turned out something fairly interesting.
[Character(name="avg_npc_026", name2="char_014_riope", focus=2)]
[name="Ace"]  It's just industrial scrap. I've seen this stuff all over the western wastes. Not worth your time, Doctor.
[Character(name="avg_npc_026", name2="char_014_riope", focus=1)]
[name="Scout"]  But incredibly, it's industrial scrap that still works. It seems to be playing some kind of audio.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]  Music?
[Character(name="avg_npc_026", name2="char_014_riope", focus=2)]
[name="Ace"]  You'd be hard-pressed to convince me that's music.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]  The circumstances it was found in?
[Character(name="avg_npc_026", name2="char_014_riope", focus=1)]
[name="Scout"]  There was a strange machine in the middle of the drifters' settlement. Painted red, very heavy, and made strange noises when anyone came near.
[name="Scout"]  The drifters weren't too keen on approaching it, but they still set up camp around it.
[name="Scout"]  We ought to have moved it back. Dame Kal'tsit might know the specifics of its technology.
[Character(name="avg_npc_026", name2="char_014_riope", focus=2)]
[name="Ace"]  Spend cash to drag back a pile of industrial scrap? Have we ever had the luxury?
[Character(name="avg_npc_026", name2="char_014_riope", focus=1)]
[name="Scout"]  Perhaps that banshee might take a liking to it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_026", name2="char_014_riope", focus=2)]
[name="Ace"]  If you have some personal beef going on, I suggest you don't bring it to work.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]  Sounds interesting.
[name="Doctor"]  Time permitting, we can visit that settlement together sometime. Maybe I'll be able to tell you what it is.
[Character(name="avg_npc_026", name2="char_014_riope", focus=2)]
[name="Ace"]  Oh, looks like our gamble's gonna pay off, then.
[Character(name="avg_npc_026", name2="char_014_riope", focus=1)]
[name="Scout"]  Then it's settled. Once Her Majesty's affairs are worked out for the time being, together we'll go.
[name="Scout"]  And keep to that deal.

You awaken to an unpleasant mechanical noise.
A normal day.
Before your eyes is the ceiling of an ordinary living room in Rhodes Island. The furnishings look just as ordinary, though the hum of the ventilation system seems a bit deeper than in other cabins.
You know why. It is one of the most inconspicuous parts of your many peculiarities.
You wash up perfunctorily. This part isn't so different from ordinary people. You take special medication to maintain your condition. This part is a bit different from ordinary people.
Next, you don the full-body protective clothing that hampers your normal activities, but considering your physical condition, it is necessary. It may also be temporary, depending on your recovery.
These are all orders from Dr. Kal'tsit. According to her, you used to know more about these things than she did; but now, only she can look after your health.

The operators gradually disperse, and you find yourself sitting in the corner of the canteen, a rare occurrence indeed.
Rhodes Island, a place that makes you feel both at home yet also estranged, just like those clear but also unrecognizable memories. A pharmaceutical company with the primary goal of resolving the problems surrounding the Infected.
It is said that the past you was intimately connected to all of this. It is said that you played a key role in its establishment. It is said that you were the brains of Rhodes Island, and that Rhodes Island was the extension of your will.
A portion of what was spoken of has been slowly returning to you, but you are not sure if this is good or bad.
You have forgotten too much. Rhodes Island has welcomed you, but you don't know if you are worthy of its welcome.
Your breakfast lies before your eyes, a bland but healthy meal. You know that this, too, is Kal'tsit's work.
Over the past three months, your life has been filled with these feelings—
Everything is so strange yet so nostalgic. Conceptually, these feelings are completely contradictory, yet they manifest in front of you together.
Three months ago, during the sudden outbreak of rioting and conflict, they... Rhodes Island, rescued you from the epicenter of the turmoil.
In the ensuing conflict, too many people lost their lives.
So many of the deceased recognized you, yet you do not recognize them; So many of the deceased heard about you, yet you have not heard about them.
You gave your utmost, gaining greater respect in the process, and your hard work finally bore the fruit of victory. Yet that victory still came laden with inevitable pain.
Up until now... Up until now, you've had but one question, a question that you've repeatedly raised to yourself but have never been able to answer.
Is it all worth it?

Rhodes Island Integrated Bioprocessing Unit
Stretching out before your eyes is the most unique warehouse in all of Rhodes Island.
A large number of unclaimed objects are stacked in this warehouse.
A petite Perro operator is struggling to wipe down a badly-damaged shield.
You recognize the shield, and remember the former owner of that shield.
You remember that tall, somewhat slovenly operator who always sported a hearty smile. He was once your friend, or so you've been told. But you don't know anything.
You're weary of this repetitive, contradictory nonsense, but nothing better encapsulates the current state of your existence.
All the specifics sift through the cracks of your fingers. You extend your hand to catch them, but the fine sands of memory are dragged down by gravity and fall into the abyss, grain by grain.

You flip through a few photos. These old, yellowed, stained photos almost all depict Ursus people.
Most of the people in the photos are clad in ragged clothes, showing a mix of awkwardness, joy, or numbness when facing the camera.
On the backside of a silver pendant in the box is an engraving in the Ursus script—
—'To Ivana, my darling daughter. May she always know happiness.'
Among them are former enemies, as well as former friends.
You know that some of them fought against Rhodes Island to the bitter end, and you also know that some of them became allies of Rhodes Island in a time of crisis.

You are about to turn and leave, but a strange red shadow enters your field of vision. Curious, but just not enough to stop your movement.

Rhodes Island Landship, Lower Deck
The roar of machinery fills the lowest level of Rhodes Island, the area that provides power to the entire ship.
The Sarkaz Goliaths are the operators responsible for running it. On weekdays, the bottom level is populated pretty exclusively by technical staff.
You are wandering around aimlessly.
In these three months, you still have not set foot in every corner of Rhodes Island.
Rhodes Island is like a small nomadic city. Though much smaller in scale, it is still well-equipped.
Its internal structure is far more complicated than it seems at a glance, and the power plant is one such example.
