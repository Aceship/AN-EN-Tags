[name="Theresa"]Don't worry, I'm just a bit nervous. After all, you've known the Doctor for longer than you've known me, and I would like to leave a good first impression.
[name="Theresa"]There's just one thing though. Kal'tsit, you have some concerns about the kind of person the 'Doctor' is now, right? It's written all over your face.
[name="Theresa"]Let me find out as well, Kal'tsit. I'm really curious, what sort of person is that 'Doctor' who is so closely connected to your past?
[name="Theresa"]How should I go about it...? Meeting this Doctor, exchanging pleasantries, connecting the Doctor to myself and the Sarkaz... These are all questions I have to answer for myself.
[name="Theresa"]My opinion... can influence you as well, yes?
[name="Theresa"]So, Kal'tsit, take me to see the Doctor, won't you?

[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Yes, but the results aren't exactly a cause for celebration.

[character(name="avg_npc_056")]

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]No, I meant to say, you're a lot earlier than usual.
[name="Kal'tsit"]It's hard to imagine that the people in the Chairman's office would just let you go that easily, unless the result is so bad that there's nothing to talk about.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Even if that is the case, you... still did come a bit too early.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"] I guess so... but we anticipated this current situation... a long time ago, didn't we?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]What happened?
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]The Military Council has gained support, and our information channels throughout Kazdel are shrinking.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Babel will likely come under siege in the fall.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Some of the Sarkaz betrayed us, which is to be expected.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]They've only put forth a more demanding request. Don't worry, Kal'tsit, they're just targeting me.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]Theresa.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]What is it, Doctor? Ah... Right, I haven't formally solicited your advice yet, and it would be unbecoming of me to start giving orders rashly.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Doctor, it seems we'll need to get a bit further away from Kazdel. This calls for a full relocation, or in other words, a retreat.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Do you have a second opinion?
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]This might be the only option.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]If possible... I would have liked to give everyone more options. But we're out of time.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]The Military Council's ideas are both too heavy-handed and direct, and I stood firmly opposed to their ideology. But to prevent Kazdel from making unnecessary sacrifices, we'll have to leave, temporarily.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]I believeâ€” I truly believe, that we share the same heart, and the same blood flows through us. But even blood can be separated and transfused, and I don't know when we'll be able to merge again.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]At least for now, separating is the least damaging option.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]Every Sarkaz has a desire to follow her beliefs. I can feel your convictions, and there will be many Sarkaz following you.
[name="Doctor"]But I will not help you make a decision. I can only bear witness.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Yes. That's the best arrangement in front of us so far, Dr. {@nickname}.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Alright then, without further ado, the two of you should pack up and get ready to set out!
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]How much can we take with us?
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Unfortunately, not much. We may have to abandon a large number of our facilities. Ascalon will buy us time.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]That's more than enough, Theresa. You don't need to dispatch any more hands to help us. I'll bring the Doctor back to rendezvous with you safely.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Then we'll follow the pre-arranged plan, Kal'tsit. The person-in-charge will arrive later.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]But, Doctor, Kal'tsit, I'm sorry to make you evacuate in such a hurry.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]We'll have to put the research on hold for the time being... How I hoped to see the fruits that they would bear.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]I'll work hard to create a space where we can continue our research. Finally...
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]I believe things will take a turn for the better.

[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]Damned outsider! How dare you call Her Majesty by name...!
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Do you hate Kal'tsit...? Do you hate the Doctor?
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Just because they are not Sarkaz? Not because of what they've done, or what they will do?
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]Yes, that's exactly right, Your Majesty!
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]There are so many excellent people around you, so why do you insist on letting these outsidersâ€”
[Character(name="avg_npc_026")]
[name="Scout"]Shut your mouth!
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]......!
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Yes... I understand what you mean.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Allow me to ask one more question. Scout, what's your verdict?
[Character(name="avg_npc_026")]
[name="Scout"]I respect your judgment, but per my opinion, he should be taken into custody immediately and locked up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_026")]
[name="Scout"]According to military law, there can be only one outcome.
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Indeed, this is but one choice. We are always faced with countless choices.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]No matter what schemes or designs he may have, he will be unable to resist that desire.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]This won't be the last time you see actions like this.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Theresa, if your tolerance creates further troubles, it will eventually threaten your safety.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]He simply made an unfortunate decision.
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]No, Your Majesty...! P-Please, I can explain...
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]I am... Sarkaz... a Sarkaz of Kazdel...! I just couldn't bear the thought... of you and Babel being so far away from Kazdel!
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Initially, this was the thing I resisted the most. Underhanded tactics and tricks... If this was not the only way to achieve a lasting peace, I would not be able to swallow this pill.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]But the Sarkaz have been waiting for too long.
[name="Theresa"]Among the countless wars, we must utilize this war, along with equally innumerable lives, to open up this world and understand its emotions.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Kal'tsit, Doctor, this will be the attitude I have towards you. We share the same beliefs, and we can complement each other. Therefore, I choose to respect the Doctor's choice.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Doctor, please tell me how you'd like this to end.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]This Sarkaz... He carried out an act of betrayal, not against me, but against an image of Theresa in his heart that had disappointed him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]He cannot be called a traitor. As far as I can see, Her Majesty Theresa is willing to grant freedom to so many peopleâ€”
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]â€”Why not exile this Sarkaz, and see what choices he makes?
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]Let him fend for himself upon this land.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]He may find a new faith, maybe in you, or someone else.
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]â€”You... Why are you doing this...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]I'm opposed.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Even if the existing evidence does not prove his involvement with the Military Council, I do not deem it prudent to release a soldier who openly attacked his commander.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Theresa.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]Y-Your Majesty...
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Leave it to the army.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Yes, Marco, you are... a Sarkaz mercenary.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]So, Scout, take him to see Ascalon.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Babel will decide your fate. Ascalon will decide your fate.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]That you consider yourself a Sarkaz of Kazdel means you cannot leave.

[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]

[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]I've been waitingâ€” We've all been waiting!
