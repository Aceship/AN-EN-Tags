Columbia City, Tkaronto
The name's Dylan, Rhodes Island low-altitude aircraft pilot, and I'm currently running pell-mell around the city.
I should be sitting in the cockpit of my aircraft, joystick in hand. The only things I should be facing down are turbulence and terrain.
Instead, I'm clutching one half of an automatic assault crossbow in my hands, and hell, the first time I heard of this model was earlier this morning. Even just half of it is damned heavy.
My palms are all sweaty. If I have to end up in a warzone, I sure as hell shouldn't be on the ground, let alone in some dark alley in Columbia.
I just hope to God that my enemy isn't... Ugh.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#1")]
[name="Blaze"] Dylan, I got my hands full over here. Can you help a gal out and tell me what it says?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#1",focus=-1)]
[name="Dylan"] It says Police. The 'police' of Tkaronto.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#1")]
[name="Blaze"] He started it.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#1",focus=-1)]
[name="Dylan"] But it seems... probably not the real deal. A real botch-job if I've ever seen one.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#1")]
[name="Blaze"] At least he looked the part, pretty much the same as the guys up on the roof earlier this morning. Better than the ones that didn't have a uniform ready.
[name="Blaze"] So let me ask this question again: what kind of cops wind their automatic assault crossbows during questioning?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#1",focus=-1)]
[name="Dylan"] Columbian cops? 	
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#1")]
[name="Blaze"] Very funny. You know he's not a cop, at least not the kind we're used to dealing with.
[dialog]
[character]
I lift my eyes to cast a glance at the black-clad man collapsed in the alley, and then lower my gaze again to the half-a-weapon in my hands.
It was pointed straight at my chest just a moment ago, but now it's smashed into two pieces.
This 'policeman' is unconscious. If Blaze remembered the Doctor's instructions when she struck, then he should still be able to cling to life.
The Rhodes Island team arrived in Tkaronto yesterday.
No matter how many times I experience it, this kind of speed always surprises me as a pilot—
Rhodes Island is in the process of steaming to the Grand Knight Territory, and we've crossed over the entire western wastelands by air. The entire western wastelands, I say.
According to the plan, after Amiya and the Doctor finish their business, we'll take the same route back to Rhodes Island. The Grand Knight Territory might not have finished its urban subdivision assembly at this time.
All I know is Rhodes Island was invited to visit during the Kazimierz Major, but I'm in the dark about when and why. But anyway, the sooner we can head back, the better.
If I wasn't in such a hurry, I wouldn't mind taking a few days off to chill in the metropolis... but after this, I'm not in the mood for that anymore.

You want to say something, but you can't move your body.
You seem to be drifting in the void, everything before your eyes so familiar and yet so distant. These are a part of your memories, floating alongside you like fragments.
Like this, you continue to drift with your ceaseless thoughts, watching the familiar woman before you gradually fade away.
You open your eyes, and before you stretches an endless rocky desert. You see a strange, ugly iron bucket helm.
A peculiar man seems to be looking your way, but you cannot see his expression through that rough bucket helm.

[name="Cannot"] As for the truth, it is not at all important compared to the actual effectiveness of the analgesics.
[name="Cannot"] Of course you can tell these poor people, 'those drugs that you're taking can't actually cure Oripathy, but can best be regarded as expensive painkillers and placebos.' And then what?
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] You keep telling the truth, saying that even the best suppressants by far can't bring back their completely normal lives and that they will continue to be accompanied by sickness and pain until they die.
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] On the subject of Oripathy, Rhodes Island indeed stands at the bleeding edge in this world, so you know the truth. But is it a truth that they can stomach?
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]

You look over at Amiya. You watch her ears slowly droop, her eyes filled with sadness, then stained with helplessness.

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"] I... I still don't understand... what happened.
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] Simply stated... our clever friend here voluntarily surrendered to Columbian Customs and Border Protection, saying that your company had smuggled a batch of Oripathy-related drugs into Columbia.
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] If you know anything about Columbian laws, you should know that Oripathy-related drugs are the most strictly-regulated medical products.
[name="Cannot"] The company that lobbied to implement this law in the past spent a lot of efforts to monopolize the drug market in Columbia.
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] The information provided by our friend here definitely alarmed the Columbian Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Arts Units, and Originium, and they certainly aren't easy to deal with.
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] Per protocol, the Bureau's security forces went there in no time and seized all items in this smuggled product trade.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"] But, we have complete contracts and records of our cooperation with them, which should be easy to find...
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] Hahaha, that's the important part.
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] Miss Rabbit, when they chose to attack you, they had no intention of leaving any footprints. They have destroyed all evidence of this cooperation, and nothing would match up in the investigation.
[name="Cannot"] So what kind of situation will prevent a company from leaving behind any evidence of a transaction?
[name="Cannot"] What else but shady business.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"] So it was the Columbian government that seizes all the samples...
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] According to law, they will destroy these smuggled goods, and then? There's nothing after that. Mama John's is pretty much omnipotent around here, but what if the scope extends to cover all of Columbia?
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] Columbian Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Arts Units, and Originium. Their name might be a mouthful, but they have some competent people. And they'll be watching closely.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"] I understand now... But even with that being the case, won't Rhodes Island have a blackened record?
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] Hahaha, this is Columbia after all. There's not a company out there with a perfectly wiped rear.
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] Pay a fine, sign off on the ticket, and it won't be long until people forget about it— perhaps, people might have stopped caring already.
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] After all, in order to cover their ass, Mama John's might have inadvertently given Rhodes Island its best cover— and in case the Bureau really came for Rhodes Island, they would be the ones in trouble.
[Character(name="avg_npc_208")]
[name="Cannot"] Of course, your Doctor did spend three days in the Bureau's detention room, which is its own price.
