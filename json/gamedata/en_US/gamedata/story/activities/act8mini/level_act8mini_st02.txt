[name="Kal'tsit"]Dr. {@nickname}, I've scanned your brain seven times over the past month or so, and the results are always the same.
[name="Kal'tsit"]There's nothing wrong with your medial temporal lobe, and the neurons in other brain areas are as active as they are in most young people.

[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]There's no doubt that you've lost a lot of your memory. Even someone like you wouldn't be able to manipulate the results.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Those memories are episodic, chiefly concerning the subjective awareness of your identity, and even more so about all your experiences before you fell asleep in the Chernobog sarcophagus.
[name="Kal'tsit"]In contrast, your procedural memory has recovered extremely quickly.
[name="Kal'tsit"]From my reports or Amiya's and Dobermann's observations, this conclusion is clear.
