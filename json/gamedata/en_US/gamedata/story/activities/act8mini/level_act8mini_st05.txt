[name="Scout"]Commander, Dame, you're both here. Let me briefly explain what happened last night.
[name="Scout"]When my squad was sweeping the battlefield, they found traces of enemy troops that could be tracked. I made the decision that this was an opportunity to sniff out the enemy's position, insisted on giving chase, and ended up being ambushed.
[name="Scout"]The responsibility is mine alone, and I am willing to accept the army's punishment.

[name="Kal'tsit"]You are the leader of Babel, but you're also an Oripathy patient. Please take your health seriously.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I suggest you stop working and take a break immediately.
[Character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Kal'tsit, you still think too much about others... Oh, Doctor, please come in. We weren't discussing anything confidential.

[name="Doctor"]I heard everything, Your Majesty. You really should be getting enough sleep.
[name="Doctor"]That was a tense meeting we had last night. All that battle talk must have tired you out.
[Character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]No worries. Conversely, Doctor, I would like to apologize for the words spoken by some of the participants. They did not intend to offend, but were slightly agitated.
[name="Theresa"]They were worried about my safety, but I understand that you must surely have considered all possible situations. This is the best solution.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]Theresis wants to regain the initiative. He knows that your strengths are also your weaknesses.
[name="Doctor"]But what he doesn't know is how much you're willing to sacrifice for the Sarkaz people.
[name="Doctor"]When Ascalon's troops arrive in town, he'll see the writing on the wall.
[Character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]You're always so reassuring. Doctor, listening to your words is more refreshing than sleeping.
Theresa's weary face flashes a smile of relief, a smile that becomes gentler as she looks out the door.

[name="Amiya"]I didn't mean to stay up this late.
[Character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]No one is blaming you, dear. Let me guess, did you have a nightmare?
[Character(name="avg_npc_051")]
[name="Amiya"]No... I didn't. The soldiers moving around woke me up.
[name="Amiya"]I was looked out the window and saw Ascalon getting ready for a long trip with the other fighters...
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]They are on a mission.
[Character(name="avg_npc_051")]
[name="Amiya"]But... But, Ascalon said she would never leave me or Her Majesty.
[name="Amiya"]I was worried, so I snuck in here to take a look...
[Character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Amiya, my dear Amiya, the Doctor gave Ascalon a little job. They'll be back soon enough.
[name="Theresa"]Think about it, has one of the Doctor's battles ever run long?
[Character(name="avg_npc_051")]
[name="Amiya"]Y-You're right.. If that's what Doctor wants, I feel much better.
[name="Amiya"]Doctor is the best at making everyone feel safe.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]Amiya, you should rest.
[Character(name="avg_npc_051")]
[name="Amiya"]Okay I'm going to bed! Good night, everyone!

[name="Theresa"]What a sweet, lovable child...
[name="Theresa"]Doctor, before you came, I was a bit worried... about the safety of the Rhodes Island landship in Ascalon's absence.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]That's natural.
[name="Doctor"]Stretching his front line thin, encircling a small town with no strategic significance. There's no telling what Theresis's true objective is.
[Character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]My safety is secondary. I'm more concerned about the safety of the children and researchers on the ship.
[name="Theresa"]But as Amiya said, you really do give people a sense of security. What you've accomplished through your command leaves no room for doubt.
[name="Theresa"]Doctor, Kal'tsit, the day we win this war... shouldn't be far away, right?
