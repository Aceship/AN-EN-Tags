Far in the past, before the story of a knight's breaking of the tides was written into a novel, the deafening sounds of cannon fire and reverberating bowstrings could often be heard in the breeze blowing through the forests.
In those days, the masses firmly believed they were trapped in darkness. They cast the weight of life and death upon the earth, spilling blood as the price of both survival and remonstrance.
Now, as the late autumn sun beams gently down on the open plains, a farmer strikes his hammer rhythmically to repair his roof before the oncoming rainstorm.
In a graveyard at the foot of the mountain, a small group of men swing their iron tools, shoveling away dirt by the scoopful. As a chorus of sobs ring out in the background, they bury their withered crops into the earth.

[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#4$1")]

A large General Chamber of Commerce transport drives by. The white, spray-painted logo on the container stares down at the pedestrians walking by.
The transport's wheels drive over the dirt road, kicking up a trail of dust behind it as the engine's roar is carried away by the wind into the autumn wilderness.
The bladeless knight falls silent.
He and the iron behemoth stare at one another until it leaves him behind.

Beside the uneven grooves left behind by the truck's tires, the knight leaves no tracks whatsoever.

[name="Czcibor"]  We met by chance not far from the factories over there.

[name="Toland"]  Well, that sure is... worth a trip down memory lane.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  What was he doing here?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#2$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  I would guess he was probably lost. After all, it's been so many years since the last time we were here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#3$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Hah, perhaps you'd like to say that to his face?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#4$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  I'll pass.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  And here I thought he'd head toward Ursus. After all, he left the Grand Knight Territory in search of his family.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#2$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  But I also remember us speculating all those years ago that the northern winds and tundra his brother wrote about in his letters were made up, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#2$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  Only the top echelon of the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi knows the truth of where those two respected knights actually went.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Sounds like you haven't heard anything new during your years with the campaign knights?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#1$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  Regrettably.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#11$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  He's not the only one who can't get over it.
[name="Czcibor"]  I had a dream a couple nights ago. It was vague, but I remember us all gathered together, discussing where the two missing Nearls went.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  ...Let's just say he's here for a vacation, then.
[name="Toland"]  We haven't heard anything for years, and Młynar's not stupid.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Right, did you tell him about how poor the public order has been these days? He's in the neighborhood. He might just give you a hand.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#1$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  Yes, I was indeed hoping he'd help out. That's why I brought his weapon to the knightclub's craftsman for some adjustments.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Right, someone as particular about weapons as you wouldn't have been able to stand the sight of it, huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#1$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  Even if he had no need for a sword in his job, the Nearls must know some smiths in the Grand Knight Territory who could keep his weapon in a decent shape?
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Well, they do.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Remember that time we joined in on the action during that conflict with Ursus? Młynar ordered me to contact some knightclubs, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Those who later called my hunters 'Sarkaz Knightclub' are all old friends of the Nearl family.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  They used to follow Kirill and Schnitz, and they also saw how daring and spirited Młynar was on the battlefield.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Hell, his niece is a craftsman, too. She's young enough that she's got no idea what he's been up to, though. Almost threw herself into the whole mess with the Kazimierz Major, even.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  But given his temper, do you really think he'd ask any of them for help?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#2$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  Haha.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#12$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  If you ask me, I think he probably could've.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#12$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  ...Do you think he's still got any use for his sword, though?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#12$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  Would he still be willing to 'help take care of trouble?' And not out of friendship, but as a knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#1$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Where's this coming from?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#1$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  Because I've got a personal feud.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#10$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  For ten years, I looked up to the knight captain before me as my mentor. He never asked about my background, nor did he care if I'd offended any nobles. For that, I respected him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#10$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  And all that respect evaporated the moment I took over his position and all the paperwork of the entire knightclub.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#6$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  That was when I saw for myself the vile corruption behind the discipline and chivalry that I'd tried so faithfully to execute.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#11$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  I'm not trying to accuse every last campaign knight in Kazimierz... It's just that my position has always been a far cry from the glorious, noble knighthood I aspired to.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#5$1")]
[name="Toland"]  You sure you want to tell a bounty hunter that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#11$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  I've got to have at least have one old friend who'd listen to me vent.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#1$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  You know I just want to be an honest man who follow the rules.
[name="Czcibor"]  You probably think the code of the knighthood is inflexible, but at least it doesn't kill.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#6$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  At the very least... It wouldn't have let Celina die like that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#9$1")]
[name="Toland"]  She's gone...? When?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#10$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  It's been a few years now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#10$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  Sorry, it's not easy for me to bring this up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#1$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  Though... Młynar knows. Back then, when Celina was taken to the Grand Knight Territory, I wrote him a letter asking for help.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#5$1")]
[name="Toland"]  If she was taken to the Grand Knight Territory... That must have been quite out of hand.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#12$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  That's why he couldn't do anything for her, and I could understand that. I know he wasn't the one who got her killed, and I... I won't take it out on him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#13$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  But I never got a reply to that letter. Which is why when we met again today, I couldn't help but bring it up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#5$1")]
[name="Toland"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#12$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  If my letter had gotten buried under the pile of condolences for Kirill's death, then I could only blame myself for being unlucky.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#12$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  But he admitted to having received and read it... Yet he chose not to talk about the past, or to even acknowledge my hatred.
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#11$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  When did he become the sort of man who'd turn away when faced with questions of right and wrong?
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#5$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Oh...
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#5$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Well, then let me ask a little question.
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#7$1")]
[name="Toland"]  If you weren't going to ask the bounty hunters for help, yet you were going to drag him into your revenge plot...
[Character(name="avg_npc_625_1#5$1")]
[name="Toland"]  Were you trying to get him on your side... or is he another target?
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#12$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_627_1#10$1")]
[name="Czcibor"]  Please don't misunderstand me.
