To Młynar Nearl,
I haven't heard back in some time. It may be you're too busy with life in Kawalerielki to exchange letters with an old friend. I respect your choice, and I hope all is going well for you.
I've heard many anecdotes from the knightclub. Should we have another opportunity to convene, I'd be happy to tell you in person. My affairs are still a far cry from my ideal, but I've no regrets.
I only intend to waste so much ink on civilities. Let me be candid. I write to you for this reason:
Celina has been arrested, and sent to the Grand Knight Territory.
She is the most devout, refined knight I have ever met, a companion-in-arms, and my true love. I needn't say more.
You must remember her. Red of hair and signal flare, laughter that could smooth any furrowed brow.
So many a time she has led us out alive from places of death. I could never accept her being the first to leave us.
I swear on my knight's honor that Celina is innocent. Indeed it is her upstanding nature that has so bristled the murky-hearted politicians and merchants.
It is <i>not</i> right that a knight like her be a sacrifice to the petty stunts of such authorities.
Were we facing a foreign foe, be they the Shieldguards of Ursus or the Künsteritter of Leithanien, I'd be charging headlong at their ranks. Fighting until my armor is shattered, and my lance is in twain.
But against the National Council, against the General Chamber of Commerce, I am powerless.
Młynar, it pains me greatly to disturb your life of peace. Still, I have tried all else, and now I can only beg your help.
I beseech you. While I cannot do this myself, pass on this evidence in my place, and thereby clear her name.
For you are my friend, and you are a Nearl.
This is no lovesick entreaty, Młynar. That is not why I beg.
I simply ask that one worthy knight save another.
Sincerely, your old friend Czcibor
The letter had been opened and placed back inside its envelope.
It sat in a sea of so many other papers, stowed away in a jumbled drawer.

[name="TV Broadcast"]  Zeno Shelvin, ringleader of multiple Infected incidents, including the riot that took place days ago in the new district as well as the assault and clash with guards at the city entrance, has given himself up today.
[name="TV Broadcast"]  The suspect was a worker recruited from Gale Industries' 'Infected Help-Up Program.' He claims to have long been dissatisfied with his life, which led to him planning the recent riots...
[name="TV Broadcast"]  Gale Industries, the firm in charge of principal construction of the new district, stated they would work as fast as humanly possible to repair any damage to the buildings, alongside making reparations to residents.
[name="TV Broadcast"]  In addition, they plan to tighten up security administration and put an end to any similar incidents.
[name="TV Broadcast"]  We remind all residents that you are urged to take proper safety measures in the event you need to leave the city.
[name="TV Broadcast"]  We would like everyone to remain calm...

[Character(name="avg_npc_122#1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_123#1")]
[name="Ashlock"]  So... can I ask who you are?
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Enthusiastic Infected"]  Sorry, sorry, I got too excited. Forgot to introduce myself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Enthusiastic Infected"]  I'm Zeno, one of the Infected here to work in Dzwonek. I guess I <i>am</i> a foreman, to be exact...
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#1")]
[name="Flametail"]  We heard there were Infected in Dzwonek setting up a mutual aid group. Are you part of it too?
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  How I should put this... Well, you see, the Infected here weren't originally allowed to live in the cities.
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  Gale Industries started constructing a new sector here some time ago, and they needed a lot of hands on deck for that, so they hired a few Infected and brought them in to work.
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  At first, everyone felt like they'd gotten a once in a lifetime chance for some honest work.
[name="Zeno"]  But gradually, you heard more and more complaining. A lot of people got the sense they were paying us way too little compared to regular folk.
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  It's not like we were ever going to get as much as they do, but some things are worth trying. Just like how the Blood Knight fought for a new path for Infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  So, I was really in support of us organizing to protest against Gale Industries.
[name="Zeno"]  But after that... well, you've seen what it's like outside.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#6")]
[name="Flametail"]  So, the rioting, the raids... that was all Infected hired by Gale?
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  No, not anymore, not all of them. I've got no idea where all those people came from...
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  I don't even know... how they can think of so many ways to commit violence.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_122#8")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  Oh, yeah, what are you two doing in Dzwonek? Sightseeing? Maybe an exhibition match?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#1")]
[name="Ashlock"]  Actually, we're not even competition knights anymore.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#1")]
[name="Flametail"]  Now we're partnered up with a drug company dedicated to curing Oripathy. Our work's different, but our ideal of helping more Infected sure isn't changing any time soon!
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#1")]
[name="Flametail"]  And we're here precisely to bone up on what living conditions are like for the Infected in these parts.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#3")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_123#1")]
[name="Ashlock"]  If you're a knight sports fan, then I'm afraid what we're here to do is going to disappoint you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  Excuse me? Who cares about those fancypants money-knights with their sponsored gear and their dumb show-fights?
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  Anyway, can I just, I know it's a little awkward, but like I'll ever get this chance again... Ashlock Knight, can I get your autograph?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#5")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_123#1")]
[name="Ashlock"]  Oh, but I do have a signature from the Radiant Knight with me. And I may as well give it to you; you'd probably appreciate it more.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#1")]
[name="Ashlock"]  It's okay, I've got more chances to meet her in future—
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_123#5")]
[name="Ashlock"]  Huh...? Why?
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  The Radiant Knight's really great and all, strong and upstanding and everything...
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  But for us regular Infected, seeing knights like you standing in the arena is even more of an inspiration.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2")]
[name="Ashlock"]  Sona, lend me your sword for a sec.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#6")]

[name="Flametail"]  But hey, you need more than a few goons to stop us!
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  It's dangerous as hell here... Whoever you saw along the way, that was only a tiny fraction of the guards.
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  A giant group of them could be here any moment! Get out of here, quick!
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#1")]
[name="Flametail"]  We're here to take you with us!
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#1")]
[name="Flametail"]  I don't know what kinda tricks Gale Industries is up to, but if they really want to catch whoever started the riots, they're gonna have to do it by the book.

Flametail's sword comes quick as a flash. The instant she hears a footstep, she thrusts her rapier behind her like a shooting star, but it fails to make it far.
Its blade is firmly in the grasp of a gauntlet-wreathed hand, rendering her unable to even pull it back.
Until the figure in the shadows lets it go.

[Character(name="avg_npc_122#1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_122#1")]
[name="Flametail"]  Our goal might be to rescue Mr. Zeno, but now that it's reached this point, his hidden motive for refusing to escape might just be the key to this whole Infected riot conundrum.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#1")]

Młynar suddenly turns to look behind him.
The Pinus Sylvestris knights follow his gaze, but the end of the alley is empty. The only thing to be seen is the decorative dome of a faraway skyscraper, its neon lights twinkling a romantic wine-red in the dark of night.
It hits Flametail that she doesn't know what this Nearl is here to do. He isn't even armed—but if he needs it, she'd totally be willing to lend him her own sword.
[Character(name="avg_4064_mlynar_1#9$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  I can't tell you...
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#1")]
[name="Flametail"]  Mr. Młynar just talked over your circumstances with Gale. That means they don't plan to give you any more trouble. No need to worry.
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  O-Okay then...
[name="Zeno"]  You guessed right. Gale Industries was under pressure from all sides with the recent Infected riot, and they had to come up with an explanation that'd satisfy everyone. And my family really needed the reward they were offering.
[Character(name="avg_npc_626_1#1$1")]
[name="Zeno"]  As for why they weren't willing to give the workers a proper investigation, I've got as little clue as you do.
