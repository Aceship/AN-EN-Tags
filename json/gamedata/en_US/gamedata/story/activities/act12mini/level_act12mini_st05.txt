'Do not let those whom you are tasked to protect suffer with you, nor should you obsess yourself with reforming the wicked and gathering the weak.'
There, he scolded you. Satisfied?

The night wind is chilling, and the only sound in the darkness is the rushing river.
The factories stand quietly in the river valley, their massive steel silhouettes illuminated by their lights.
People still believe they can bring back the sunset, a time when blood and fire had warmth, when there was a long path ahead of them.
Now, though, there is no time to reminisce.
No time for nostalgia, or anger at all that has changed.
