[name="Margaret"]Back then, looking at the illustrations in those knightly legends, I always thought the female leads were drawn based on Mother.

[name="Old Knight"]Back when I was still a campaign knight, I'd never seen a young man better suited for the word 'talented.'
[name="Old Knight"]Even setting aside being Kirill's oldest son, he was unstoppable. Legends about him were already spreading like wildfire when he was still a squire...
