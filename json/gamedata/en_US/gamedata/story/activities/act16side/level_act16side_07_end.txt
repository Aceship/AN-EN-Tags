[name="Yvangelista XI"]Correct, but you are calling the wrong premise into question. The law is naturally constant... but our 'interpretation' isn't really as 'ever-changing' as you are making it seem.
[Character(name="avg_npc_356_1#1$1")]
[name="Yvangelista XI"]Interpretation isn't a coincidence, Andoain. Do you understand?
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]You said 'the old don't have the luxury of possibility.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_356_1#1$1")]
[name="Yvangelista XI"]The law is much older than either of us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_356_1#1$1")]
[name="Yvangelista XI"]The apostle does not interpret the law. The law interprets itself. Why do you think the law is capable of this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_356_1#1$1")]
[name="Yvangelista XI"]Take a look at these—Oh, my apologies. I made such a mess here—these structures, statues, stained glass, the exquisite domes and frescoes all around us.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]Do they seem like they have constructed a particular illusion for us?
[Character(name="avg_npc_356_1#8$1")]
[name="Yvangelista XI"]Do you recall the 'Revelation?'
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]If we knew it to be absolutely temporal, even if we deconstructed it into ice cold, objective logic...
[Character(name="avg_npc_356_1#1$1")]
[name="Yvangelista XI"]Regrettably, man will still shine a spiritual light on it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_356_1#8$1")]
[name="Yvangelista XI"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_356_1#2$1")]
[name="Yvangelista XI"]There has only ever been one true law.
[Character(name="avg_npc_356_1#1$1")]
[name="Yvangelista XI"]—We are to continue our existence.
