[name="Oren"]Senior Ezell, you underestimate a Legatus. You thought your movements would be hard to track? Or did you think you were so thorough, you left zero trace along the way?
[Character(name="avg_4036_forcer_1#9$1")]
[name="Ezell"]Your Excellency... If you're going to take Cecelia away, can I at least ask you a few questions first?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]Hahah, you're funny, senior. You think I have to answer what you ask?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]But I'm not such a cruel man... so shoot.
[Character(name="avg_4036_forcer_1#9$1")]
[name="Ezell"]Just who is Cecelia?
[Character(name="avg_4036_forcer_1#6$1")]
[name="Ezell"]Was she... born a fallen angel?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]
[name="Oren"]Colorful imagination, Ezell.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]But it's not as mysterious as you think.
[name="Oren"]Cecelia's mixed-blood, that's all.
[Character(name="avg_4036_forcer_1#2$1")]
[name="Ezell"]What? That's not possible... A Sankta's mixed-blood child can't be a Sankta!
[Character(name="avg_4036_forcer_1#9$1")]
[name="Ezell"]There are very few cases of Sankta mixing blood with other races... but it's not rare enough to alarm the Lateran Church...
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]
[name="Oren"]You know the reason perfectly well, then.
[name="Oren"]Offspring of Sankta and other races don't become Sankta.
[name="Oren"]A Sankta and Feline's child turns out Feline, a Sankta and Forte's child turns out Forte.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#8$1")]
[name="Oren"]Mixed Sankta offspring don't get their halo and wings of light when they say their first word, and they can't empathetically sense other Sankta.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#8$1")]
[name="Oren"]To put it simply, they won't have any of the Sankta's distinguishing features. Without exception...
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]
[name="Oren"]That's the generally accepted wisdom, anyway.
[Character(name="avg_4036_forcer_1#7$1")]
[name="Ezell"]Cecelia is an exception.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]
[name="Oren"]She's a Sankta who shouldn't have turned out as one.
[Character(name="avg_4036_forcer_1#9$1")]
[name="Ezell"]My second question is, should Cecelia is taken to the Basilica, how the Lateran will... treat her?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]
[name="Oren"]I don't know.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#9$1")]
[name="Oren"]Don't give me that look, Ezell. If I was going to lie to you, I'd feed you a much kinder one, no problem.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#7$1")]
[name="Oren"]But the reality's what you see. Cecelia is an 'exception.' I couldn't tell you how the Pope is going to handle this.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]
[name="Oren"]But this Holy Father of ours... I don't know what impression you have of him, but, well.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#9$1")]
[name="Oren"]At least, as I'm given to understand, he's not known to use extreme methods.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]
[name="Oren"]And look at how cute Cecelia is. How hardhearted would someone have to be to harm her, right?
[Character(name="avg_4036_forcer_1#6$1")]
[name="Ezell"]Third question.
[name="Ezell"]I cannot entirely trust your answers... I wish to accompany Cecelia to the Basilica.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]
[name="Oren"]Um, is that a question?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]Sorry, but that's the one 'question' you'll have to forgive my answer on...
