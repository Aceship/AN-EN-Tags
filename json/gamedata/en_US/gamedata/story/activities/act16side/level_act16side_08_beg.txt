[name="Fiammetta"]Apologize, Andoain.
[character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#2$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]Right now. Get on your knees and apologize to Mostima and Lemuen!

[name="Fiammetta"]Do you think you did nothing wrong?!
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#6$1")]
[name="Andoain"]I have made countless mistakes.
[character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#2$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]You're still pretty damned smug, aren't you?!
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#6$1")]
[name="Andoain"]God forbid.
[character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#7$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]Listen up, Andoain. I don't give a damn what your beliefs are, nor do I care if all your beliefs have gone to shit.

[name="Fiammetta"]Lemuen forgave you. Mostima forgave you. Yvangelista XI forgave you. Even if all of Laterano forgives you... I will not.
[name="Andoain"]I'm so sorry, Fiammetta.
[name="Fiammetta"]I'm not the one you should be apologizing to.
[name="Andoain"]If I had the chance, I'd probably do the same thing all over again.
[name="Mostima"]Are you for real? You'd say that in front of Fiammetta?
[name="Mostima"]And right now, you're not...
[name="Fiammetta"]Very good, Andoain.
[name="Fiammetta"]Take out your gun.
[name="Andoain"]You know that won't accomplish anything.
[name="Fiammetta"]You think I care about accomplishing something?! I in malam crucem! You think that if I kill you right here, Lemuen gets eight years of her life back?! Or that Mostima gets the whole rest of hers?!
[name="Fiammetta"]Pedicabo ego te et irrumabo! Accomplishing something!
[name="Fiammetta"]I want revenge for the sake of getting my goddamned revenge! Do you get that, Andoain?
[name="Andoain"]Are you so completely obsessed, Fiammetta?
[name="Fiammetta"]So what if I am?
[playsound(key="$bullet_loading")]
[name="Fiammetta"]I'll say it one more time, Andoain–– Take out your gun!
