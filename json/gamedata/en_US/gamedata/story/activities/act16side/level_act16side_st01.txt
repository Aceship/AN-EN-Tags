The Legati.
A special Messenger division established under the auspices of the incumbent Pope.
Laterano had previously held a detached position, maintaining neutrality among the central powers.
As such, Lateran officials were sometimes tasked by foreign powers with relaying critical information between different parties in the course of diplomacy.
This role was normalized and institutionalized with the establishment of the Legatus system. They have become a special force moving between the nations.
With Laterano's absolute neutrality as a foundation, the Legati aim to promote the circulation of important information between countries.
1098: via the Legati, the Pope sends an invitation to all nations of Terra:
'Gather for a conference at Laterano. I invite every nation to dispatch its envoys for a discussion regarding our collective security.'
1099: the Legatus system celebrates its thirtieth anniversary.
In March of that year, Legati from all across Terra proceed for Laterano together with the envoys of numerous nations.
