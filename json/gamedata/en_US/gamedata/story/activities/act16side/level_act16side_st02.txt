[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]Er...
[character(name="avg_npc_361_1#5$1")]
[name="Velliv"]Just in case.
[character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]There is reason to believe that Executor Richele may be his accomplice. Should I summon him?
[character(name="avg_npc_361_1#5$1")]
[name="Velliv"]No need. He'll only claim to have been tricked by an old classmate, now won't he, Oren?
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#5$1")]
[name="Oren"]Remind me never to pick a fight with you again.
[character(name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]
[name="Velliv"]I'll let Richele be. For now.
[character(name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]
[name="Velliv"]But I would like to speak with him through you, when it's convenient. You don't have a problem with that, do you?

[name="Oren"]N-No, not at all.
[character(name="avg_npc_361_1#6$1")]

[character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]What is it?
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]I've been thinking. It couldn't have been easy to deduce that it was Feoria who met with the Sarkaz, just from a few sentences in a journal.
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]Why were you so obsessed?
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_361_1#4$1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#3$1")]
[name="Oren"]What exactly is your relationship with her?
[character(name="char_279_excu_4#2")]
[name="Federico"]A distant relative.
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]
[name="Oren"]Hahahaha!
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]Seriously, man.
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]

[character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]I don't have time.
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]You do, because I happened to run into an infamous fugitive a few years back. By the name of Arturia.
[character(name="avg_npc_361_1#3$1")]
[name="Velliv"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#3$1")]
[name="Oren"]Wait! Calm down, Velliv!
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#3$1")]
[name="Oren"]I wasn't looking for her! It was a coincidence!
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#8$1")]
[name="Oren"]Seriously, I like to think of myself as a veteran, but just thinking back on that experience sends a shiver down my spine.
[character(name="char_279_excu_4#4")]
[name="Federico"]Where did you see her?
[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#8$1")]
[name="Oren"]Three years ago, in Leithanien.

[name="Richele"]Good. I've already contacted them.
