Cecelia's mother forbade her from going to the Notarial Hall, or from approaching executors.
An executor showed up before Cecelia's mother went missing.
Cecelia's mother went missing.
Cecelia was almost abducted by a suspicious Liberi, whose name is likely 'Patia.'
Patia said Cecelia cannot be given over to the Notarial Hall or the Lateran Church.
And finally, something's... wrong with Cecelia's halo.

Would it even be possible for me to extricate myself from this, at this point?
No...
