[name="Oren"]*Sigh*... You're a stubborn one, aren't you, Federico?
[Character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]As are you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]I thought you didn't have a mission... Aren't you practically on vacation?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]I don't get it. Is there a reason you can't get off my case? What did I ever do to offend you?
[Character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]My last mission was in Siracusa, to recover the personal effects of a local Sankta.
[Character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]Among them was a notebook. In it, he wrote that he once saw a female Sankta come into contact with a male Sarkaz.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#7$1")]
[name="Oren"]Alright, I can see why you'd look into that, but what does it have to do with me? I'm decidedly male, in case you can't tell.
[Character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]I followed all the leads I had and found the Sankta woman's address: 7-265 Via Thervatius, Pagus Stevonus.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]And when you made it there, you found that she'd already passed away.
[Character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]That's correct.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]So you had no choice but to keep following her tracks. Then you found she had been taking suspicious trips, and that she always contacted a specific Legatus before she left on her journeys...
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#4$1")]
[name="Oren"]Hahahahaha, this is good. This is very good!
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]And here I thought I gave myself away in Victoria or left some evidence after I talked to Andoain. Never would I have thought it was because I helped Feoria out of the goodness of my heart.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]This might just be some kind of fate.
[Character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]Are you done musing?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]*Sigh*, Federico, if my hunch's correct, you probably can't feel what I'm feeling right now. Yes? No?
[Character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]Yes. And I do not care.
[Character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]The emotions of those I arrest are not my concern.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]Does that mean you care about the feelings of anyone you're not arresting?
[Character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]No.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]You and I are the same. Neither of us cares for empathy... The way I see it, we could be great friends.
[name="Oren"]Actually, I think Laterano could use more people like you.
[name="Oren"]Someone who doesn't let their empathy get to them, always doing things by the book.
[Character(name="char_279_excu_4")]
[name="Federico"]I don't disagree. Perhaps I could pay you a visit in the penitentiary after your trial and we could discuss it more.
[character]
[name="???"]So, that's your reason, Oren?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#6$1")]
[name="Oren"]Well, here comes the worst of my troubles... Why must an honest-to-God good guy like me be blessed with such rotten luck?

[name="Velliv"]Cecelia's existence is a threat to Laterano. You don't want this threat to be wiped away... not because you want to see it executed, but because you want to use it to make a deal.

[name="Oren"]It really makes my heart ache, you know? It's such a windfall, but no one's trying to touch the pile of money.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]And you think there is?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#8$1")]
[name="Oren"]Velliv, how much do you know about Victoria these days?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]You wouldn't understand just how close we are to war.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]And at a time like this, His Holiness put up all the political capital he accumulated over the last couple decades... but even though he managed to get most of the countries to bend, the envoys who showed up... they hardly have any weight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]In more peaceful times, maybe we could use this as a foundation and slowly pave our way forward.
[name="Oren"]But we don't live in peaceful times. There's no time for us to dilly-dally around if we actually want to see his ideals put into practice.
[name="Oren"]I saw a lot of even dirtier moves in Victoria, with my own eyes. I won't say it's the right way to do things, but if doing the right thing doesn't get us to the finish line—
[name="Oren"]Tell me, would you rather be a woman of integrity?
[Character(name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_361_1#7$1")]
[name="Velliv"]Oh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]After traveling out there for so long, I'm buying less and less into the idea that Sankta are special.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]We've got the empathy thing, we feel what we feel. That's it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#2$1")]
[name="Oren"]What just happened, though... Even I have to admit... I felt something ancient and primal... and it originated in my heart.
[Character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]
[name="Oren"]Moreover, we got ourselves a trump card.
[name="Oren"]All those envoys are gathered here in Laterano, and we are blessed with a miracle.
[name="Oren"]What does that mean? What could it mean? There is still a lot for us to do, isn't there?
[Character(name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]
[name="Velliv"]I think you might be mistaken about one thing. You think there is no place for the Summit of Nations during troubled times... I suggest you look at this from the other side.
[Character(name="avg_npc_361_1#7$1")]
[name="Velliv"]That said, I think you have the right idea about one point. There are certain things that His Holiness can't do himself, and I also don't think there's any harm in having a backup plan.
[Character(name="avg_npc_361_1#6$1")]
