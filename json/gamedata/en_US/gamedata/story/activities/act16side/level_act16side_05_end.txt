[character(name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1")]
[name="Apostolic Knight"]Brothers and sisters, I propose we immediately declare a state of emergency across the entire city. Andoain is already enough trouble to deal with, but now we have a 'mixed-blood Sankta' on our hands too.
[character(name="avg_npc_361_1#3$1")]
[name="Velliv"]Gun-Knight Giovanni, the conference is set to open soon. Surely you know that a state of emergency would lead to panic among the envoys?
[character(name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1")]
[name="Apostolic Knight"]Your Eminence, we face a dangerous element. If a little panic could solve the problem at hand, I consider that an easy win.
[character(name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]
[name="Velliv"]His Holiness has been planning this conference for years... the 'Summit of Nations.' It could be the key to Laterano's primacy on land as we know it, but now... a panic threatens to destroy this key.

[character(name="avg_npc_355_1#1$1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1")]

[name="Apostolic Knight"]...You may.
[character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#6$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]I'm sure you all know that Mostima and I used to... work with Andoain.
[name="Fiammetta"]The Andoain I know isn't one to go off half-cocked. He wouldn't start a war without preparing for it. So even though he could sow chaos in Laterano, he wouldn't do it without a reason.
[character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#7$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]The only clue the Astray have given us so far is their attempts on the mixed-blood girl called Cecelia.
[name="Fiammetta"]We can surmise that taking her is their primary objective.
[character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#8$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]And since they already have her in their possession, I think Andoain's next step is very likely to be... exfiltrating Laterano.
[character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#7$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]Therefore, I suggest we focus on the two following points.
[character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#7$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]First, we need to step up our border controls and deploy more guards to the crossings. We should also form a special elite squad to locate their hideout and bring Andoain in.
[character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#7$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]Secondly, to be on the safe side, I would like the Seventh Tribunal to lead the investigation into whether the Astray have made contact with the visiting envoys to determine whether or not they are targeting the conference.
[character(name="avg_300_phenxi_1#8$1")]
[name="Fiammetta"]As for the conference itself...
[character(name="avg_213_mostma_1#1$2")]
[name="Mostima"]Proceed according to plan, right? That's what you have in mind, isn't it? We're just testing the waters, anyway.
[character(name="avg_213_mostma_1#7$2")]
[name="Mostima"]Oh, I've got to say, though. The cold buffet's desserts are disgusting. The cactus tarts are an atrocity. I would like to see some improvement there.

[name="The Pope"]I think there's a certain charm to the taste.
[character(name="avg_npc_361_1#1$1")]

[name="Andoain"]People will always fight. Neither 'gentleness' nor 'understanding' can stop that.
[name="Andoain"]A lot of times, when people fight, it's not because one side is right and one side is wrong. It's because the things that both sides have to do conflict with each other.
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]In other words, the things that you and I need to do are different, and that means we're in somebody else's way.

[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]Because, for a lot of people, the path that they take is determined by the path itself.
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]For example, the Sankta and the Sarkaz. No one can say why the two sides fought each other at first, but the hatred between them has paved the road for everyone.

[name="Cecelia"]Can't we choose our own path?
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]We can, Cecelia, but it's not that simple. If you want to leave the path you are on and find a new path forward, you must first make your way through a boundless wilderness...
[name="Andoain"]It's vast and empty there. You might never find that new path, even if you give up everything you've ever known.

[name="Cecelia"]Sure, Mister Friar. Go ahead.
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#6$1")]
[name="Andoain"]Many years ago, when I was still young, I ran into some... setbacks, and then I left.
[character(name="avg_npc_352_1#1$1")]
[name="Cecelia"]Where did you go?
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#6$1")]
[name="Andoain"]Anywhere. I traveled everywhere.
[name="Andoain"]There was a place I stayed for a while. It was a very small town, and it felt a little like my hometown.
[name="Andoain"]But it was even more run-down. Life was tough for everyone there.
[character(name="avg_npc_352_1#12$1")]
[name="Cecelia"](Huh? That doesn't sound like Laterano...)
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#6$1")]
[name="Andoain"]Once, I passed by the town's pub and came across a humming drunkard. He threw up all over me and insisted that I'd tripped him, and that I should pay for his drink.
[name="Andoain"]Everyone in the pub... no, everyone in town laughed at him and cursed at him.
[name="Andoain"]Those who were scared of him avoided him. Everyone called him a dirty, filthy moron, a lowlife, a sick scumbag... He was a Sarkaz.
[name="Andoain"]They never chased him out of the town, however. He kept living from one day to the next, doing little odd jobs.
[name="Andoain"]Then, on one windy, rainy night, a night when no one would go outside, the church's bell started to ring. It was an alarm, and it woke everyone up... There were... some bad people in town.
[name="Andoain"]It was lucky that the bells woke everyone. It was hard, but we chased the bad people away. No one knew who rang the bells, and we all thought it was a miracle...
[name="Andoain"]I headed in the direction of the bell tower and reached the wastes beyond. There, I found the church watchman digging a grave. Next to him was a cart, and in it a thin coffin, with the Sarkaz drunkard inside, wounded all over.
[name="Andoain"]I started to help digging. The watchman kept complaining as he dug. He said he was saving the casket for his mother and it was a waste to give it to a Sarkaz. Then he complained that he'd have to bury the sick Sarkaz...
[name="Andoain"]The watchman said that, not long after the bells started ringing, the Sarkaz came and knocked on his door, telling him to run, before the man died at his doorstep.
[name="Andoain"]The watchman said that since he saw it was about to rain, he couldn't bear seeing the Sarkaz man sleep out in the streets, and so he let him into the bell tower for the night.
[name="Andoain"]He kept complaining and kept digging. Then, when he was finished, he stood in front of the grave and sang a song that the drunkard always used to sing, even though he didn't remember how the second half went.
[name="Andoain"]In the end, he complained a little more, and poured half a bottle on the grave.
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#2$1")]
[name="Andoain"]The winds through hills on high...â™ª Tail the hero's farflung stride...â™ª Over long ways long...â™ª Over briars and thorns...â™ª
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]Sorry, I don't remember it either.
[character(name="avg_npc_352_1#5$1")]
[name="Cecelia"]That's... the song that Mamma and Rosella taught me...
[character(name="avg_npc_352_1#5$1")]
[name="Cecelia"]So... the Sarkaz man rang the bell?
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]I think he did.
[character(name="avg_npc_352_1#11$1")]
[name="Cecelia"]So he was the hero that saved everyone?
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#6$1")]
[name="Andoain"]Maybe. I don't know if someone like him can be called a hero, but I think most people probably wouldn't want to call him one.
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]Maybe he was just trying to help the watchman who helped him.
[character(name="avg_npc_352_1#5$1")]
[name="Cecelia"]What about you, Mister Friar? Do you think he was a hero?
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#2$1")]
[name="Andoain"]What is a hero, Cecelia?
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#2$1")]
[name="Andoain"]I thought about it for a long time... but I know that the answer to this question doesn't tell us who the Sarkaz man was. Rather, it tells us who I am.
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#2$1")]
[name="Andoain"]I don't think he himself climbed up the bell tower to be a hero.
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#2$1")]
[name="Andoain"]But it doesn't matter if we sing his praises, look at him with scorn, or even forget about him. None of that changes anything about him anymore.
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#2$1")]
[name="Andoain"]All the questions that I pondered have nothing to do with him. Only me. Why did I witness this? What does it mean to me? How is it going to guide me forward?
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]It is always the living who are questioned.
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#6$1")]
[name="Andoain"]But I kept thinking and thinking, what if he didn't do what he did?
[name="Andoain"]What if he did it, but led the fanatics... the bad people to the bell tower?
[name="Andoain"]What if the townspeople couldn't fend the bad people off even after they got woken up?
[name="Andoain"]And what if... what if he even died on the bell tower, and no one ever found him?
[name="Andoain"]There are no guaranteed successes, and there are no choices that are certain to be right.
[name="Andoain"]So I came to this conclusion. On that rainy night, he climbed up the bell tower because he wanted to.
[name="Andoain"]It's the most straightforward conclusion, out of somewhat stubborn goodwill.
[name="Andoain"]Whether that's true or not doesn't concern him.
[name="Andoain"]He was a hero, no different from the hero in the song.
[character(name="avg_npc_363_1#1$1")]
[name="Rosella"]The winds through hills on high...â™ª Tail the hero's farflung stride...â™ª
[character(name="avg_npc_352_1#2$1")]
[name="Cecelia"]Over long ways long...â™ª Over briars and thorns...â™ª
[character]
Everyone starts humming the song.
Their quiet singing drifts throughout the room.
I feel peace.
In this Lateran evening.
A peace that I have not known for a long time.

[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]It's Laterano's bell tower. A very, very old tower made of stone. I often went there when I still lived in Laterano. It was so close to Heaven.
[character(name="avg_npc_352_1#1$1")]
[name="Cecelia"]Heaven... Is that where Mamma is?
[character(name="avg_npc_351_1#1$1")]
[name="Andoain"]If that's where you wish for her to be, that's where she is.
