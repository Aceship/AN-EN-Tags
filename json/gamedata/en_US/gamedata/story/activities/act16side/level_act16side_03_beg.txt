[name="Velliv"]Executor Ezell Pastore went to 7-265 Via Thervatius in Pagus Stevonus this morning to verify an identity, record a will, and retrieve a patron firearm.
[name="Velliv"]Around noon, Ezell appeared in Stevonus Central Hospital, taking in an eight-year-old Sankta girl and departing in an unusual manner.
[name="Velliv"]The resident of 7-265 Via Thervatius, Pagus Stevonus, Feoria La Porta, died of illness this morning and the body was moved to the Ecclesia Requietum.
[name="Velliv"]Only one individual is registered to 7-265 Via Thervatius, and the census pagus also records only one individual residing there.
[name="Velliv"]An investigation of twenty years of maintenance records at 7-265 Via Thervatius revealed that a basement had been added seven years ago, with contractor documents indicating that the space would be for storage.
[name="Velliv"]This is a file photo of Feoria La Porta and surveillance footage of the girl that Ezell took to the hospital.
[name="Velliv"]You must've already reached a conclusion about where the girl came from.
[name="Velliv"]Additionally, according to the report submitted by Ezell this morning, Feoria La Porta did not leave a will or an advance directive. The reason is quite clear: she hoped to avoid contact with the Notarial Hall.
[name="Velliv"]It is reasonable to infer that Feoria La Porta knew her time was short and sought to secure a future for her daughter.
[name="Velliv"]It is currently impossible to determine whether Ezell is the object of Feoria La Porta's entrustment, but based on Ezell's background, the probability is low.
