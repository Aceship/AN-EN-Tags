[name="Pasty-faced Gravedigger"] It'll all be a wasteland here sooner or later. It's not like you could stick wheels under the graves.
[name="Pasty-faced Gravedigger"] Folks want to leave behind some trace of their lives after they die... but it's all a pointless dream, sadly. Might as well ask for a cremation and have your ashes scattered in the wilderness.

[name="Andoain"]Cecelia, this isn't selfishness. Rather, it just means that, ultimately, everything that the living do is to mold and shape themselves.
[name="Andoain"]We hold funerals and say our goodbyes when our loved ones leave us, but it's also a respite for ourselves.
[name="Andoain"]It's a way to mark the road that we've trodden.
[name="Andoain"]Many grown-ups... use this as a way to find peace, but whether they truly find it, or indeed anything, isn't the fault of the funeral itself.

[name="Andoain"]I can't answer you that. I'm afraid I can't even say I've found it.
[name="Andoain"]It's a tough search, and a sad journey. It makes you wonder if the way forward ever truly exists.

The early spring mornings are still frigid here in Laterano.
Sankta funerals are often accompanied by laughter, music, sweets, and the occasional, inconsequential explosion.
The departed become one with the Holy Spirit and return to Heaven. This is worthy of celebration.
But there is another kind of Sankta 'funeral' unknown to other races:
On a certain hour of a certain day, a great sorrow will seize all Sankta by the throat. They will not be able to move, breathe, or avert their eyes.
Each and every fragile soul will be swept away as if by the floodwaters of a broken dam.
Yet neither the joy of the former nor the awesome power of the latter can be found today in the Ecclesia Requietum of Pagus Stevonus.
We find only a frail girl, trying her hardest to swing the absurdly unwieldy shovel in her hands.
A girl trying to shovel the last bit of dirt onto her mother's resting place.
