[name="Ben"]I love the food here. It's great stuff.
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#5$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]It's been a while, Ben.
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#5$1")]
[name="Ben"]It certainly has, Sicilia.
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#5$1")]
[name="Ben"]What brings you here, I wonder?
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#1$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]Any guesses?
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]If you just wanted to get the city back under control, you probably wouldn't come to me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#1$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]Bernardo understands the wolfpack, and his plans ultimately boil down to four words: don't rock the boat.
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#1$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]He's gotten the Dodici Famiglie all bloodthirsty, and that bloodlust doesn't quench easy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#1$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]But it's not too hard either.
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#1$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]But, I heard some other things from Agenir, and would like a little input from an old friend.
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]I don't have anything in particular to say. This is a legitimate dining establishment, and it needs a new head chef. That's about it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#1$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]I thought you'd have some feelings about the current state of Siracusa.
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]Nostalgia is also a feeling.
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#1$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]You're fickle, aren't you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]Do you really need my opinion?
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#1$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]Not really.
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#5$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]But I am interested in hearing the thoughts of a man born to civilization who's removed himself from it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]In every era, people are bound by the chains of the times into which they were born.
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]You don't escape from that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]Bernardo's ideals were an obsession born from your era.
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]He was stuck with using violence to tear it down. He couldn't get past that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_691_1#1$1")]
[name="Signora Sicilia"]What about his son?
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]Who can say? It's not like I can predict the future.
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]But you see it too, don't you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_694_1#1$1")]
[name="Ben"]We're watching the birth of a new era here.
