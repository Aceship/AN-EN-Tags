[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]When Sicilia came to visit Laterano, I was tasked with serving as her guide.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]However, I did not leave Laterano with her because I was persuaded by her ideals, as the rumors claim.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Sicilia was still young at the time, and no matter how talented she was, it was impossible for her to instantly come up with a way to change Siracusa after but a brief stay in Laterano.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Her ideals were puerile and unrealistic, but they happened to resonate with some of my own thoughts at the time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]We discussed and argued our ideas day and night until finally, I decided to go with her to Siracusa to settle them.
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#7$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]Discussing, and arguing...
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Yes.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Even after coming to Siracusa, we never settled the arguments between us. As a matter of fact, our views on Siracusa have never quite lined up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]But this does not prevent us from understanding what the other is thinking.
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#4$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]So, the key is discussing and arguing?
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#2$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Haha, what do you think?
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#8$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]I don't think that's right.
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#7$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]I don't think Texas and I ever had any serious discussions about anything. I'm not even sure when it happened, but we somehow became really good partners.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]You're a perceptive one, my child.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]In the end, what kept me bound to Sicilia was not ideals, convenience, or even emotions.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]But time.
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#7$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]Time?
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]The passage of time will bridge most gaps and bind people together, regardless of what they think about it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]You'll always be good partners, won't you?
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#9$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]Of course. Always and forever.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Then, all you need to do is keep moving forward.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#2$1")]
[name="Agenir"]You will experience many different things, as will she.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#2$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Perhaps your stories will individually have very little in common.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]But as long as your lives intertwine at some point...
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Well, you'll have nothing to worry about.
