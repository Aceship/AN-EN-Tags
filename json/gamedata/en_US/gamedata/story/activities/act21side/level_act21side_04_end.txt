As far as she was concerned, she's always lived life the exact same way. But, to other peopleâ€”
She was just like a Siracusan.
Was she just like a Siracusan?
She didn't know.
All she remembers is what she once said to her grandfather:
'People who keep going on and on about how life in Siracusa is nobler, or about life in Columbia is nobler, are all full of it.'
To which he laughed heartily.

[name="Leontuzzo"]Simple.
[name="Leontuzzo"]The attack on me and the assassination of Carracci both prove that someone wants the Dodici Famiglie at each other's throats.
[name="Leontuzzo"]And as Lavinia is a Bellone spokeswoman on the topic, she can't be allowed to find the murderer, or she would be able to bring the situation under control.
[name="Leontuzzo"]Therefore, now that Lavinia has arrested Cellinia, the other side can't let the trial proceed.

[stopsound(channel="a", fadetime=2)]
For the mafiosi of yesteryear, the unspoken rules were held above all else.
Signora Sicilia placed the shackles of the law around the necks of the famiglie.
Thus, a court of law was erected in every Siracusan city.
In Siracusa, the courts stand for Grey Hall's will.
And the judges are executors of Signora Sicilia's will.
The judges inevitably find themselves controlled by the famiglie, sometimes even submitting to them. However, every judge knows there is one line that cannot be crossedâ€”
They must prevent fights between the Dodici Famiglie.
Just as the Dodici all know their every move is always under the watchful eye of Signora Sicilia.
Thus, a delicate balance of power is established through the courts.
