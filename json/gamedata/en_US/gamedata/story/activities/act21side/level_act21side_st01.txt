Sora's sleep-assisting CD is still playing.

As for the carwash worker, she has only met him once.
A dream that has no meaning except to remind her of her Siracusan roots.

Since time immemorial, Famiglia Saluzzo has always been like this.

Alberto never allows anyone to question his decisions.

Lappland squints at her father.
This homecoming has not inspired a single shred of emotion within her.
She carries with her only a faint glimmer of amusement as to what might happen. Or rather, what she is about to make happen.
Because, she has been in such environments far too many times in her life.
She has returned.
The thoughts that inadvertently bubble up in her mind seem ever so laughable.

[Character]
Beside Texas lies the well-pressed suit that Famiglia Bellone has prepared for her.
She looks toward the tightly-shut door.
She knows what she is supposed to do.
To fulfill Zaaro's contract, she needs to exit this room, kill a few irrelevant people, create some chaos, and then finally, kill a few important people.
Irrelevant, or important. This is the attitude Siracusans have toward life.
She, too, used to think like that.
Even now that she has learned to see the world through a different lens, as soon as she stepped back into this city, she quickly realized that these practices were still ever so familiar to her.
She has returned.
The thoughts that inadvertently bubble up in her mind fill her with disgust.
