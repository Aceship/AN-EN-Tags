Looking at the unconscious mafiosi strewn around her, Lavinia can't help but be briefly lost for words.
Even with all this, Texas was still holding back. She thought she had seen it all in her time dealing with the famiglie, but this is still beyond her comprehension.

Along the way, Lavinia keeps running over a million different things to say.
There are too many questions she wants to ask Bernardo.
She imagines the countless arguments she'd have with him, as well as their outcomes.
She thinks she has mustered enough anger.
However, when she steps through the door, the scene she encounters shakes her to the core.

Bernardo sits upright in a luxurious chair.
In his hand rests a legal codex adorned with thorns.
The very same as the one she holds in her hands.
He lowers his head and rubs the tome lightly with his palms, as if completely unaware—of the thorns digging into his hands, of the bright blood trickling down.
Her chaotic thoughts all freeze in this moment.
In the end, thousands of words condense into one—

Lavinia turns to leave and does not look back, frightened of the tears about to roll from her eyes.
Bernardo remains in place, uttering not a single word as a few drops of his blood dye the floor.
