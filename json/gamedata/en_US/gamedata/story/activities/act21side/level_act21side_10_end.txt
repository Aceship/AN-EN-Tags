Not that Lappland has become stronger than Texas, or that Texas has become weak.

They were evenly matched from the beginning.
What determines the outcome is Lady Luck, perhaps... or more importantly, strength of will.
Seven years ago, Lappland lost the battle of wills.
But now, having said goodbye to the famiglia, her will is no weaker than Texas's.
Either may win, and either may lose.

Texas takes one look at Sora, then closes her eyes.
Lappland thought she knew Texas well enough.

She bore witness to Texas's exhaustion with Siracusa, and her decision to declare war on the country.
Texas's decisions surprised her each time.
But this time, she thought, it would not be so.
One lives, the other dies. There would be no other end.
But as she saw the unwillingness to let go in Texas's eyes, she once again realized that she was wrong.

Signora Sicilia casts her gaze at the four young people before her.
One who came from the strongest famiglia in Siracusa, whose upbringing made him long for a civilized future. Denied by his position, he chose to bury his head in the sand.
One who came from modest beginnings, who earned the favor of the famiglie. It filled her with doubt about herself, and so she chose to deceive herself.
One who came from the oldest famiglia in Siracusa, who hated everything that it asked of her. It drove her to rebellion, down a path of madness.
One who came from the strongest famiglia in Columbia, who became exhausted with the existence of the famiglia itself. She chose to run away in silence.
They want to change Siracusa for different reasons, but they all came together, in the end.
