A vague thought creeps across Alberto's mindâ€”this is his best chance to be rid of this monster.
That's right. Monster.
A monster he raised with his own two hands.
She is by no means invincible, but it seems like nothing is capable of touching her.
He is a hundred percent sure that if he strikes now, he would be able to slay his daughter on the spot.
She is by no means dauntless, yet she chose to throw away everything she had to throw away.
He knows he should act now, to rid himself of future headaches.
But...
'Padre.'
She is a monster. And yet, one that he raised with his own two hands.
If all she wanted was simple freedom, why would she still come to see him?
Lone wolves eventually remember the pack to which they belonged. But after today, his daughter will no longer belong to any pack.
Alberto lets out a heavy sigh.
