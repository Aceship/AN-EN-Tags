[name="Exusiai"]Hello there!
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#1$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]We came to ask you a few questions.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Hahaha! Good, good. Take a seat. It's never a bad day to talk to the youths.
[Character(name="avg_201_moeshd_1#9$1")]
[name="Croissant"]We got a friend who's all mixed up in a contract with of them families. They got her doin' all kinds of things for 'em.
[Character(name="avg_201_moeshd_1#9$1")]
[name="Croissant"]We've been noodlin' on whether or not there might be a way out for her?
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Your friend's surname is Texas, isn't it?
[Character(name="avg_201_moeshd_1#9$1")]
[name="Croissant"]...Yes.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]I've heard that Bernardo is a man of his word.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]As a don, he must never break his promises.
[Character(name="avg_201_moeshd_1#12$1")]
[name="Croissant"]But even us foreigners can tell all this hubbub is the Bellone family tryin' to rile up Signora Sicilia.
[Character(name="avg_201_moeshd_1#15$1")]
[name="Croissant"]We... ain't about to go stickin' our heads in all this complicated business. And to be honest, it don't got much to do with us, neither.
[Character(name="avg_201_moeshd_1#15$1")]
[name="Croissant"]But we don't want Texas gettin' any payback from Signora Sicilia.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#2$1")]
[name="Agenir"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#2$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Back then, Sicilia's fury towards Giuseppe for what he had done was just as great as her admiration of Salvadore.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#2$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Because it was the most direct challenge to the order she had established.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#2$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Sicilia accepts all comers within this order, but she will not allow anyone to upend the entire order.
[Character(name="avg_201_moeshd_1#12$1")]
[name="Croissant"]So what you're sayin' is... There ain't no loopholes in this order, izzat it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]I used to think that, my child.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]But there are no absolutes, when it comes to orders established by man.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Just as why me meeting you has nothing to do with Cellinia.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]It was just because I happened to meet a fellow Sankta here.
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#1$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]Heehee~
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Before Sicilia, the land of Siracusa was not without order.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]The only difference is the order that the families believed in came from themselves, and as no two famiglie could ever share the same order, they could only fight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Sicilia's actions did not completely break this order.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Instead, it unified the orders among different families into a single, universal standard.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]All the families were united into one.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]And thus, Siracusa became Siracusa.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Now tell me, do you know what this means?
[Character(name="avg_201_moeshd_1#15$1")]
[name="Croissant"]Yer sayin'... Siracusa, before n' after Signora Sicilia... never actually changed?
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]Clever girl.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]The problems that existed in Siracusa in the past still exist today. I, no, we, are all aware of this fact.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]But all these problems can be resolved by seeing Sicilia's fold.
[Character(name="avg_201_moeshd_1#9$1")]
[name="Croissant"]Meetin' Signora Sicilia... that's a tall order.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]That is one thing I will not help you with.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]But, for her, there might be a way.
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]However—
[Character(name="avg_201_moeshd_1#15$1")]
[name="Croissant"]However?
[Character(name="avg_npc_692_1#1$1")]
[name="Agenir"]The price may be too high to pay.
