[name="Texas"]And what I saw in Siracusa was no different from what I saw in Columbia.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1")]
[name="Texas"]You might know the story of Famiglia Texas like the back of your hand, but I saw it with my own eyes.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1")]
[name="Texas"]Life isn't a play where every move is sprinkled with a little heroism or villainy. What happened was just an undignified slaughter.

[name="Texas"]My father bought a counterfeit gun from Blacksteel. When he pulled the trigger, it exploded and did a number on him.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#6$1")]
[name="Texas"]My grandfather fell to the ground. My father drew his knife with his injured hand, but the first stab went wide.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#2$1")]
[name="Texas"]I heard everything from the doorway. Hoarse curses, groans of pain...
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#2$1")]
[name="Texas"]The commotion lasted for a long time before it finally ended.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1")]
[name="Texas"]In that moment, I was exhausted. Exhausted with everything.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1")]
[name="Texas"]So I decided to leave.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#1$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]Are you telling me that Lungmen is your home now?
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#8$1")]
[name="Texas"]I don't know. I can't say for sure.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#8$1")]
[name="Texas"]But, I at least know I had a pretty good time there.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#2$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#2$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]You're just like you were back then. Blunt, and straight to the point.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#1$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#1$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]Looks like I'm the one getting ahead of myself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#1$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]Here I was thinking you came to ask for my help.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#1$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]Or at least, you'd want to catch up with me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#2$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]But in the end, you're here to tell me... that we can never go back—
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#1$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]You know, Cellinia, that's awfully heartless of you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#1$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]I was shocked when I heard you were still alive.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#1$1")]
[name="Giovanna"]But you went ahead and stamped out my hope, all over again.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1")]
[name="Texas"]I'm sorry, Giovanna.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1")]
[name="Texas"]I don't want to be Siracusan, or Columbian.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1")]
[name="Texas"]I just want to be Cellinia Texas.
