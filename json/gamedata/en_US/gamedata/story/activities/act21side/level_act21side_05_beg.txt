[name="Caterina"]Sora, are you practicing your lines again?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#5")]
[name="Sora"]Oh, hi there, Miss Caterina.
[name="Sora"]We're about to start our performance of Act II of 'La Morte di Texas,' so I have to step it up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#10$1")]
[name="Caterina"]Oh, I completely forgot. Time sure has a way of sneaking up on you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#9$1")]
[name="Caterina"]Exusiai, would you like some pizza?
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#10$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]Sure would!
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#1")]
[name="Sora"]By the way, Miss Caterina, since you're the playwright, you'll be coming to watch the show, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#8$1")]
[name="Caterina"]Hmm...
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#9$1")]
[name="Caterina"]I actually wanted to tell you that I'm going away for a while.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3")]
[name="Sora"]Huh?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#1")]
[name="Sora"]For how long?
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#8$1")]
[name="Caterina"]Well... It shouldn't be too long, if everything goes as planned.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#9$1")]
[name="Caterina"]Don't worry, it's nothing major. Something happened back home, and as the eldest daughter, I have to go back and get everything under control.
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#1$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]Being a big sister is hard work, isn't it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#3$1")]
[name="Caterina"]Haha. It's not so bad.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#9$1")]
[name="Caterina"]Unfortunately, I'm still not sure what to do for the climax of Act III.
[name="Caterina"]*sigh*... Maybe I can find some inspiration back home this time.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]Alright...
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#11$1")]
[name="Caterina"]Come on, don't look at me like that. We just won't be seeing each other for a bit. I should still be able to find the time to come watch Act II.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#9$1")]
[name="Caterina"]Who knows, maybe I'll surprise you backstage and invite you out.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#1")]
[name="Sora"]Really?
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#9$1")]
[name="Caterina"]After all, I rarely get to make new friends, and I wouldn't want to miss the performance of a script I wrote myself.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#1")]
[name="Sora"]Right. That settles it then. If you're coming by, you have to let me know!
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#3$1")]
[name="Caterina"]Of course!
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#9$1")]
[name="Caterina"]I'm off then. Goodbye.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#1")]
[name="Sora"]Bye bye~
[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#1$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]See you later~

[name="Giovanna"]Of course. It is the product of my painstaking labor.
[name="Giovanna"]Also, didn't you just ask how we were going to respond?
[name="Giovanna"]That is my response, seeing how Bernardo Bellone is about to step away from his own theater.
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#13$1",name2="avg_npc_695_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Giovanna"]Naturally, I, Giovanna Rossati, ought to return.
