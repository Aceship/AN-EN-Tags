Ever since Texas took her first step back in this city, that question has always been on her mind.

But she is not worried.
She understands Siracusa well, and knows that there is no end to these things.
She simply feels a twinge of emptiness, one that even she never expected to feel. Becauseâ€”
No one will come to her aid in this fight.
And after it's over, no one will ask her if she's hurt, or drag her off to some party.
For her, this emptiness has long since been second nature.
So much so that even after leaving Lungmen for such a brief period of time, everything about that city already seems so distant and nostalgic.

Danbrown exits the store.
He watches as the judge he deeply respects drive off into the rain, quickly disappearing from sight.
'She's always so busy,' he thinks to himself, drying his rain-beaded gloves on his overalls.
But nothing she does will end up mattering, will it?
Or rather, the fact that she still holds onto hope is precisely the reason why she'll be disappointed again and again.
Things weren't this complicated in the good old days. He looks at the rain falling outside the store, and suddenly remembers an afternoon many years ago.
