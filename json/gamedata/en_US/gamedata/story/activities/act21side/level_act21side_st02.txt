[name="Sora"]Hard to believe, isn't it?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#5",name2="avg_npc_687_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Caterina"]No, I believe it.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3",name2="avg_npc_687_1#9$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]Really?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3",name2="avg_npc_687_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Caterina"]First, there's no need for you to lie. Second, I always thought there was a chance she was still alive.
[name="Caterina"]Now I understand why she suddenly showed up.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3",name2="avg_npc_687_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Caterina"]I guess she made a deal with the Bellones, and now she's here to pay her debt.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4",name2="avg_npc_687_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]Definitely sounds like her.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4",name2="avg_npc_687_1#14$1",focus=2)]
[name="Caterina"]But what a coincidence it is that you found the Compagnia dell'alba... (whispers) or perhaps it's no coincidence...
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#1",name2="avg_npc_687_1#14$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]What's special about that company?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#1",name2="avg_npc_687_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Caterina"]Nothing. It's nothing.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#1",name2="avg_npc_687_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Caterina"]The Compagnia dell'alba is a good place to start, if you want to get close to Famiglia Bellone.
[name="Caterina"]But... well, come with me.
