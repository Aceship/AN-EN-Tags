[name="Sora"]Wow, this place is breathtaking!
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#8$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Siracusans love to kill time here to the accompaniment of music and performance. After all, when reality is monotonous and difficult to change, people naturally need a place to indulge their fantasies.
[name="Bernardo"]Or, to equate their bloodstained business dealings with the legendary exploits of the heroes on stage to obtain a sense of moral satisfaction.

[name="Sora"]Wow... you really don't pull any punches, huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#8$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Of course not. In this line of work, we must be clear-eyed about our own profession, no?

[Character(name="avg_103_angel_1#7$1")]
[name="Exusiai"]'The Death of Texas'? That might be the crappiest 'joke' I've ever heard.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#4$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Hm? You seem to be well-acquainted with that name. That's fairly unusual among foreigners.
[name="Bernardo"]Siracusans rarely bring it up in the first place, and the mafiosi here are even more secretive about it. But the story of Famiglia Texas... is one that every mafioso must always keep in their hearts.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]It is a cautionary tale.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]A warning...
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Let's talk about the script itself first. There are countless works based on the deeds of Famiglia Texas, but not a single one dares to actually print the name.
[name="Bernardo"]Playwrights are more inclined to reimagine or adapt, with the help of allusion or parody. After all, it is against their interests to invite trouble.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#8$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]However, times change, and today's audience finds true history far more salient than fairy tales with falsified names. Wouldn't you agree?
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#9$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]As such, a remarkable individual has brought this script before us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#8$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]It's a play in three acts.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]The first act harkens back to the era when Columbia was first established, with many a Siracusan famiglia yearning for this undeveloped land.
[name="Bernardo"]Consequently, the famiglie each dispatched their own teams, one after another, joining the ranks of Columbia's first pioneers.
[name="Bernardo"]'In an era when chaos and opportunity came hand-in-hand, some were swallowed by the tides of the times, while others found in it their promised land.'
[name="Bernardo"]The cream of the crop among them was Salvadore Texas, a man who would later establish his very own era.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"](I know he means the surname and not <i>her</i>, but still...)
[name="Sora"]So, Texas is one of Siracusa's families?
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]To be precise, they were a famiglia that originated in Siracusa, but took root in Columbia.
[name="Bernardo"]Such famiglie are hardly unusual over there.
[name="Bernardo"]From beginning to end, though, old Salvadore saw himself as a Siracusan, through-and-through.
[name="Bernardo"]And the Siracusans in turn rewarded him for his perseverance, always affording him a Siracusan's respect.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]The Siracusans...
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]The second act chronicles some of the most praiseworthy episodes from his storied struggles in Columbia.
[name="Bernardo"]Siracusans can be found everywhere in the shadows of Columbia's history, and it is precisely amidst that tide that Salvadore gathered his famiglia.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#8$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]In truth, the contents of this act are the best known of the three.
[name="Bernardo"]Even across various retellings, they're almost always the same.
[name="Bernardo"]Accounts of 'the Siracusan in Columbia' can be found in over a dozen versions in any local bookstore, mostly romance novels borrowing the phantom of his name, so to speak.
[name="Bernardo"]Perhaps, there may even be a few words of truth among them.
[name="Bernardo"]If you're interested in that, I can point you to some of the less-outrageous ones.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#1")]
[name="Sora"]Ooh, I'd appreciate that! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Think nothing of it. Now, onto the third act - this is the one that can change most dramatically between versions.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]Because... it deals with the fall of the Texas Family?
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]That's right.
[name="Bernardo"]Outsiders only know one thing for certain about the fall of Famiglia Texas, and that is that—
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#2$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Salvadore was murdered by his own son, Giuseppe, who later declared that Famiglia Texas would break away from Siracusa's famiglia system.
[name="Bernardo"]This act angered Signora Sicilia, and incurred her retribution.
[name="Bernardo"]In a single night, the Texas name was wiped from existence.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]The entire Texas family disappeared... in a single night?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]At least, that's what every Siracusan believes.
[name="Bernardo"]As far as what exactly happened during the liquidation of Famiglia Texas, nobody except the parties involved have any way of knowing.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]Excuse me... How come there are only scripts for the first two acts here?
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]That is because the third act is not yet finished.
[name="Bernardo"]Each playwright will invariably imagine their own version of how this process unfolded, arriving at completely different developments and outcomes.
[name="Bernardo"]In that regard, our playwright seems to have reached an impasse.
[name="Bernardo"]That said, the contents of the first two acts are already exceptional on their own merits, so I purchased the work without hesitation.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]Mr. Bernardo, is it possible that one of the heirs of the Texas Family survived the chaos?
[name="Sora"]Like, maybe she... managed to leave Columbia and escape to a different city?
[name="Sora"]For example... Lungmen?
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Lungmen? If I recall, that's where you ladies hail from.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Apparently, Salvadore did not have a particularly amicable relationship with his son.
[name="Bernardo"]But he doted on his granddaughter, even sending her back to Siracusa, where she was fostered by Famiglia Saluzzo for several years.
[name="Bernardo"]Nobody has seen or heard from her since the liquidation, though.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#5$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]In fact, nobody can conclusively say if she was even involved in this at all. Some say she's been seen in Columbia, or even along the border of Siracusa.
[name="Bernardo"]Therefore, different accounts of Famiglia Texas's story tend to have different endings when it comes to her.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]She was said to possess their iconic black hair and orange eyes.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3")]
[name="Sora"]If—and I'm speaking hypothetically here! If the last descendant of the Texas Family is still alive, and has returned to Siracusan soil once again...
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]What would happen then?
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#8$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Certainly a thought-provoking hypothetical, one with any number of possible developments. Playwrights tend to build their work around such logic.
[name="Bernardo"]Sadly, Signorina Sora, reality does not abide by logic.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]......
[name="Sora"]Some say that she is the 'guest' of a family by the name of Bellone.
[name="Sora"]Some say that the Bellones are the most powerful family in the city.
[name="Sora"]Some say that she...
[name="Sora"]Some say that she left everything behind to go there, not even giving herself a chance to say goodbye.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#2$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]......
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]I, no, <i>we</i> came all the way here to find her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Your bravery is commendable.
[name="Bernardo"]Since you have been so frank with me, bringing secrets even I have never heard, allow me to be frank with you in turn.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#9$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Famiglia Bellone and their guests have indeed frequented this theater, graciously offering their patronage to our humble performances.

[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3")]
[name="Sora"]Really?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#8$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Call it coincidence, or call it fate. Is that not how all stories unfold?
[name="Bernardo"]If that guest truly comes to pay us a visit, then our troupe will be sure to extend her an enthusiastic welcome.
[name="Bernardo"]Rumor has it that she is a woman of few words, whose twin swords speak for her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]Her name is... Cellinia Texas.

The collapse of the Texases dealt a mortal blow to the authority of Columbia's famiglie, and they had no choice but to return to Siracusa's embrace.
They brought back Columbian technology as the price for regaining our trust. Finally, Siracusa had acquired the ability to build a new city of its own.
However, the most pressing issue quickly became who would have the rights to own it, and the power struggle within Grey Hall began the moment the plan to build the city was completed five years ago.
Today, that power struggle is finally drawing to a close.
As one of the oldest famiglie, we, the Bellones, have the opportunity to seize victory.
Volsinii's backup core is already being retrofitted to serve as the core of the new city, and new plates are steadily being built.
In a year's time, perhaps even less, it will be completed.
And your mission... is to help Famiglia Bellone turn this opportunity into a decisive victory.

[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1",name2="avg_427_vigil_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Leontuzzo"]But when the hitman's name is Texas, that might just change everything.

[name="Leontuzzo"]After the Texases were liquidated, the famiglie that had taken root in Columbia lived in constant fear of becoming the next target of Signora Sicilia's wrath.
[name="Leontuzzo"]That's when Famiglia Rossati took the initiative to approach her themselves. They were the ones who brought back the technology to develop nomadic cities.
[name="Leontuzzo"]For a brief moment, the Rossatis were poised to succeed the Texases, even managing to squeeze into one of the Twelve Seats of Grey Hall that no Texas had ever touched.

[name="Leontuzzo"]Boring, and brutal. Grey Hall has always been like that - open only to the winners.
[name="Leontuzzo"]And the boss of Famiglia Rossati stationed in this city, Signor Wallach, will not be content lapping up the scraps we Bellones leave behind.

[name="Leontuzzo"]I'll be frank with you: Volsinii has not been peaceful these last few months. A few of our friends have found themselves in various kinds of 'accidents.'
[name="Leontuzzo"]Along with them, the famiglie who still remain on the sidelines may end up changing their minds, and there's no guarantee that the famiglie that have already chosen their alliances won't betray them later.
[name="Leontuzzo"]When Signora Sicilia established Grey Hall, she laid down an ironclad rule: 'Do not kill.'
[name="Leontuzzo"]In other words, the famiglie have a lot of leeway to do whatever they want, short of killing one another.

[name="Leontuzzo"]Signorina Texas, are you aware...
[name="Leontuzzo"]...that the fall of the Texases has been adapted into one opera after another, performed across various major theaters?
[name="Leontuzzo"]In those stories, you, Cellinia Texas, are always portrayed as an ignorant child, helpless in the face of your family's collapse.
[name="Leontuzzo"]But right now, I can say for sure that you are anything but.
[name="Leontuzzo"]I truly want to know... What exactly did you experience during that 'liquidation'?

[name="Lavinia"]Right, this case is <i>certainly</i> not worth the time and energy. It's <i>only</i> five people after all.
[name="Lavinia"]The husband drives a taxi around the city. The wife picks tomatoes on a farm. They have three children, the oldest only thirteen years of age, the youngest still breastfeeding.
[name="Lavinia"]The neighbors were reluctant to say anything, and no matter who I asked, they all said that life must move on.
[name="Lavinia"]There was no screaming in the night, no crying by the lake, and no traces of blood left on their squeaky-clean floorboards.
[name="Lavinia"]Alright then. Life must move on, and they had it coming for crossing a famiglia. Or maybe their luck was so rotten they didn't even notice they were being targeted.
[name="Lavinia"]After all, the famiglie always say they would <i>never</i> attack ordinary civilians.

[name="Court Clerk"]......
[name="Court Clerk"]Your Honor, I've always had the greatest respect for you.
[name="Court Clerk"]To be honest, I have no idea what an ideal judge is supposed to look like.
[name="Court Clerk"]Even though the Signora modeled our courts after Laterano's, and codified our laws after Columbia's...
[name="Court Clerk"]None of us have ever seen a real one of Sankta's wandering judges, and Columbia's Code of Law is but an excerpt from a book.
[name="Court Clerk"]What I would rather believe is that an ideal judge should be someone as determined to uphold justice as you are.
[name="Court Clerk"]But not everyone has your talents, or your connections with Famiglia Bellone. You don't have to constantly fear for your life.

[name="Court Clerk"]Does it make a difference, as far as we're concerned?
[name="Court Clerk"]Do you still remember last month how Judge Starocci was dragged by his 'friends' to 'chat' in a car for an entire afternoon? He hasn't been able to lift his right hand since.
[name="Court Clerk"]Then there's Judge Borriello... That chubby, always-jovial old lady. How long has it been since she came to work?
[name="Court Clerk"]You're right, in theory we're supposed to represent that woman's will. But what is that even supposed to be? At least, I can't figure it out.
[name="Court Clerk"]Courage and persistence are great things to have, of course, but Judge Lavinia, please do not laugh at the wet clothes of us folks who stand beneath the eaves.
[name="Court Clerk"]After all, you have nothing to lose.
