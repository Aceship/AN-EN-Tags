Texas turns her eyes to the table by the window, upon which a necklace sits.
It was a symbol of trust from Signora Sicilia.
A gift that Giovanna left for her.
In her grandfather's eyes, the Columbian famiglie had soured.
They'd do anything for the sake of profit, getting involved in the lowest businesses, committing murders with no morals at all.
In her father's eyes, the Siracusan famiglie had decayed.
Passing up profit and opportunity, not fighting for their interests, limiting their progress for the sake of supposed morality. All of it was the pinnacle of stupidity.
In Texas's eyes, her father and grandfather were right and wrong.
If... If she is only angry about what happened to Giovanna,
then she could leave just like she did seven years ago, only this time bringing Giovanna with her.
However, when she got news of her grandfather's death, when she turned a blind eye to the carwash worker, when she turned her back on her father's orders to help, the only thought on her mind was—
There's no end to it all.

[Character]
[name="Radio"]Carracci, as bold as his vision was, never mentioned anything to me about his outlook regarding the new city.

[Character]
[name="Radio"]We've all borne witness to what he did over the past two years.
[Character]
[name="Radio"]And just when I thought he might make it long enough to see the birth of the new city, he suddenly died a few days ago.

Lavinia feels tears welling up in her eyes.
But she does not have time to wipe them, because she already has a premonition in her heart.
