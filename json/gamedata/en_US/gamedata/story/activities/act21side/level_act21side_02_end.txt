[name="???"]That the two of them were able to get together in the end is, of course, artistic license.
[name="???"]In fact, the real Salvadore did not elope with Vivienne.
[name="???"]Also, despite the fact that Vivienne's father was indeed as callous as he was wealthy, he took good care of his family - particularly Vivienne, whom he doted on like a diamond in the palm of his hand.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]Oh...
[Character(name="avg_npc_687_1#9$1")]
[name="???"]Very rarely is someone pure evil, don't you think?
[name="???"]Therefore, even if the perpetrator was someone you loved dearly, even if you were aware of your father's despicable acts, something like what he did is not so easily forgiven.
[name="???"]Signorina Vivienne ultimately chose to leave him and move to a new city, where she met someone who truly loved her and thus began a new life.
[name="???"]But, until her last breath, she never forgot the man named Salvadore.
[name="???"]So in a sense, this story can be seen as vicariously helping her dream come true.

[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#1",name2="avg_npc_687_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Caterina"]Maybe that's why her son chose a similar pathâ€” he became a wise guy, and gradually rose to become the don of a certain famiglia.
[name="Caterina"]A famiglia that would eventually go on to clash against Salvadore himself.
[name="Caterina"]Fortunately, Vivienne came forward and prevented the two rivals from becoming mortal enemies, and eventually they even became allies.
