[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#1$1")]
[name="Rubio"]But, the winner will need someone to maintain the facade of order.
[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#1$1")]
[name="Rubio"]As the don of a famiglia, surely you understand this principle—
[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#1$1")]
[name="Rubio"]It isn't impossible for the commoners to survive without the famiglie, but the same cannot be said for the famiglie without the commoners.
[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#1$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]You're telling me that you hold the real power?
[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#5$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_685_1#8$1")]
[name="Bernardo"]A good justification at that.

[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#1$1")]
[name="Rubio"]But who cares? Doesn't matter to me if you win or lose, in the end—
[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#4$1")]
