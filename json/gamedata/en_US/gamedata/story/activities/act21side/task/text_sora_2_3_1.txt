[narration(delay=1)]As the night deepens, most people slip into their dreams. But not Sora.
[narration(delay=1)]Outside, the moon glows brightly, a rare clear night sky in the rainy season. She wants to take in the sight.
[narration(delay=1)]But, she is not the only one who cannot sleep.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]Huh?
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="other")]You're awake?
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]You didn't go to sleep?
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]I couldn't fall asleep.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]Texas...
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]Tomorrow, I'm going to tell the director that if he's okay with it, I will stay in the troupe and be his hostage.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="other")]...Sora!
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]I know you'd never go along with it. And if I said this tomorrow, you'd probably start arguing with me in front of him.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]That'd make things worse.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="other")]So, you got the idea to use yourself as collateral to guarantee my safety?
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]Texas, I don't think of myself as collateral.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'm your friend.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]And I believe I can handle the consequences of my own decisions.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="other")]......
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'd prefer to negotiate on my terms, rather than let the director run the show.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]Don't worry. Lungmen showbiz isn't exactly child's play either. I can handle this!
