[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="other")]Sora, why don't you take a break? You've been going all over the place.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="other")]You don't have to go <i>that</i> far for this dress.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]I wouldn't care as much if this was just an ordinary costume dress.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]But, Texas, the director is also the boss of the Bellone Family. You should know better than me that I'm more than just an ordinary actress now.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]Sure, he acts like a kind and caring uncle to us. But, I... I'm not convinced that he won't try to use me as a bargaining chip against you.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]I have to make myself flawless to him, whether in my role as an actress, or in other waysâ€”
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="other")]I'll go with you, Sora.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]I know, I know. You won't let things get that bad.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]But I need to make preparations of my own.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]After all, I came all the way from Lungmen just to find you. You mean so much to us.
[dialog(head="npc_101_sora_1",delay=1,style="self")]I don't want to put us all in danger.
