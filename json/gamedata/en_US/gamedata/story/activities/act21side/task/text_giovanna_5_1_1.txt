[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]I think today's show was pretty good, but it doesn't hold a candle to Signorina Caterina's work.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="self")]The playwright's got some ideas, but they're kind of shallow sometimes. I get the impression the playwright thinks the new city is still controlled by you-know-who.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]You really think it isn't?
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="self")]Of course it's not! Hear me out...
[narration(delay=1)]A blonde-haired Feline quietly sits on a bench by the street. She appears somewhat pale and haggard, the pen in her hand rustling as it rubs against the paper.
[narration(delay=1)]A faint smile appears on her lips amidst the hum of the conversation.
[dialog(head="npc_687_1",delay=1,style="self")]So, do the two of you know what happens after the end?
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]I'm sure that one guy... Yeah, he figured out his issues, and used the new city to give himself a way out.
[dialog(head="npc_687_1",delay=1,style="self")]Yeah. That's exactly what happened.
[narration(delay=1)]They hear her sighing softly to herself and see the pen in her hand. With some reluctance, they approach to ask her who she is.
[dialog(head="npc_687_1",delay=1,style="self")]Who, me?
[dialog(head="npc_687_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'm just gathering some inspiration for my script. I hope I can become a professional playwright someday.
