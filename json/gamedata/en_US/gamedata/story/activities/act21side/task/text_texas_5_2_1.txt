[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]Signorina Texas, please watch your step on your way out. We've made it to the Bellone residence.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Thank you.
[narration(delay=2)]Texas prepares to push the door open.
[narration(delay=2)]But from the corner of her eye, she notices that the chauffeur has not closed the car door to wait out front as usual. Instead, he nervously dashes away, not even remembering to put his hat on.
[narration(delay=2)]Just as she hesitates, her outstretched hand resting against the door, the mafiosi to her sides immediately step up and push open the door for her.
[narration(delay=2)]A fierce explosion of light and heat erupts in front of her, the men who pushed open the door have been blasted to pieces.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=4,style="other")](*whispers*) Texas?!
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=2.5,style="self")]Still alive.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Stay down for now, and pretend to be hurt. There's going to be another group coming.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Before I came here, I saw fighting. They should've known that the Bellones and Saluzzos joined forces. The Rossatis are having some issues now too. They wanted a chance to get rid of me, but didn't have the guts.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=2,style="other")]Who betrayed us?
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]The chauffeur. He already ran. But he's not the only one, I'm sure of it.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="other")]......
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Be careful. Someone's coming.
