[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]Hello.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Oh, Your Honor, what business do you have with me?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]Excuse me, but you... are Don Agenir, aren't you?
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Hrm?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]I heard from the courthouse that Signora Sicilia showed up in court yesterday.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]When I saw you around here, I assumed you were just a Sankta living in the area. It wasn't until they brought it up that I realized, you're actually Signora Sicilia's right-hand man.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Oh, well... It's not like I was trying so hard to conceal my identity anyway.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Having that said, I didn't expect you to come looking for me.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]I thought you'd find me just as despicable as Sicilia.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]That's not how I see things.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]Regardless of my thoughts on Signora Sicilia, I've always had great respect for the man who laid the legal foundations of this country. That's you.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]So, is there something you'd like to learn from me, my child?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]I... This is kind of embarrassing, but actually, I'm not sure what I want to ask you.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]But after learning that you exist, I felt a need to talk to you.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
