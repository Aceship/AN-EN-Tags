[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]You're back.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]Lavinia, I've been thinking, there's no way for us to realize our dream with just the few of us going about our business.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]We need to do something to show the people who lived through all this that we will build a new city, and a new Siracusa.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]We can't let our dream be so detached from the common people, we can't leave it a faraway hope.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]That's the only way we'll see our ideals come to life.
