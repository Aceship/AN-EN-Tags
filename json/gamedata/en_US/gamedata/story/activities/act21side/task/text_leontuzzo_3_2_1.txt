[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]We're here.
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="other")]Alright, lemme handle this.
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=4,style="other")]Okay, he's on board. He'll see you tomorrow.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]You didn't have to do anything?
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="other")]The guy was sobbing and cradling his little pet. Besides, I would've felt bad taking a shower in somebody else's house.
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="other")]Must've been a real shock for him to find out halfway through his meal that all his guards had been replaced, top to bottom. I doubt anyone would care if the guy sitting across the table had blood on him, at that point.
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="other")]What a damned shame though. He took pretty good care of that pet.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]Since he's working with us now, we'll have to find him another one.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]He's gonna love it.
