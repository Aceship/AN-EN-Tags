[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]She's not in her usual strolling spots.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=2)]But there's nothing strange about that. There's no way she'd be in the mood for a stroll right now.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1)]Then, what am I doing looking for her here?
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1)]Am I going to tell her to stop? Explain my ideas to her? Offer some worthless condolences?
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1)]Maybe it doesn't even have anything to do with her. As the heir who's fallen out with his don, as a man who can't see through all the chaos, what should I be doing?
