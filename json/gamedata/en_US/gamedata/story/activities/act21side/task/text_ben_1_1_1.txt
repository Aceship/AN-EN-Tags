[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]If everything that unfolded in Volsinii was observed by a bystander...
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]That person would likely have a lingering suspicion.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]And that would be—who exactly am I, Benthonexigios?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Why do I keep appearing in this story, yet do nothing?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Why do I seem to know everything, yet stand on the sidelines?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]After all my talk of civilization and the wilderness, which side am I on, and why?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Well, I would first like to rid you of a misconception.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]And that is—I do not know everything.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Everything I've said has been nothing more than reasonable conjecture based on the current state of Siracusa.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]If my conjectures proved to be correct, that only means that the country of Siracusa is too predictable.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]In fact, my commentary on operatic theater is far more cogent and thought-provoking, is it not?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]So, go ahead and take a guess as to what exactly I am.
