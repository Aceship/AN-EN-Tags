[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]Texas... Would you mind telling me more about your life in Lungmen?
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]...I delivered things.
[narration(delay=1)]Texas's expression softens slightly.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]But, it couldn't have just been logistics work, right?
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Well... It sometimes gets complicated, but I really am just a delivery girl over there.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]Okay... So there are no crossbow shootouts, police chases, cops and gangs, that kind of stuff? Back when I was in school, my roommate was way into Lungmen cinema.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]You occasionally have some rubber bullets, some drag racing stunts, and... some high-quality vinyls. My friends like those kinds of things.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]And, they've also asked me the same kinds of questions. What's Siracusa like? Do they really kill people at the drop of a hat? When you go outside, do you have groups of burly men in sunglasses following you around?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=2.5,style="other")]Sounds like something some smaller famiglie might do.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]Your friends didn't come with you, did they?
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]No. I...
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]I actually don't even know how to explain all of this to them.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]When all's said and done, I need to go apologize.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[narration(delay=1)]Lavinia leans forward slightly and raises two glasses of wine from the tray in front of her.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]To your speedy return to Lungmen.
[narration(delay=1)]Texas reaches over to accept the glass of wine, revealing the corner of the poster stashed in her pocket.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]Hmm? What's that?
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Just a poster. Seemed like a pretty good joke at the time, but now that I think about it, it's just a poster.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]'La Morte di Texas'...
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]I'll help you finish the rest.
[Obtain(id="item_redwine",delay=1.5)]
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Thanks.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]Salute.
