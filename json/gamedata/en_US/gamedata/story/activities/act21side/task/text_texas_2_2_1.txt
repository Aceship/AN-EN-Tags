[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]Oh, you're the lady who saved my child! Ah, I'm delighted to see you again!
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]You're in a good mood.
[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]Haha, sure am.

[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]But this judge is different. She'll pull through for us, and because of her connections with the Bellones, the other famiglie don't dare lay a finger on her.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]Having a judge like her around means the world to us.

[narration(delay=1)]For a moment, she was worried about the judge's safety and well-being.
[narration(delay=1)]But, this worry quickly proves to be unnecessary.
