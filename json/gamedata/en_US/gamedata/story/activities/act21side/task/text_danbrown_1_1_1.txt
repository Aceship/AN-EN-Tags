[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Already done washing my car? You work pretty quick.
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]It's how I put food on the table.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Not because I'm your last customer of the day, and you want to go home soon?
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]Wanna see for yourself?

[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Hmph, unsociable fella, aren't you?
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]Have a nice day.
[narration(delay=1)]He walks to the back of the carwash and lies down on the bed.

[narration(delay=1)]He holds a knife in his hand, the blade warmed by the blood coating it. How many did he have to slash for it to reach this temperature? The question does not trouble him too much—he only wants to hold it aloft again, using it in the most straightforward manner, using it with the most gratuitous violence.
[narration(delay=1)]Now, this is Siracusa! This is what Siracusa should be!
[narration(delay=1)]He lifts his knife. His next target—
[narration(delay=4)]He suddenly sits up straight. There is nothing in his hand, only the light from the half-moon leaking from the gap between the houses outside his window, shining into his eyes.
[narration(delay=1)]He reminisces about what he saw in the dream.
