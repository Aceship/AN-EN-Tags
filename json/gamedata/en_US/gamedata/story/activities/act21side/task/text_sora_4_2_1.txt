[narration(delay=1)]The curtain call comes, and the audience bursts into applause. Sora steps out onto the stage once more, standing among her fellow actors and looking down.
[narration(delay=1)]The audience is still discussing the grand finale, with some excited viewers even shouting or asking questions.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]So! The last Texas! Doesn't really exist?!
[narration(delay=1)]Nobody responds to him, his voice is drowned out in the sea of discussion. But, Sora does give him an answer in her heart.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_684_1",delay=1)]Does Texas exist? The last Texas of a certain family, the Texas that was helpless in the face of Siracusa, the Texas that was nothing more than an illusion in the end.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_684_1",delay=1)]Of course she doesn't exist.
[narration(delay=1)]Sora looks toward the audience, and through the dazzling glow of the stage lights, she sees a familiar black-haired figure sitting below.
[narration(delay=1)]She thinks, of course no such Texas like that could exist. The only Texas who exists is the one who loves chocolate bars, falls asleep listening to her music, and will forever be her best friend.
[narration(delay=1)]This Texas, in fact, is sitting in the audience at this very moment. She's applauding, smiling gently at the girl bowing for the curtain call.
[narration(delay=1)]Exusiai and Croissant are sitting next to Texas, the two of them standing excitedly to wave at her.
[narration(delay=1)]Sora thinks to herself, this whole trip was so worth it.
