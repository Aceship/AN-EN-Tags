[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Uh... I'd like to ask a favor of you, Lavinia.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]You're still a judge, right?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Yes.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Perfect.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Back in school, I never took you seriously... My grades weren't any worse than yours, so how did you get an appointment so quickly?
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Later on, I heard them say... You're actually supported by a famiglia. A big one too. Turns out, it was the Bellones!
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]So I was thinking to myself, hah... Of course. That's the only way you could've become such a powerful judge. Hmph.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]What's your point?
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]......
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]I'm too scared.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Of what?
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]You leaned on your connections to become a judge. So I thought to myself, why couldn't I do that too?
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]But when those guys, those wise guys came up to me...
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]I was scared half to death. Barely a second passed, and I already had to give up talking to them.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]The Code of Law in my hand was just an ordinary book. Actually, it wasn't even as good as a book, considering I've knocked a cazzo in the head with a notebook before. But when I saw those wise guys, I couldn't even muster the courage to open my mouth.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Forget the whole justice thing... What the hell is that even? They're obviously criminals, but if they ever asked me to do them a favor in prison or even in court, I'd never be able to refuse.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]The backing of a famiglia... I'd be lying if I said I didn't have anyone backing me. But, it's not like that's a good thing either.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Maybe... I never should've listened to him in the first placeâ€”
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]I know... You've actually been doing things your own way. You're much braver than me, Lavinia.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Also, I heard that Bortolotti is dead, right?
[narration(delay=1)]His hand brushes against Lavinia's codex, the thorns around it pricking his fingers and leaving spots of blood behind.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]You're all much braver than me...
