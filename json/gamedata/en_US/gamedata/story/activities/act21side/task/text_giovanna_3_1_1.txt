[VoiceWithin(head="npc_687_1",delay=1)]Wallach, you already know I'm going.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_687_1",delay=1)]Cellinia... what would you do if you were donna of Famiglia Rossati?
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_687_1",delay=1)]Would you be like me, dictating what should and shouldn't be done, would you be completely hands off, or would you control everything yourself?
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_687_1",delay=1)]Or I guess... No, you'd never end up running a famiglia in the first place.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_687_1",delay=1)]But, I still have a glimmer of hope...
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_687_1",delay=1)]That if you got your hands on this thing, you'd definitely do something with it.
