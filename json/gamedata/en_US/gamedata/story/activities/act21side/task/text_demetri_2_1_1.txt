[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="self")]Don Bernardo, our men have been dispatched. But what about Leon...?
[dialog(head="npc_685_1",delay=1,style="other")]Is he still in the study?
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="self")]Yes.
[dialog(head="npc_685_1",delay=1,style="other")]I'd like to ask you, how do you feel about what he's been doing lately?
[dialog(head="npc_685_1",delay=1,style="other")]Be honest with me.
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="self")]Speaking as his soldier, I think Leontuzzo is becoming more indecisive. He's been influenced by that judge.
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="self")]I know that he has his own ideals, and is looking for efficient ways to work with the changing times. But, it's clear to me that he's going soft.
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="self")]And I'm not the only one in the famiglia who thinks like that. Though everyone will still carry out your son's orders, they're getting concerned.
[dialog(head="npc_685_1",delay=1,style="other")]Go on.
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="self")]As his friend, I can say that Leon is a good fratello, someone I'd trust to have my back.
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="self")]But, that doesn't mean what he's doing is okay.
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="self")]As our future don, he of all people should know better.
