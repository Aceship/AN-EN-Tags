[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="self")]I see you, Lavinia! Get outta that car already! We're in the middle of a barcrawl, come join us!
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="other")]You didn't even come to our class reunion. Are you really so hard to get a hold of? What've you been busy with lately?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]...I just got out of court.
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="self")]Stop pulling my leg. The courthouse isn't that way. It's the Saluzzo estate, isn't it?
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="other")]Look at you. You're the only member of our cohort who's still a practicing judge, and you don't even have kids yet.
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="other")]Things have been real crazy around the city lately, so be careful out there.
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="self")]It all makes sense to me! Get in with a well-off famiglia while you're still young, help 'em out a bit and make a fortune, then retire early and go do other things.
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="self")]Not much else we can do. What do you expect? It sure as hell beats being one of those judges missing a limb or two...
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Blurgh...
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="self")]Ugh, he's puking again. Looks like he's had a bit too much to drink.
