[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]Looks like I should've sent you to a nursing home instead of Volsinii.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Which is why I asked you to come with me, Sicilia.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Some things, you won't see until you sit down on a park bench.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]I've seen some interesting things, and figured you might want to join me.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]And there are other things you won't see until you're sitting in Grey Hall.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]I didn't come here to listen to this, Agenir.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Alright. I must say, we went a bit overboard this time.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'll admit, I was in the wrong, in certain respects.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]Hmph.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Now, it's your turn.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]You sound awfully confident about what I'm going to do next.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Otherwise, I wouldn't have come here this time either.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]Heh. Having a friend who understands you too well isn't always a good thing.
[narration(delay=1)]Signora Sicilia smiles and walks up to Agenir.
[narration(delay=1)]Then, the most exalted presence in Siracusa slowly kneels down.
[narration(delay=1)]Her expression is one of piety, like a devotee.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]To whom are you praying for forgiveness?
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]To guns and order.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]What is your sin?
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]I accepted the challenge of a young man.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]And his goal is to destroy everything I've built.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Do you see this as a betrayal of guns and order?
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]I do.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Then why didn't you nip it in the bud?
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]Bernardo's methods went outside the rules, and I could not tolerate them. But Leontuzzo chose to sit in front of me, risking his own life to offer his ideas.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]I decided to give him a chance.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]No, that's not the real reason.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]...I told him, Siracusa will be resplendent while I live, but wither away after I die.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Do you not believe that the guns and order you created can live on?
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]I've learned one thing from the many heirs I've tried to cultivate: the next Signora Sicilia won't be born in an era of peace.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]When I decided to make all the famiglie bow before me, the only things on my mind were ambition and passion.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]And over all the years I've managed this country, I can't help but feel somewhat sentimental for this one word: Siracusa.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]I will do everything in my power to crush him.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]But, if he really does succeed in the end...
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]Then so be it.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]On behalf of guns and order, your transgressions will be forgiven.
[narration(delay=1)]Signora Sicilia stands up slowly, her expression returns to normal, as if everything that just happened had nothing to do with her.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]How long has it been since the last time you confessed to me like that?
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]I forget.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]How'd it feel?
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]I feel even worse.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]It's not easy to be honest with yourself.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]Agenir... do you think you've failed?
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]What about you? Do you think you've succeeded?
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]When I think about that question, I realize we should really be asking what counts as success, and how long we have to hold up this country for it to count as a success.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Maybe we've only succeeded once we have every famiglia seated at the same table.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]In other words, the Siracusa we've built is not a success?
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Who knows? Sometimes, just making fewer mistakes than others already counts as a success.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]If that's true, I've definitely made fewer mistakes than most.
[dialog(head="npc_691_1",delay=1,style="other")]After all, my mirror is still here, is he not?
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Hah, you've got terrible taste in people.
