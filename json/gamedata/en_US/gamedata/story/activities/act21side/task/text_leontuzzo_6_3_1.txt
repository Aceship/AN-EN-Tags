[narration(delay=1)]The park has fallen still and silent, only a few residents are enjoying their leisure time in the distance. As they come and go, Leontuzzo sees a figure he recognizes.
[narration(delay=1)]He subconsciously loses his breath for a moment. He still remembers their conversation in Grey Hall.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1)]Signora Sicilia?
[narration(delay=1)]He sits up straight, but the figure has already disappeared.

[narration(delay=1)]Had Signora Sicilia really come, he knows that even if he were to meet with her, she would offer him nothing more than 'condolences.'
[narration(delay=1)]But he knows what everyone is striving towards, and he knows what he should do.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]A trial.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]A trial for him, a trial for all to see.
