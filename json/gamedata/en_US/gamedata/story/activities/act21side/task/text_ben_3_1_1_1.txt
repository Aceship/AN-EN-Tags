[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]I left it at the entrance to that prison.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]But your case looked empty.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Unfortunate. That was the one thing I didn't want you finding out.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]Why do you carry it with you?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]It's a physical manifestation of my contradictions. The suitcase was a gift from my mother when I got into university.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I don't have any ties to my family anymore, but I still carry this suitcase with me at all times.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]Everything I am was taught to me by Agnese. She asked me not to forget her.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]Agnese would hate you.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]That's not necessarily true.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]But in any case, Lunacub, thank you.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I suppose this is where we should part ways. I think we won't see each other again for a very long time.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]Do you really have to live here?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I do. As for you, I think you've already figured out what comes next, yes?
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]...I will come see you.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Some may interpret this as a farewell scene, of the younger generation sending the older to prison.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Go, Lunacub. Best of luck on your hunt.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]I hope... I hope you...
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Just hope that life overcomes me sooner rather than later.
