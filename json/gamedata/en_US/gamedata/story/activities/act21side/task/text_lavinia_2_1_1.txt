[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Excuse me. I'm here to retrieve some files. Here's my permit.
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="other")]Sure, it's in the archives in the back. I'll take you, just sign your name when you find what you need.
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="other")]Huh...? One moment please, Signorina Lavinia.
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="other")]Were you getting ready for a trial? When these files were archived yesterday, they said that the prisoner in question had been released early.
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="other")]You're only allowed to borrow these files for the time being.
[Obtain(id="item_borrow",delay=1.5)]
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Nobody informed me... Which judge authorized the prisoner's release?
