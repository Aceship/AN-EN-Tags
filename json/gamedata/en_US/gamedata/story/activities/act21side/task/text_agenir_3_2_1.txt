[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]This is... the Code of Law?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]And, a first edition too?!
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]That's right. It's for you, my child.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]This... is priceless beyond measure.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]The path you've chosen is completely opposite to mine.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]But, I'm not as hard on our youth as Sicilia is, so please treat this as a little present from me.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]I actually don't think that's true.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Oh?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]I don't think our paths head in opposite directions.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]The reason it was difficult to walk the path of a judge had nothing to do with the law itself, only the power of the famiglie to largely render it irrelevant.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]To be honest, if I was able to handle every case to the letter of the law, I don't think I would be where I am today.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]Every judge believes that you, the man who wrote this code, know full well what justice is.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]The institution of guns and order should have also been the institution of the law, but instead, it became a convention among famiglie.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]And this is the biggest misunderstanding you have about me, my child.
[dialog(head="npc_692_2",delay=1,style="self")]Guns beget power, and order begets regularity. What I sought was never justice, but efficacy.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]Then, I will prove to you that the law can replace the customs of the famiglie.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]My child, are you going to challenge me, just as Leontuzzo challenged Sicilia?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="other")]That's right.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Haha, in that case... We'll just have to wait and see.
