[narration(delay=1)]Texas gingerly runs her fingers across the small box, suddenly feeling a wave of remorse.
[narration(delay=1)]She should've been the one to buy the gift.
[narration(delay=1)]She was the one who made her friends worry, who got them involved in this mess. But instead, it is their kindness that she now holds in her hands.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'm sorry, Sora.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[dialog(head="npc_684_1",delay=1,style="other")]As long as you get it.
[dialog(head="npc_684_1",delay=2.5,style="other")]Just kidding!
[dialog(head="npc_684_1",delay=1,style="other")]What's with the stony expression? Let's head back to our place!
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Alright.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Sora! Be careful on your way back. I'll be over soon.
[dialog(head="npc_684_1",delay=1,style="other")]Got it!
