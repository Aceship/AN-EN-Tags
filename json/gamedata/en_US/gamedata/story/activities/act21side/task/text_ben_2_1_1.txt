[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'm willing to wager, the opera was not originally intended to end this way.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]From the beginning, the show drummed up an atmosphere of heroism, trying to wrap Texas in a layer of pathos.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Without a doubt, Giovanna's own emotions have been woven into this script.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]But that being the case, it would be impossible for Cellinia to have exited the story in such a fashion in the original script.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]By the looks of things, something clicked for Giovanna over the course of this business.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Not bad. It elevates this play from an exemplary yet commonplace work into a true masterpiece.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Did you enjoy it, Lunacub?
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]I didn't get it.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Of course you didn't. That's the reason I brought you here.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]Huh?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Agnese must have already been prepared to let you, a girl born in the wildness, set foot in the city.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]Prepared?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Prepared for you to no longer be you.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]But, I am still me.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]As far as I'm aware, the remaining Fangs are all dependent on certain institutions. In other words, if you want to find them, you must adapt to the rules of civilization.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]You won't get as lucky every time as you did with Bernardo.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]If I get used to civilization, will I stop being me?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]You'll have to acquire a large number of skills that you do not need.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]Why does that matter to you?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]It doesn't. The fact we even met in the first place was coincidence.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I just want to let you know that you still have a choice.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]What choice?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]To see civilization as just another wildness.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]To see high-rises and skyscrapers as nothing more than giant, towering trees.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]To see the incessant flow of cars as nothing more than the stampeding of wild beasts.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]To see deception and conspiracy as nothing more than another hunting technique.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]Will that change anything?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]When you find yourself needing to clarify your own views on civilization, you'll know.
