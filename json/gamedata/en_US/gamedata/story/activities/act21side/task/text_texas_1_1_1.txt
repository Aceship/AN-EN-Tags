[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Hurry up! The fighting's started! You, over there, if you're not gonna run, at least get outta the way!
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1)]This place hasn't changed one bit.
[narration(delay=1)]The bystanders disperse in a panic, but Texas remains seated at the table, looking at the pizza that was just brought out to her.
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]That woman over there. Don't forget to take care of her too.
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="self")]Didn't you say killing civilians is too messy?
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]Doesn't count if they're askin' to die.
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=3,style="self")]What the hell's going on? How's she this strong?!
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]Gah. Just get the job done first and worry about her later!
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1)]The food's totally ruined now.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1)]Somebody hidin' under the bar? Looks like the shopkeeper's kid.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1)]No loose ends.
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=2,style="self")]Wanna go back for her?
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]Wait, hold off on that for now. I didn't get a good look before, but the color of her hair and eyes... We'd better figure out who she is.
