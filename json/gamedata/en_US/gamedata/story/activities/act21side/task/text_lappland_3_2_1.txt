[narration(delay=1)]The smoke from the burning photo flushes out a gray-and-white striped musbeast from the grass.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Oh, there's another little fella here.
[narration(delay=1)]Lappland lifts it by the back of its neck and looks at the panicked beastling with its feet dangling in the air.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Haha, you scared? How about that feeling of being airborne?
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Getting carried around by the scruff of your neck, losing control of your body. Nobody likes that, right?
[narration(delay=1)]As if to prove her words, the musbeast opens its mouth to try to bite Lappland's finger.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Yes, yes! Just like that! All you can do is fight back, right?
[narration(delay=1)]She lets the musbeast rest in the palm of her hand.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Did you know, I once kept a buddy who looked just like you.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]I got it the cutest little cage, the finest food, and even fluffy sawdust to nap on.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]I would even dress it up nice and pretty. But...
[narration(delay=1)]The musbeast cannot understand human language. It simply sniffs around Lappland's hand.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]The more I look at you, the more I see the resemblance.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]How about you come home with me then?
[narration(delay=1)]She throws the rest of the photos into the fire, the tongues of flame rolling over the already-blurred faces.
