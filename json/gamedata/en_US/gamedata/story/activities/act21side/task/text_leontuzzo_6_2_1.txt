[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Ah, umm... Sure. Sorry, b-but we'd better get going...

[narration(delay=1)]Leontuzzo opens his mouth, but can't get out the words he wanted to say.
[narration(delay=1)]He comes to a realization.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1)]I don't think my father's vision will come to pass.

[VoiceWithin(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1)]And so, I have to make them realize, and then accept, my visionâ€”a city without famiglie.
