[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]A suicide victim.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I assume none of you can say with certainty why this answer was chosen.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]That's understandable. It's the position I've taken myself.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]That's what I want them to call me, and nothing else.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Some may wonder why a self-proclaimed suicidal person is walking around grandiosely, like he's living life to its fullest.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]And my answer to that isâ€”I think I'm bad.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Neither my existence nor my thoughts are of any benefit. I look at everything from an excessively sober perspective.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'm not willing to cheer on those who are struggling, nor willing to wave the flag around for their oppressors.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]To use an analogy, I like sitting in a pizza parlor and sipping red wine. But I'm no friend to pizza or wine. In fact, I look upon them both with derision.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]My attitude to life is the same.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I want to commit suicide, but I think it'd be too shameful to do it myself. So I'm waiting for life itself to take the initiative to overcome me, knowing full well that I will die by suicide in the future.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]That's right, ladies and gentlemen. Before you stands one who is both contradictory and unified.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]These contradictions used to trouble me, but now, they keep me going.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]They drive me to keep asking, doubting, thinking, and laughing.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]You've been talking a whole lot of nonsense for a while now...
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Just a hobby of mine in my spare time.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Self-awareness is very important, Lunacub.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]I know who I am, and what I need to do.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]But soon, you won't know either.
