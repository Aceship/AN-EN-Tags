[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Are you busy moving right now?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Yes, I'll be living in the new city.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Let me help you then. Oh, before that, there's something I wanted to give you!
[narration(delay=1)]He takes out a neatly-written resume.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]My CV. I've decided that after I graduate, I want to work with you.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Working hard for the sake of the new city that you talked about was the reason I went to law school in the first place.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]And those flowers...
[narration(delay=1)]He looks at the bouquet of withered flowers among her luggage. On it is a tag with words of thanks written by a citizen.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Lavinia, I'm gonna get flowers from the people, just like you.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Once you have, I'll accept your application. How does that sound?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Though, I do want to reiterate—are you sure about this? If you decide to work with me, it'll be a lot more difficult than if you decided to stay in Volsinii.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]...I can't even say for sure what it is I should be doing next.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]This is not an easy path to tread.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]I know, I've already made up my mind.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'm... very glad to hear that.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]All your stuff is packed. Are you ready to leave?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Yes... Actually, before that, I need to go mourn someone's passing.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Oh, I guess I'll leave you to it then.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Actually, I'd like you to come with me.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]He's not just an old friend. You could say that he was an old friend to this entire city.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'm sure you can already guess who I'm talking about—the new Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici who died during his inaugural speech.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]When he left us, there was still so much uncertainty in the air. But now that things are winding down, I should go and see him again.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]That gentleman... Why did he...?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]He made up his mind.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]To some people, there's nothing worth paying the ultimate price for, let alone a future so distant and uncertain.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=2,style="self")]But I've been thinking—the greater the turmoil, the more worthwhile the determination. He may have been alone when he left us, but he's not the only man to walk that path.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=2,style="self")]I'm sure he'll be glad to see you when we get there.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]But at the same time, it still upsets me. I'm upset with myself.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]If the awakening of a new group can't be inspired without the lives of those who led the way, I myself must not have been conscious enough.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]I used to resent Leon—he didn't even notice the corpses along the streets until they personally affected him as part of the Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici. But how am I any different? I didn't wake up until a man I respected paid the ultimate price.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=2.5,style="other")]I wouldn't say that, Lavinia. Even now, many people are still reluctant to take that step.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=2,style="other")]After all, I'm the only man who came today. There are still many more watching and waiting, and I can only say from my own position that I made the right decision.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=2,style="other")]But who knows how things will look in a decade or a century? Maybe we'll be hailed as heroes. Maybe we'll be mocked. More likely, we won't be remembered at all.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=2,style="other")]Everyone wants to live in the present. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=2,style="other")]But, Lavinia, there is one last thing I want to say.
[narration(delay=1)]The young man suddenly turns serious.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=2,style="other")]Leontuzzo Bellone. I still can't trust a wise guy like him, even when he says he's given up his famiglia.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]After all, the two of us come from completely different walks of life. If anything ever comes up, I'll stand on your side.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]...What?
