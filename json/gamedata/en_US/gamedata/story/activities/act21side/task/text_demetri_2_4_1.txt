[narration(delay=1)]At a park, Demetri slouches into a long bench.
[narration(delay=1)]It's the first time he's had a moment's rest in the last few days.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]Leon, the other day, I was thinking about the stuff you said to me.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]Maybe... that wasn't so unfeasible after all.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]If we were in any other famiglia besides Bellone, your hands might've actually been completely tied.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]Haha... Now, what will become of this famiglia in Siracusa?
[dialog(head="npc_690_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]Leon, it's not that I can't understand your ideas.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]Even I can envision the future you're talking about.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]But, it's not a reality yet, right? Until it is, it's just a figment of your imagination.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]The work we have to do right now is down-to-earth.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]What you should concern yourself with right now is being the famiglia's heir.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]If you're serious about this...
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_690_1",delay=1)]I'll tell the Don what I'm thinking.
