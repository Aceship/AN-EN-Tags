[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]Signor Ministro, I wanted to talk about your thing.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'm thinking it's something you'd wanna take care of quickly. Wouldn't want it plastered all over tomorrow's tabloids. In a few days, it might even get adapted into a burlesco.
[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]......
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]I really don't want to lean on the old ways here. All I need is an agreement that you'll return the favor when the time is right.
[narration(delay=1)]His lips curl with the faint joy of a persuaded man, but he quickly suppresses it with the proper expression of one being threatened.
[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]...I have no idea what you're talking about.
[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]Please don't bother me again, especially not in public.
