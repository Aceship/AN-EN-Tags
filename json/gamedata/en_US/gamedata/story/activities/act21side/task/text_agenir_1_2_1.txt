[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]Care for a drink?
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'll pass.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]How dull.
[narration(delay=1)]Agenir sits down next to Ben, picks up the bottle, and takes a swig not at all congruous with his appearance.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]I thought you were just going to sleep in the courthouse until this was all over.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]I thought you were going to side with the young wolf, Leontuzzo.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]At least in name, I am still one of Sicilia's 'Bocca al Lupo,' am I not?
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]I didn't expect you to finally embrace that title.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]After all, I'm a man of contradictions. I'm not too ready to acknowledge the glory of civilization, but I'm not after a pointless death either.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]Although, you've got just as many contradictions.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]You set the rules that have governed Siracusa for the past few decades, but unlike Sicilia, you never insisted you were right.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]I only trust that I'm not wrong either.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]Who knows?
[narration(delay=1)]Ben declines to say anything more, only taking a deep swig of the bottle of wine in his hand.
