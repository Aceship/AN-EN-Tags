[dialog(head="npc_686_1",delay=1,style="other")]Go. Don't disappoint me.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Arrivederci, padre mio.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]And buongiorno, buon pomeriggio, and buona notte.
[narration(delay=1)]With that, Lappland takes a step back, salutes her seated father overly-respectfully, turns around, and walks out of the room.
[narration(delay=1)]Several of the mafiosi in the hall breathe a sigh of relief.
[narration(delay=1)]One man steps forward and stands behind Alberto.
[dialog(head="npc_686_1",delay=1,style="other")]Capisce?
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]Capisco.
[dialog(head="npc_686_1",delay=1,style="other")]Go then.
[narration(delay=1)]The figure follows Lappland, also disappearing down the hall.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=5,style="self")]Let me tell you again why I'm here. I've got a debt to collect for a certain someone.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]You've paid off the principal. Now comes the interest.
[narration(delay=1)]The dull thud of bodies falling to the ground echoes through the room.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]*yawn*...
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=2.5,style="other")]She killed our contact?
[narration(delay=1)]He's in no hurry to head back to report his mistake. Caution told him to stay in position and continue observing, and he dared not approach to inspect the body until long after Lappland left.
[narration(delay=1)]But, he quickly realizes another problemâ€”the body is still alive.
[narration(delay=1)]And opens his eyes.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]You really took the bait after all.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Alberto sent somebody to keep tabs on me, huh?
[narration(delay=1)]Lappland picks up the weapon at her feet and squints at the man in front of her.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Say, what's your favorite dessert?
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=3,style="other")]Who is that...?
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=3,style="other")]...Signorina Lappland?
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=3,style="other")]That's right, there's no mistaking her...
[narration(delay=1)]The carwash worker puts down the bottle of wine in his hand and looks at the shadow of his knife beneath the moonlight.
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=3,style="other")]Fun, fun...
[narration(delay=1)]He passes out between the bottles.
