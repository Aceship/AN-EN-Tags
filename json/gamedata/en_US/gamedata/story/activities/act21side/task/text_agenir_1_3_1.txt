[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]What are you going to do next?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]Pretty much the same as always. I'll go wherever the good shows are.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]How about you, old man?
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Me?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]Let me ask you a question.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]Here you are today, sitting around helplessly watching the times change.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]But what about the past, when you left Laterano with Sicilia, when you set the laws of this land into stone? How did you feel then?
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]I felt a torrent of emotions.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]Time is a flat circle.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]I've already told you this several times.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]I never liked your rules, but that doesn't mean I'll like the new ones either.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]A false civilization naturally pales before a civilization that comes from the heart.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]However, what comes from the heart is invariably as short-lived as it is brilliant.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]Sicilia is stubborn. She will take her society with her to the grave.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]But what about you?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]What you wanted wasn't an ironclad order, you just wanted to prove that 'laws' can be created. Isn't that right?
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]Yes. I've always been curious as to what exactly allows the Sankta to coexist on terms of absolute equality.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]And she craved the power to allow all the famiglie to negotiate at the same table.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]That's why we chose to join forces.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]But, the moment 'guns and order' was brought into being, your goal of leaving Laterano had already been accomplished.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]What kept you in this country decades after that was not her society itself, but the promise you made to her.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]You've been around long enough, old man.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]What, you're not going to leave, but you're going to try to persuade me to go?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="other")]I'm just concerned that your eyesight will get so bad you won't be able to see the road ahead of you.
[dialog(head="npc_692_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
