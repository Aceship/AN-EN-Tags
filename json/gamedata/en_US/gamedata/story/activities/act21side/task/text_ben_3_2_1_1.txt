[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]You could've just told me that I shouldn't be sleeping in the park.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]But in the end, didn't you also find a hole under a bridge?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]What I taught you was the rules.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]And I couldn't care less about the rules.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]Then, why do you want me to follow the rules?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Because you can't break the rules until you know what they are.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]But in any case, Lunacub, thank you.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I suppose this is where we should part ways. I think we won't see each other again for a very long time.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]Do you really have to live here?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I do. As for you, I think you've already figured out what comes next, yes?
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]...I will come see you.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Some may interpret this as a farewell scene, of the younger generation sending the older to prison.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Go, Lunacub. Best of luck on your hunt.
[dialog(head="npc_4014_lunacu_1",delay=1,style="other")]I hope... I hope you...
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Just hope that life overcomes me sooner rather than later.
