[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]After coming to understand who I am, the audience may want to ask if I hold the same attitude toward Leontuzzo and Sicilia.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]My answer to this is, undoubtedly, yes.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]As members of the human population, we are required to celebrate everything that we have created. Otherwise, we would be denying our history.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]To avoid Catastrophes, we constructed nomadic cities.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]To better our lives, our technology advances with each passing day.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]To better become a collective, we iterate upon our societal structure and methods of managing it.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]As members of the human collective, we accept that all this is to be appreciated.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Subconsciously, we come to believe that we are worthy of better, more humane, more orderly, more equal lives.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]One might even plausibly conclude that a vast majority of conflicts in the world are not collisions between justice and evil.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]But rather, from my good being better than your good.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]However, is that truly the case?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]How far have we stepped from the wastes? How far apart are we from the beasts?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]In which direction are we headed?
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]The wheels of history push us forward without leaving any time for contemplation.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]But, beneath all of that, as a human—
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]I must believe that the emotions I feel at any given moment are genuine, and come from the heart.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Therefore, Rubio, Danbrown, Leontuzzo, Lavinia, and even Sicilia at the moment she decided to unite the famiglie—
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Though their motives and objectives are all different, they deserve my admiration all the same.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Of course, none of that has anything to do with why I showed up in prison.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]And now, I must make an addendum to the question of my identity.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]My primary source of income is writing for art publications, which obviously leaves much to be desired financially.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]And as we speak, the privilege of living in the new city is being bought up rapidly. Naturally, this is of no concern to me.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]However, be it from an artistic standpoint or in consideration of what is to come, moving to Nuova Volsinii is a much better option.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]So, I'm currently exploring my options.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]For example—becoming an inmate in Nuova Volsinii.
[dialog(head="npc_694_1",delay=1,style="self")]Hopefully Signorina Lunacub helped me put my suitcase in the right place.
