[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Bring the wine! This is barely anything, and you aren't bringing out more yet?
[narration(delay=1)]There is a knock at the door, brief and gentle. The waiter outside will not step into the box without permission.
[narration(delay=1)]'Excuse me, signori... I apologize for interrupting, but...'
[narration(delay=1)]'We would be honored if you could please allow the patrons downstairs to quietly enjoy the show...'
[narration(delay=1)]The carwash worker looks over at the door to the box which has been opened just a crack, and walks over.
