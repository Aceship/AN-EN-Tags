[narration(delay=1)]A banquet, not particularly grandiose.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]Signor Ministro, we could take care of this, easy. And it'd be awful nice if I didn't need to lean on the old ways of getting you to pay me back.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]We'll cover some of the expenses, and use our connections in the government to handle this for you. In return, someday, and that day may never come, we will call upon you to do a service for us.
[narration(delay=1)]The man sitting across the table is in no hurry to speak, swirling the wine around his glass.
[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]......
[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]If I make this deal with you, the public servants who currently show me great respect might change their minds about me.
[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]Their respect hinges on me acting without self-interest.
[dialog(head="npc_177",delay=1,style="other")]My reputation is very important to me.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]That's... unfortunate, Signor Ministro.
[dialog(head="npc_427_vigil_1",delay=1,style="self")]It saddens me that we can't see eye-to-eye.
