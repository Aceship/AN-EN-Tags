[VoiceWithin(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1)]The individual in question is an associate of Famiglia Bellone. I still remember him.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1)]Right now, they probably need all the manpower they can get.
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1)]Or, there's some other calculus involved, and if he's convicted, it'll create problems for the famiglia.

[VoiceWithin(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1)]He told me before that I would finally realize true justice in Siracusa.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[VoiceWithin(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1)]But how long must I endure this kind of injustice?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]Here, I'm done looking. Thanks in advance for having to re-archive them.
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="other")]Right.
[dialog(head="npc_697_1",delay=1,style="other")]Hmm? You're not going to ask for a retrial?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]No... Not right now.
