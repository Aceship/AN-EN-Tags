[narration(delay=1)]Capone is a little nervous. He does not know what Lappland plans to do.
[narration(delay=1)]Based on his past experiences, he assumes that he might fall to a single swing of her sword, or he might suffer some ridicule or anger from the woman in front of him.
[narration(delay=1)]But today, she simply strides forward with brisk steps, heading in the direction of the new city, step by step.
[narration(delay=1)]He starts to envy Gambino, who left one step sooner.
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]Where are you going?
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]I'll see you off.
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]......
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]I'm not following you anymore.
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]Lappland, Gambino and me decided we got nothin' to do with you no more.
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]You keep goin' your own way. I got other places to be.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]...Okay.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]I didn't say anything, did I?
[narration(delay=1)]Capone grips the knife hidden in his sleeves.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]I just came to give you my blessing—
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]You're running away too. I guess I could say you're rebelling. Rebelling against me.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Even if you decide to keep getting pushed around in the streets of Siracusa, well, that's not so bad, is it?
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]So put the knife away. I just came to say goodbye.
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]......
[narration(delay=1)]He continues to clutch the blade in his hand.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Still don't get it, little buddy? I'm not here to laugh at what you're doing, and I'm not angry at all.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]You're just following your path.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Arrivederci.
[narration(delay=1)]Capone remains silent for a long time.
[narration(delay=1)]Finally, he turns and leaves.
[narration(delay=2.5)]Lappland turns once more, walking in the opposite direction of Volsinii—toward the wildness.
[narration(delay=1)]A black mist condenses behind her.
