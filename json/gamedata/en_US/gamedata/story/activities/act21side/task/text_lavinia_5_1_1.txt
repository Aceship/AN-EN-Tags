[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]Are you... Signorina Lavinia?
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]I am. And you are...?
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]I'm your underclassman! I heard the speech you gave at school, and... actually, I didn't take you seriously at the time.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]I just thought it was another woman coming by to talk a big game.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]But with everything going on lately, I've been looking into some things myself, and the court bailiffs told me everything you did. Now I believe what said in that speech came from your heart.
[dialog(head="npc_4065_judge_1",delay=1,style="self")]I appreciate you going out of your way to tell me that.
[dialog(head="npc_696_1",delay=1,style="other")]No, I'm the one who should be thanking you! I've already figured out what I'm supposed to be doing next!
