[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Go ahead and ask.
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]Are you really the last Texas?
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]Are you really the murderer?
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]Judge Lavinia was the one who arrested you, but if I recall correctly, you came here with the Bellone boy. Did they have a falling-out of some sort?
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]......
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]Not answering, huh...? Let's try something else.
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]*sigh*... There's so much commotion out there, but it's deathly quiet in here.
[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]If Judge Lavinia didn't close this trial, there'd be more spectators squeezed outside that door next to you than at the box office for a new opera.

[dialog(head="npc_698_1",delay=1,style="other")]Not talking again, huh?
[narration(delay=1)]Texas notices water dripping from the corners of the wall due to the humidity of the rainy season. Her own clothes have even gotten wet.
[narration(delay=1)]A minor discomfort such as this normally would not bother her at all, but right now, the sensation makes her skin crawl with disgust.
[narration(delay=1)]The people here don't care about who died, or why. They only care about a name, an identity. A name that fills them with exhilaration.
[narration(delay=1)]Texas leans against the corner, her eyelids weighed down by her exhaustion.
