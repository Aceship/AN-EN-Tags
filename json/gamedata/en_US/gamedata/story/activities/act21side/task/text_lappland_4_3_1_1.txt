[narration(delay=1)]In it is a silver-haired girl about ten years of age, dressed meticulously in Saluzzo attire, a serious and stoic expression chiseled into her face.
[narration(delay=1)]The girl's eyes are not looking at the camera, but rather at its sideâ€”
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Carissimo padre mio.
[narration(delay=1)]She presses the photo to her chest, whispering to herself as if in a dream.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Ever since I was little, as the heir to Famiglia Saluzzo, I was taught how to behave, how to speak, and how to talk to the wise guys to command more authority.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]At that time, I didn't realize you were more than just my father, you were Don Saluzzo.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]I thought I would be free if I rebelled against you, but I came to realize you were also controlled by the famiglia.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Ah, spiacente. Controlled? You wouldn't see it that way.
[narration(delay=1)]She tears the photograph into little pieces, until only her young, naive face remains.
[narration(delay=1)]She looks into her own eyes.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Of course you think that's how things should be. That's what a don should be. Of course his daughter is not just his daughter, she's also the future donna.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Haha, don't I look just like a fragile little fowlbeast forced to lug around sharpened claws?
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]I really did love that gift, father.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]I cherished it more than words can express.
[narration(delay=1)]She tosses the shreds of paper into the pit like confetti.
[narration(delay=1)]A small, charred musbeast is already lying in there.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]And in the end, you still died, this still won't burn, and I still have no hope of escape.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]I cherished you so much. But, you died at the hands of carissimo padre mio, yet again.
[narration(delay=1)]Those eyes seem to peer up at her from within the flames.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]...Ahaha!
