[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]Why are you so scared to come in? Why are you talking to me from out there?
[narration(delay=1)]Nobody answers.
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]Just because I'm some random guy who happened to buy a ticket and book a seat in this high-class box?
[narration(delay=1)]On stage, the duel is about to come to an end, and applause bursts from the audience below.
[narration(delay=1)]None of the audience sitting in the rows below are complaining about the noise from above.
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]Ah... I get it.
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]Because I'm sitting here above the stage, none of you dare to challenge me.
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]Even if I am still 'me.' But, I'm not me anymore.
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]*hic*... Hahaha!
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]This is how you all are!
[narration(delay=1)]The friend sitting behind him does not lift his eyes to watch the performance on the stage, nor does he care about the mumbling of the carwash worker standing at the door.
[narration(delay=1)]He simply continues to knock down glass after glass of fine wine poured by the attendant next to him.
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]I get it now.
[dialog(head="npc_693_1",delay=1,style="self")]Here, the key to the box. I'm gonna head out, so make sure you take good care of him.
