[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Sora?
[narration(delay=1)]No response. Only a rustling from the darkness.
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]...Sora?!
[narration(delay=1)]She takes a sharp stride forwardâ€”
[dialog(head="npc_684_1",delay=1,style="other")]Huh? Texas! What are you doing here?
[narration(delay=1)]At the entrance to a small shop along the street, Sora is humming a tune beneath the lights, an intricate little box resting in her hand.
[dialog(head="npc_684_1",delay=1,style="other")]What's that you've got there? A radio?
[dialog(head="npc_1028_texas2_1",delay=1,style="self")]Yep. But, it's useless now, so I'm throwing it away.
[dialog(head="npc_684_1",delay=1,style="other")]We still could use a radio for our hideout. I think Croissant might like it.
