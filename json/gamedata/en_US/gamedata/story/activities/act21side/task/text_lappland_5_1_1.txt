[narration(delay=1)]After leaving Grey Hall, Lappland would not be seen again.
[narration(delay=1)]Just as she is about to leave Volsinii, she remembers some unfinished business.
[narration(delay=1)]And so, she turns back once more.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]...I just can't bear to part with you guys, huh?
[narration(delay=1)]Gambino waves his hand, and turns to leave without saying anything.
[narration(delay=1)]Capone stands there motionless, and after a long time, finally takes a step forward.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]You're still playin' around, holding a knife at my neck like that?
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]What're you doin' here? I thought you left.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Gambino's gone?
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]Yeah. Said he was gonna work his way up some famiglia.
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]Before you say anything... lemme tell you this.
[narration(delay=1)]Capone looks at the woman in front of him vacantly, unsure of what might happen to him when he finishes his words.
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]Just like you said, I ain't gonna find no answers from you, no way forward.
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]I'm leavin' too.
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Oh.
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]...'Oh?'
[dialog(head="npc_541_1",delay=1,style="other")]That's it?
[dialog(head="npc_683_1",delay=1,style="self")]Addio, Capone.
