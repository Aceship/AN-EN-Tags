It is a photograph from many years ago.
Sora can barely make out the background that should be of the wide and bustling streets of Columbia past.
In the center of the photograph stands a middle-aged man who wears a kind expression, but exudes an audacity not to be trifled with.
On his left and right sides stand a Lupo girl, and a Feline girl.
The girl on the left has beautiful blonde hair and sports a cheery expression, and even at a glance, one can immediately tell that she has a bubbly personality.
The girl on the right has black hair, her face betraying no emotions, making it difficult for one to guess the contents of her heart.

For a brief moment, Texas shifts her eyes to one of the boxes.
She knows Bernardo is sitting there, gazing down upon everything.
She feels it in her heart.
Whether coincidence or some form of necessity, in this moment, Sora is both a danger and a safe haven.
Everything depends on her.
The movement in the auditorium and the faint sounds in the distance all prelude the start of the assassination.
She gestures to Sora for her to stay silent, then proceeds to pluck the strings in her hands.
A most wonderful performance has begun.
