[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Your next opponent has been duly decided.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  No reason to come in person for this.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  True, but I do prefer to handle things personally. It is the only way I ensure I have an exact grasp on all manner of matters that may arise in the workflow... Of course, there’s a selfish element as well.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  I can hardly contain my curiosity regarding the sister of the Radiant Knight Margaret Nearl. The young knight who’s all the rage.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  There are many seeded players, hopefuls for the Major, who have hardly the popularity to match up to you, Miss Maria. It is a strength you bear as a competition knight, an advantage. 
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  I hope to see you make appropriate use of this advantage. Of course, I also possess many... high-grade business contracts.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  When compared to any of those sponsors who sought you out in private, I can guarantee that these are all corporate and Knightclub affiliations beyond your imagination...
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_120#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  Hear, hear! You’ve taken all the glory out of knighthood. It’s profane! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_106")]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Glory? Ah... right, glory. 
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  The campaign knights garrisoned the frontier fortresses at dawn, and competitors of every standing brought value regardless to Kazimierz—
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Glory, where is glory? Has it vanished? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#3")]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  No.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  No-one can excise glory from Kazimierz. Not even if the hundreds of thousands of Kazimierz companies, big and small, were to join forces as one.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  So have knights been reduced to tools of war, eyes blinded by profit? Have knights abandoned glory themselves, forgotten their pasts? 
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  No and no. To say that is to look down on the knights. No director would dare entertain the lie that knights have become marionettes. For what reason would the flourishing of the competition knights bring us sorrow?
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=10, ystrength=12, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Old Knight"]  *Spit*! Who are you to talk about glory? 
[name="Old Knight"]  Kazimierz can’t even remember what the past—
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  —Past glory, the spirit of knighthood, ah—the great transcendental soul! The sun that beamed in history’s hollows! 
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Do I have that right? But neither spectator nor tourist need spirit, and it’s hardly necessary for us to make a show of it for them. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#3", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  Slippery little... I could tear your face off right now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#3", name2="avg_npc_106#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Ah, let’s not be so hasty. Glory, yes, what a wonderful thing, what an impeccable thing, and still it exists upon every knight family’s crest— 
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#3", name2="avg_npc_106#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  —But, most unfortunately, the Kazimierz people no longer need it.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  It has not been abandoned, nor drowned beneath. It has always been here. The simple fact is people nowadays... do not need it.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  I can hardly even say “abandoned” is fair, my friend. When you buy an all-new intercity net-connected digital television, and you stow away your old radio into the cupboard, do you call that “abandoned?” 
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#3", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Rather, it’s forgotten. Not the kind that carries a spiteful meaning. It is the pure kind of forgetting, the one that results from the progress that scientific advancement and new modes of life bring. 
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  How can you denounce progress itself? My friend? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  Don’t call me “friend” this or “friend” that. There’s not a single friend of yours here.
[name="Old Knight"]  Finish up fast and trot on home. Maria isn’t on display here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  No, my friend, you are wrong once again.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Of course I do not stand in front of a knight simply to demean her status. No, but every knight has the obligation to recognize her own responsibility to Kazimierz.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Knights are no exhibits, but the most noble and lavish of the showcases, for all the world to gaze upon the beauty of Kazimierz! I dearly hope you can all understand this.
