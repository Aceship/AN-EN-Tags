[name="Platinum"]  ...Who are you? I’m looking for the director... 
[name="??? "]  Doesn’t matter. You should have received the authorization code for this terminal.
[name="Platinum"]  Since you know about this channel, you aren’t one of the two Lazurites. So...
[name="??? "]  Just keep your suspicions to yourself and refrain from looking too hard.
[name="??? "]  What I am saying next will be between the 'Armorless Union', and nothing to do with the 'directors'.
[name="Platinum"]  ......Alright.
[name="??? "]  A squad of campaign knights crossed into the Twilight Wood in secret. This went unnoticed by the General Chamber of Commerce, so it likely has something to do with the Radiant Knight.
[name="Platinum"]  Silverlance...?
[name="??? "]  The Lazurite will take full responsibility for this matter, don’t trouble yourself.
[name="Platinum"]  Haah? Since when are they so responsible?
[name="??? "]  Your mission is to monitor the Radiant Knight in their stead.
[name="Platinum"]  The Radiant Knight... that’s a pain.
[name="Platinum"]  ——So they’ve got an even bigger pain over there?
[name="??? "]  Still unclear. The ripples from a single stone spread far. The return of the Radiant Knight has brought us a lot of trouble... In fact, we’re devoting too much of our attention on her. 
[name="??? "]  ...One more thing.
[name="??? "]  No matter what, do not take action against the Sarkaz with the Radiant Knight.
[name="Platinum"]  Those two Sarkaz... You seem to know a lot about them.
[name="??? "]  The Confessarius and the Radiant Knight also belong to another 'company'. Will this matter be so simple...? I’m not sure.

[name="Senomy"]  Those stupid competition knights are just a bunch of trash willing to be manipulated for the sake of money.
[name="Senomy"]  If the young mistress of the Nearl family were to have an accident as well, don’t even bother calling this campaign knight a knight anymore! I’ll go flip the National Council’s goddamned table myself! 
[name="Senomy"]  ——That’s what the old man said.
[Character]
[name="??? "]  ...Senomy, there’s no need to mimic him so convincingly...
[Character(name="char_237_gravel")]
[name="Senomy"]  Ehh, but he specifically instructed me to convey the exact message.
[Character]
[name="??? "]  You don’t need to listen to everything he says.
[Character(name="char_237_gravel")]
[name="Senomy"]  He even said that if the Grand Knight didn’t agree, he’d go greet the Radiant Knight himself, even if he had to hobble all the way there.
[Character]
[name="??? "]  ......
[Character(name="char_237_gravel")]
[name="Senomy"]  He also said that if you sighed and cupped your forehead, reluctant to answer, he would——
[Character]
[name="??? "]  Alright, alright... I know how unhappy he is. He hasn’t changed at all, still causing a ruckus in the Court Sprawiedliwi Kazimierz every day over what few accomplishments he has...
[name="??? "]  Don’t forget he is still an offender.
[Character(name="char_237_gravel")]
[name="Senomy"]  But the National Council, totally corrupted by the General Chamber of Commerce, has no right to convict my old man. They don’t representing the citizens or the law at all. They’re just representing themselves and the merchants behind them. 
[Character]
[name="??? "]  ...He taught you that as well?
[Character(name="char_237_gravel")]
[name="Senomy"]  No, I figured that one out myself.
[Character]
[name="??? "]  *Sigh*...
[name="??? "]  Is that all?
[Character(name="char_237_gravel")]
[name="Senomy"]  Ah, there’s one more thing.
[Character]
[name="??? "]  ...Yeah.
[Character(name="char_237_gravel")]
[name="Senomy"]  The people from Rhodes Island seem to have arrived.
