[name="Maria"]  Team battle?
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]  It’s a two on two, a rather uncommon competition format. Originally, to showcase the teamwork within the Knightclubs, it should’ve been at least three on three or four on four.
[name="Zofia"]  No matter the format, you don’t have a Knightclub, so we need to find you a partner.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Maria"]  Oh... Who am I up against?
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]  The competition schedule says it’s the Snowyheel Knightclub.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  ...They have some decent archers, and even one knight that uses meteor hammers. I don’t know who you’ll end up against.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Maria’s finally reached the point where we’ll know her opponents by name alone, huh.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_061#2", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_061#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Maria, defeating Tytus is definitely something worth celebrating, but it also means that there will be a lot more eyes on you.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Draw on the lessons you learned from Flametail and Ashlock. Don’t tip your hand.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  It’s important to compromise and work with the corporations when you have to. Times have changed. You can’t hold onto your glory with wins alone.

[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Just use his workshop.

[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]  That’s why I wanted to introduce you to someone. A known quantity is always safer than getting a random stranger assigned by the Association.

[name="Maria"]  Err, who is it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]  The Fartooth Knight. She’s an expert archer.
[name="Zofia"]  Just like you, she fought her way up as an independent knight, refusing to accept sponsorships from the corporations. I’ve heard she’s even planning to form a completely self-sufficient knightclub.
[name="Zofia"]  I think you’ll be able to get along, and cover each other’s weaknesses in battle. You’ll come to understand that team battles are completely different from melees or one-on-ones.
[name="Zofia"]  If only we had more time, you could get to know each other better on the training field. Unfortunately, you’ll have to improvise.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Maria"]  ...O-okay.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_061#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  This is the disadvantage of being an independent knight... Temporary allies fighting against a battle-hardened team will always be at a disadvantage.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2")]
[name="Maria"]  I wonder what she’s like... I’m a little nervous...
