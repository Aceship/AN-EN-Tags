[name="Maria"]  Mr. Szewczyk, how’s the automatic cooling system doing for you during combat?
[Character(name="avg_npc_103")]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Well, color me surprised... If you figured that out so quickly, maybe you should’ve been a mechanic, not a knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#5")]
[name="Maria"]  —Mr. Szewczyk, you’re a really strong knight. Your speed and techniques are impeccable.
[name="Maria"]  Sadly, it looks like you chose to be a corporate product tester instead.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103")]

[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  I’m sure our audience is curious about that, too. I’ve always been an advocate for giving the knights mics—Who doesn’t want to listen in on our contestants trash-talking each other?!

[Character(name="avg_npc_121")]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  He stops! He shoots! Szewczyk’s starting his hunt again—Wait! Maria sidestepped the obstacles on the ground, and she’s dashing straight towards Szewczyk!   
[Character(name="avg_npc_103")]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Hmm?! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#3")]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Szewczyk! Szewczyk’s not moving an inch! Is he going to take that hit straight on like last time?!
