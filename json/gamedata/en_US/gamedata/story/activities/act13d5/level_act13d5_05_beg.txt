[name="Corporate Employee"]  Y-Yes, if you put it that way, I’d definitely be a good person, a good person like so many others in Kazimierz...

[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Indeed, so many others. Here. Let us toast to the good people.

[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Even the countryside farmers, done tending their fields for the day, will look forward to that competition knight broadcast from the city.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  For hundreds of thousands... possibly millions of Kazimierz’s industrial people, the Major is a part of life. And they are all good people, by and large, my friend.

[name="Corporate Employee"]  So, you mean...
[Character(name="avg_npc_109#2", name2="avg_npc_106#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Suppose, one day, the Major was gone... that overnight, the business had vanished.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Who would now support our campaign knights’ expenditures, which grow annum by annum? Who would vie for Kazimierz’s economic standing, and so stave off foreign incursions?
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  My friend, tell me. Are those who would see that happen—bad people?

[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  You are a good person, and they would deprive you of your own living to crown their ancient sense of 'honor.'
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  We all rely on others to pave the way. We’ve given the vast majority—even the Infected—the chance to live...
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  And so those 'bad people' would ignore that, their country and all its citizens, for their own inconsequential, self-centered consolation.
