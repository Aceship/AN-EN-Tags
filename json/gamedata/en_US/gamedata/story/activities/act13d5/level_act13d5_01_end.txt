[name="Zofia"]  ...You know about the team melees?
[name="Zofia"]  Those are the matches draw the crowds to the Kazimierz Major. Each knightclub sends a single representative—Well, in your case, you’re joining the fray as an individual.
[name="Zofia"]  You have somewhere around a couple dozen people all in a huge, man-made arena. You rack up points by striking your opponents’ armor, and those are added to your overall score.
[name="Zofia"]  Of course... if you’re defeated or incapacitated before the time limit, you’re immediately eliminated, and you score zero points.

[name="Zofia"]  The longest melee match ever lasted the entire day and well into the night, after the audience kept cheering and the corporations kept tacking on overtime.
[name="Zofia"]  The knights in that match were like a bunch of Gloompincers locked in a cage together. They had to rally themselves over and over to keep fighting each other.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Maria"]  Umm...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]  One by one, the contestants fell either from exhaustion or injury, and no one got anything to show for it. On the other hand, the three who lasted till the very end raked in more than enough points to immediately advance to the main competitions.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#7", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Maria"]  I-I see... so the match lasted a whole day, and only three made it through...
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#7", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]  Once we got the first division sponsor pushing that kind of ruleset, the copycats started to show up left and right across all divisions like Originium Slugs.
[name="Zofia"]  It’s certainly not a pretty sight, but what’s worse is that the audience likes it. So nothing else matters.
[name="Zofia"]  Which means you’ll have to be ready to fight an entire day!
