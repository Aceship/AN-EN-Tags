[name="??? "]  ...I see you've arrived, Mr. Mob.
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Wait. It's you. I saw you back at the arena and you said—
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="??? "]  No. That's neither here nor there. Now, don't be so wound up. Take a seat.
[name="??? "]  Allow me to introduce myself again—please, call me Czarny. I'm one of the rotational managers, currently responsible for a division of the Knights Association.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  I'm also an executive of the Mieszko Group Major & Publicity Department, and have had the great fortune to be selected as Divisional Spokesman to the General Chamber of Commerce.
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Th—The GCC? Pardon me for my incredible rudeness earlier, Mr. Czarny... 
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Forego the formality. I'm no critic of your... vernacular, 'Greatmouth Mob.' Or, perhaps, I should be calling you by your real name?
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  N-No need...
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Haha, I only jest... Now, why don't we take a look outside. Glorious view, isn't it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  There are some old types that hate this reinforced concrete jungle, the city of seamless day and night. But if you ask me, it is what symbolizes our strides towards civilization.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Our vast forests, grassland expanses, are a priceless part of Kazimierz, true, but our hardy Kazimierz hands built up great skyscrapers where the forests parted. It's something we ought to be proud of.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  It is the only way we find shelter when a Catastrophe strikes, the only way form a front that can stand firm against our foreign enemies. Kazimierz is now prosperous, a rapidly developing place... 
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Would you agree? Mr. Mob? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_121", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Course! You're right on the mark! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_121", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  But Kazimierz's strides are far from over. The road we have to walk is still long.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  For example... Mr. Mob, take your hometown, our 'City of Saplings and Artisans,' Ognisko.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  In the thousand miles around it, how many deprived villages lie? How many troubled lands unafforded the protection of a city?
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Y-You really know your stuff, for sure. I was outta there, like, twenty-plus years ago.  Can I, uh, ask why you're telling me all this, though?  Truth is, you're kinda bugging me out here...  
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Your frankness is another part of what draws me to you. I've come to make you an offer, Mr. Mob. One that will take us in joint strides. You've been poached. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  ...Me? But I just took a down from the Roar Guards Company... 
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Please, relax. This contract is confidential, sealed by none other than Mr. Pavel himself. Now, from today on, your employer will be...
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  S-So I'm a Mieszko guy now? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  You could put it that way... but let me nitpick it very slightly.
[Character(name="avg_npc_121", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Yeah?
[Character(name="avg_npc_121", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  From now on, you're MY guy, Mr. Anchorman.

[name="Zofia"]  If we're going to make the cut for the Major, we need to get a lot more points, fast—that's the biggest hurdle we face, as independent knights without a Knightclub to hide in.
[name="Zofia"]  Remember Szewczyk? Poor man, taken for a ride by his own sponsor. And yet he built up the points to rival nearly an entire team, just on sprint races, and duels alone.
[name="Zofia"]  Meanwhile, you had the Knightclubs all wrangling the rules for point transfers, arranging it so their trump cards didn't even need to fight the preselections...
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=1)]
