[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sophia")] Alright, I shall be substituting for Dobermann today. This will be an 'interesting' combat training. Ready?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_scave")] So it's a simulation of a Kazimierz knight competition... Fighting against great odds in a man-made landscape really does fit their style.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_scave")] ...But are those people really knights?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_wyvern")] They're just fans of knight sports making a cameo here. Look, even this gloompincer here——
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sophia")] That is an honest-to-god gloompincer, you know. Even though they're raised through far more humane methods in Rhodes Island.. They can still easily cleave through armor.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_wyvern")] Eh!? Noooo...!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_frostl")] Oh, come on. I'll deal with it!
