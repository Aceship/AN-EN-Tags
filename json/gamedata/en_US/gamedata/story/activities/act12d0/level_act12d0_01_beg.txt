Everything you could ever want is right here.
The moment of peace you’ve longed for. A land without warfare, the embrace of your mother.
Your consciousness expands limitlessly, breaking its shackles. You are free.

[Decision(options="What is freedom?;I’m free!", values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
Broadly speaking, to be free is a relative state, free from constraints. However, people who say this are often constrained by their flesh.
But you are truly free.
[Predicate(references="2")]
That’s right, my dear friend. You are free, and you forever will be.
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
You are a resolute stone in the river of time. Though your responsibilities, fate, desires, and attachments may all be washed away, you, and only you, will always exist here.
You are beholden to nothing, and nothing is beholden to you.
[Decision(options="There is nothing better than this!;Responsibilities. Fate. Desires. Attachments...", values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
You understand everything. Right now, you are speaking to an unfathomable being. Gaze in awe and offer up your purest blood.
Or maybe you have merely been hit on the head and fallen into a state of unconsciousness. You are simply carrying out a meaningless conversation with an imaginary self.

A wise decision, my King. This place is broader than Terra itself, and you can build whatever you wish here.
First of all, let’s found a country. How about naming it the Land of Existence?
The country raised on the banks of Nothingness shall last a thousand years——
Oh, pardon me. It seems that our noble cause must come to an end here.
Like a ray of light that shines through the curtains, a strong sense of discomfort suddenly invades your consciousness.
[Predicate(references="4")]
You love pain. You like exhaustion. You enjoy plunging into the flames. You relish getting hurt.
Smart people are forever seeking a failure that is just right, some loss that can be aptly contained. They believe this is the best way to help themselves grow.
Do not become conceited, my dear Secretary of the Nothingness Department.
Well then. Firstly, let’s grant you some of that pain that you love oh so much——
From every nook and cranny of your flesh, comes the sensation of extreme soreness.
[Predicate(references="2")]
Soldier, you have borne countless pains, witnessed innumerable failures. There is little that brings you joy.
But that is exactly what has allowed you to come this far. They are a poison, shackles upon your self. They will never let you know peace.
Some things can never be taken back. Some things you need not burden yourself with.
[Decision(options="You’re right. It’s time for me to rest.;No, there are people waiting for me.",values="5;6")]
[Predicate(references="5")]
Yes, my dear. That is how it should be.
Relax. I will sing to you a lullaby, and you shall rest in eternal sleep, undisturbed forevermore.
And yet, just as you fall into slumber, a powerful sensation assaults you——pain!
[Predicate(references="6")]
Ah, I see. I do admit they are all good children.
But did you ever consider that even without you, those kids will still be able to move forward? You are not responsible for them.
Your responsibilities. Your fate. Your desires. Your connection to them. Are they but a delusion of yours?
...Fine. Since you have already made your decision, I shall grant you a surprise. That’s right, it is none other than the pain you love so much!
From every nook and cranny of your flesh, comes the sensation of extreme soreness.

What follows is a distant yet familiar voice.
[name="? ??"]  ...D-Doctor!
Amiya? No, no. This voice is far more mature than Amiya’s.

You feel several slaps on what seems to be your cheeks. It would appear they are willing to practice what they preach.
[name="? ??"]  That didn’t do the trick... Hmm, what should I do? Since Amiya isn’t here, guess I’ll just give the Doctor a few rounds of the whirlwind.
[name="? ??"]  Whirlwind? Is it fun? I want to play too!
It seems they are preparing some extreme measures now. Also, the voice that just cut in carries a hint of innocence.
The problem? In this situation, the wonderful trait of innocence belies a sense of commitment.

Oh, woe. Some journeys cannot be undertaken by your will alone. You have already lost the chance to step out on this journey.
