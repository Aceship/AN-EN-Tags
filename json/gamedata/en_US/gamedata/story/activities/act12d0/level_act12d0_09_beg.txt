[name="Gavial"]  Tomimi, are you okay?
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  I won’t let you leave!
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Huh? Why?
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  B-because I don’t want to be without you again!
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Huh?
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  I wanted to become Great Chief so I could force you to stay...
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2")]
[name="Eunectes"]  Does that mean you’re the one who organized the ceremony this time?
[Character(name="char_411_tomimi_1#2")]
[name="Tomimi"]  Yes. If you didn’t show up in the middle of it, I’d have become the Great Chief.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2")]
[name="Eunectes"]  ...I see.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2")]
[name="Gavial"]  Huh? What are you guys talking about?

[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2")]
[name="Gavial"]  Hm? What are you talking about, Doctor? What’s that about the ceremony?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2")]
[name="Eunectes"]  You’re pretty smart, outsider.
[name="Eunectes"]  Just think about it for a minute, Gavial.
[name="Eunectes"]  Ever since you left, most of the tribes dissolved into the many smaller tribes we know today. Without a central leader, the tribes couldn’t come together to do anything at all.
[name="Eunectes"]  So how could we suddenly put on a ceremony? There had to be someone organizing things behind the scenes.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_416_zumama_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Hm? Wasn’t it you who organized the ceremony?
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_416_zumama_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]  It wasn’t me. The Big Ugly still needed an engine. It wasn’t done. I was planning to wait another year before contacting the other tribes to hold the ceremony, but then, all of a sudden, it was happening.
[name="Eunectes"]  It was unexpected, but I didn’t mind. I thought that, even an incomplete Big Ugly could have shocked the world.
[name="Eunectes"]  The unexpected part was you coming back.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2")]
[name="Gavial"]  Now that you mention it, Tomimi was the one who asked me to return.
[name="Gavial"]  So you really did orchestrate everything.
[Character(name="char_411_tomimi_1")]
[name="Tomimi"]  ...Yes.
[name="Tomimi"]  I’ve been studying for years to learn what I would need to convince the other tribes to make me the Great Chief. 
[name="Tomimi"]  But, it’s not too late...The tribes under my command are waiting out there, and the Big Ugly has been defeated. No one can stop me from making Gavial stay!
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2")]
[name="Gavial"]  Why do you want me here so badly?
[Character(name="char_411_tomimi_1")]
[name="Tomimi"]  B-Because...

[name="Tomimi"]  Gavial...
[name="Gavial"]  You’re such a pain. I let you out of my sight for one second and you run off to a place like this.
[name="Tomimi"]  Gavial, you’re bleeding!
[name="Gavial"]  Huh? It’s fine, it’s just a little cut.
[name="Gavial"]  Come on, let’s go home.

[Character(name="char_411_tomimi_1#2")]

[name="Tomimi"]  If you surrender, I-I won’t hurt you!
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#4")]
[name="Gavial"]  You can’t keep me here, Tomimi.
[Character(name="char_411_tomimi_1#2")]
[name="Tomimi"]  ...T-That’s not up to you!
[name="Tomimi"]  Everyone, attack!
