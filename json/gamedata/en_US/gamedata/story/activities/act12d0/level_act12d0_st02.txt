[name="Dylan"]  Lancet-2, I have a serious question.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Go ahead.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  Isn’t your battery running low?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Oh, don’t worry about that. Before we left, the lovely Ms. Closure fitted me with a brand new, extra long-lasting battery.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Theoretically, I could function for a week without needing a charge.
[name="Lancet-2"]  The aircraft is also carrying spare batteries, so you don’t have to worry about me.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  Okay.
[name="Dylan"]  Now where did Kay run off to? On our way back, the kiddo suddenly hopped to her feet and jetted away.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  It’s true, we should be concerned about Ceobe’s condition, but considering her strength and constitution, we don’t need to be too concerned.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  That’s true.
[name="Dylan"]  Hah, I’m bored.
[name="Dylan"]  We fixed up the aircraft, patched up the wounded Gavial sent over, and now we’ve got nothing to do.
[name="Dylan"]  That we can’t speak the local language is just a cherry on top. I should’ve gone to that ceremony with the Doctor.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  The aircraft is an important Rhodes Island asset, it’s our responsibility to guard it well.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  I’m just saying. I mean, I’m a pilot, I know the deal with the aircraft.
[name="Dylan"]  You’re lucky, Lancet-2, you can just switch into sleep mode when you’re bored. I was out for twelve hours yesterday, so I’m wide awake.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Well, actually, I have no ability to feel "boredom".
[name="Lancet-2"]  Although I do understand what this feeling is, Mr. Dylan. The lovely Ms. Closure complains about these things a lot. And it causes her to behave in strange ways.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  ...I think about this sometimes, Lancet-2, are we totally sure you and the other bots don’t have a human crammed up in there anywhere?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  We don’t. My interior is a precisely-designed circuitry construct. Do you want to see?
[name="Lancet-2"]  Although, since I have been programmed with a female personality, I may act out in unexpected ways when presenting my body to the opposite sex.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  Err, I’ll pass.
[name="Dylan"]  If was going to see anything, I’d definitely prefer a swimsuit at a time like this.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  A swimsuit?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  Yeah, it’s summertime. That’s when you put on a swimsuit and go play in the water.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  In that case, I’ll play an audio recording of various sea sounds for you.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  No thanks, it’d only make me feel worse.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  ...Then maybe... Mr. Dylan would like to see me in a swimsuit?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  Definitely not!
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Oh, sorry. I am only a robot, after all.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  Err, I’m the one who’s sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Don’t worry about it. By the way, have you seen the sea, Mr. Dylan?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  Um, I have. I’m thinking it was that time we loaned Master SilverAsh an aircraft last summer after a schedule change mixed things up. I flew him there.
[name="Dylan"]  It turns out, the place was a major vacation spot. Master SilverAsh made me a VIP guest.
[name="Dylan"]  Man, that’s when I realized how us poor folks could scarcely imagine what the rich live like.
[name="Dylan"]  Here, I’ve got the pictures with me.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  You long for this kind of life, Mr. Dylan?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  Hm? I mean... that was a really great couple of days, but if my whole life was like that, I don’t think I’d ever get used to it.
[name="Dylan"]  I’m more of an instant-noodles-in-the-cockpit kind of guy. With an inverted sleep schedule to boot.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Oh you can’t do that. Let me formulate a healthy lifestyle plan for you.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  No thanks, I’m good!
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Too bad. The lovely Ms. Closure created this feature for me, but no one uses it. Not her, not the Doctor.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  Haha, sounds about right.
[name="Dylan"]  Oh, but that reminds me, the tribes here live so much better than I thought. They really want for nothing.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Yes, life here is less convenient and comfortable than the world we know, but not to any significant degree.
[name="Lancet-2"]  According to my records, your health has improved in the past two days.
[name="Dylan"]  Really?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Really.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  Turns out returning to nature will do that for you. Heh. I guess this is the life that everyone came from.
[name="Dylan"]  Oh yeah, I just remembered, Gavial said something about a gigantic waterfall in the rainforest that way. I’d love to go there when the Doctor gets back.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  They may have already gone that way.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Dylan"]  The Doctor is a good boss. And I know our friends wouldn’t abandon us to go play under the waterfall!
