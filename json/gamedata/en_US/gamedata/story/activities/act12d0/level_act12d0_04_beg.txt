[name="Archosauria C"]  Great Chief! Great Chief!
[name="Archosauria D"]  Eunectes, marry me!
[Character(name="avg_npc_071")]
[name="Archosauria Warrior"]  ...Well, look who showed up. Eunectes.
[name="Archosauria Warrior"]  I thought you were going to hide in that little rainforest of yours, too scared to show up.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1")]
[name="Eunectes"]  And you're too afraid to come visit?
[Character(name="avg_npc_071")]
[name="Archosauria Warrior"]  Hmph, you're all cowards for holing up in your rainforest!
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1")]
[name="Eunectes"]  We'll find out right now if that really makes me a coward.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#3")]
[name="Gavial"]  Well, even with all those weird gadgets, Zumama hasn't changed one bit.
[name="Gavial"]  Oh, right. Doctor, I never told you about her, did I?
[name="Gavial"]  That girl in the arena is Zumama. We aren't from the same tribe, but we lived pretty close to each other. Plus, we're about the same age, so you could say we grew up together.
[name="Gavial"]  She doesn't talk much, but she handles herself in a fight.
[name="Gavial"]  She started acting kinda weird at some point, though. I mean, she was still pretty tough, but she was always tinkering with stuff all by herself.
[name="Gavial"]  Her tribe moved away not long after that, and we didn't see each other much anymore.
[name="Gavial"]  Word is she's as strong as ever, but she came down with some weird disease and started talking to herself.
[name="Gavial"]  I looked into the symptoms back at Rhodes Island. It sounded like some kind of mental illness, but she looks pretty normal to me right now.
[name="Gavial"]  I was half-expecting her to come to the last ceremony, but too bad she never did.
[name="Gavial"]  And now she's here, calling herself Eunectes? Who would've thought? Anyway, now that she's here, you see that guy up there? Probably done for.

[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1")]
[name="Eunectes"]  Who are you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_071")]
[name="Archosauria"]  I'm the leader of the Raging Flames, Uda!

[name="Eunectes"]  I wasn't expecting it to be a walk in the park. But I didn't know you could be so unified.
[Character(name="avg_npc_071")]
[name="Uda"]  What's that got to do with you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_070")]
[name="Aruna"]  Hmph, and a Great Chief who's always tinkering with widgets? You can bet I have a problem with that!

[name="Gavial"]  Most folks fight one-on-one out of pride, but the only rule the ceremony's got is that you can do whatever it takes to win, and whoever that ends up winning will become the Great Chief.
[name="Gavial"]  Obviously, bringing your lackeys with you is the best way to get that done.

[Predicate(references="3")]
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#3")]
[name="Gavial"]  Hahaha, Doctor. I hate to break it to you, but you don't have what it takes.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1")]
[name="Gavial"]  I did say there's no rules, but it's not what you're thinking.
[name="Gavial"]  The folks here are pretty simple. The only thing they can think of is to bring lots of people with 'em, no matter what it is they're trying to do.
[name="Gavial"]  No one here would even think of pulling any dirty tricks.
[name="Gavial"]  Honestly, even after my years with Rhodes Island, I've still got no idea how to go do that kinda stuff.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  Yep. Besides, fighting as a group has its own risks. 
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#3", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Haha, that's right. They might just start infighting afterwards. Happens all the time.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#3")]
[name="Gavial"]  But on the flipside, that does mean you can do whatever it takes for you to win, and you're free to try.
[name="Gavial"]  But I'm sure you're just gonna get yourself beaten up.

[Predicate(references="3")]
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1")]
[name="Gavial"]  Yeah, it wasn't till I left that I found out just how simple things were back home.
[name="Gavial"]  I used to think everyone everywhere would be just like us.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1")]
[name="Gavial"]  Well, Doctor, I do think you'd be able to pull it off and still keep it under wraps, but there's one thing that separates you from the rest of them. Do you know what that is?
[Decision(options="Muscle?;......;Looks?",values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2")]
[name="Gavial"]  Exactly! Look how weak you are!

[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2")]
[name="Gavial"]  Come on, Doctor. Don't pout.
[Predicate(references="3")]
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1")]
[name="Gavial"]  You could say that. I mean, you have any idea how weak you look?
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1")]
[name="Gavial"]  Anyway, I'll get right down to it. If you want to be the Great Chief, there's actually just one requirement that you've gotta meet.
[name="Gavial"]  You just gotta be strong enough to put up a good fight.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#3", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Right, Tomimi?
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#3", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  Hm? Yeah, yeah!
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  This is strange, though. From what I remember, those two aren't exactly best friends. I didn't expect to see them working together.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  Hmm, they probably became friends after you left.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Yeah, could be.
[name="Gavial"]  Hmm? Tomimi, didn't you say Zumama is her tribe's leader? Where are her people?
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  Huh? Now that you mention it, I don't see a lot of people from her tribe.
[name="Tomimi"]  Look, the ones dressed differently over there should be from her tribe.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Well, they all look pretty well-equipped, but that's not a whole lot of them.
[name="Gavial"]  Heh, she's following in my footsteps and trying to take them all down by herself, isn't she? Now that's what I'm talking about!
[name="Gavial"]  That reminds me. Tomimi, I thought you were going to fight.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  Eh? Yeah, but I'm in no rush.
[name="Tomimi"]  Zumama's tough. The Scars won't stand a chance against her, so I'll join in after she wears herself out on them.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Hehe, you've gotten smarter, Tomimi.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  Ehehe, I'm pretty serious about becoming the Great Chief. Besides...
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Besides what?
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1")]
[name="Gavial"]  Oh, let's talk later. They're about to get started!
