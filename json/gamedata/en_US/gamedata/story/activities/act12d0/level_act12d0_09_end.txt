[name="Kal'tsit"]  Seeing as the aircraft is still in reparable condition, I won't be too hard on you. But the maintenance costs are coming out of your pay, and Blaze's.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#10", name2="char_003_kalts_1", focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]  Aww, and mine...?

[name="Kal'tsit"]  An elite operator takes elite responsibility. 
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#10", name2="char_003_kalts_1", focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]  Agh, fine.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  As for the three individuals you brought back, since you seem to think they have what it takes to be operators, I'll leave them to the Doctor.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Gavial, were you satisfied with your trip back home?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]  Huh? Sure. But even I didn't think it'd go down like that. It was fun.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Honestly, I had a contingency plan in case the Doctor didn't bring you back.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]  Why?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Because I figured there was a possibility you'd want to stay there.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]  Huh? Kal'tsit, I thought you knew me better than that.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You've never really adapted to life outside your tribe. Every day, you come into conflict with the world, in your own ferocious way.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I'll put it this way: if someday you asked for a leave of absence, or if you just left, I wouldn't be surprised. 
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1")]
[name="Gavial"]  Hey, Doctor, maybe I'm not getting this right. Is Kal'tsit saying she cares about me?

[name="Gavial"]  Then I'm gonna go ahead and say you care about me.

[name="Gavial"]  That's our Kal'tsit, even confusing the Doctor.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1")]
[name="Gavial"]  Kal'tsit, I'm not going anywhere.
[name="Gavial"]  I had a reason to leave my tribe. I really did want to practice medicine. 
[name="Gavial"]  Now that's not to say I really thought I could become a doctor, but I'm very happy I made that decision.
[name="Gavial"]  From a modern medical standpoint, we pretty much have no doctors back home. If you get sick, you just let it run its course. Maybe try a few traditional remedies. 
[name="Gavial"]  If I never left, I wouldn't know what the world is really like.
[name="Gavial"]  I wouldn't know how many diseases are preventable or curable, I wouldn't know how people look down on Oripathy. I wouldn't know that saving lives makes me as happy as taking them.
[name="Gavial"]  The world is definitely complicated, and I don't always know what motivates people, or why they fight.
[name="Gavial"]  But I'm a doctor now. And my dream is to treat Oripathy.
[name="Gavial"]  Is there a better place in this wide world for me to study and practice medicine?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I'm afraid not.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]  Well how about that. And by the way, you all work a lot harder than I do. What's with you here worrying about me?
[name="Gavial"]  Honestly, I think I should be worrying about you, Kal'tsit.
[name="Gavial"]  You didn't pick up my slack while I was away now, did you?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  No.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]  Good. I'm gonna give Zumama an Oripathy checkup. You have a nice chat now.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#1")]
[name="Blaze"]  Oh, I'll see what Kemar's up to. Err, I guess I'm calling her Flint now. I'm worried she'll get into a fight, with the language barrier and all...
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#3")]
[name="Gavial"]  Doctor, Tomimi should be in her general studies class now. You check on her when you're done.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Gavial.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]  Hm?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Welcome back.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Haha.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#1")]
[name="Blaze"]  Hey! What about me? !
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#1", name2="char_003_kalts_1", focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You had another mission ready to go last week. You're technically very late.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#10", name2="char_003_kalts_1", focus=1)]
[name="Blaze"]  Oh...

[name="Kal'tsit"]  In your eyes, you just went on a nonsensical journey. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But, just like our Gavial, it was a showcase of the lively and diverse world we inhabit.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We lose so much to the endless march of time. That which was once a fact of life in the past is now precious to us.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We search for the light that slips through the breaks in the crowd and begin to see that as the norm.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I hope you and your fellow operators learned a lesson from this trip: some things are not too far out of reach.

[name="Closure"]  Kal'tsit, meeting time!
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")] 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I know.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Now then, Dr. {@nickname}, you have a lot of work waiting for you.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I hope you got enough rest on your vacation.
