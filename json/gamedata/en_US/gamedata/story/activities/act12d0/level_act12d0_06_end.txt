[Character(name="avg_npc_071")]
[name="Clan Leader A"]  The people of the Great Wood Tribe are gone. I heard that leader was defeated by an outsider.
[Character(name="avg_npc_070")]
[name="Peta"]  The Firestone and Thick Tail Tribes were defeated by an stranger carrying a pile of weapons on her back.
[Character(name="avg_npc_071")]
[name="Clan Leader A"]  Some of the tribes decided to join up with Zumama.
[Character(name="avg_npc_070")]
[name="Clan Leader B"]  The truth is Zumama’s managed to drum up a formidable front. If I weren’t with Gavial, I might have gone to Zumama myself.
[Character]
[name="???"]  Doesn’t matter.
[name="???"]  Your tribes will be enough.
[Character(name="avg_npc_070")]
[name="Clan Leader B"]  Hey, can we really challenge Zumama on our own?
[Character]
[name="???"]  Yes.
[name="???"]  Gavial can definitely beat Zumama’s giant machine. Then, I will become the Great Chief and force Gavial to stay.
[Character(name="avg_npc_070")]
[name="Peta"]  Peta thinks that is not a good idea.

[name="???"]  But this is the only way to make her stay.
[name="???"]  Don’t forget why we formed 'Gavial's Will'!
[name="???"]  'Gavial's Will' is not just a tribe. It is an alliance dedicated to the vision of Gavial as the Great Chief!
[Character(name="avg_npc_070")]
[name="Clan Leader B"]  I agree with Tomimi. I’ll only recognize Gavial as the Great Chief.
[Character(name="avg_npc_071")]
[name="Clan Leader A"]  That’s right, Gavial should be the one to lead us!
[Character(name="avg_npc_070")]
[name="Clan Leader C"]  Hah, if I disagreed I wouldn’t be here either!
[name="Peta"]  ...Peta doesn’t like it, but Peta will follow.
[Character]
[name="???"]  Alright, you head over to Zumama’s tribe and wait outside for me, got it?
[name="Other Clan Leaders"]  Yes.
[name="???"]  Right. This is all for Gavial.

[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_017_homura_summer", focus=2)]
[name="Blaze"]  I ran into this little girl on my way over here. She started hitting me for some reason.
[name="Blaze"]  I kicked her ass, of course, and beat down all her friends too.
[name="Blaze"]  Gotta hand it to her, she’s not bad in a fight, didn’t go down easy. So I brought her along. I figured you could help me ask why she wanted to fight me.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_017_homura_summer", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  It’s Kemar. She probably just thought you looked strong. She just loves fighting.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_017_homura_summer", focus=2)]
[name="Blaze"]  Hah. That means something, coming from you.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_017_homura_summer", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  I don’t love fighting. I’m just a hands-on problem solver.

[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2", name2="char_415_flint_1", focus=2)]
[name="Flint"]  I felt a greater strength from her than anything I ever felt from Zumama.
[name="Flint"]  I’m not interested in you anymore, Gavial. Looks like you can talk to her, so please, ask her to teach me.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_017_homura_summer", focus=1)]
