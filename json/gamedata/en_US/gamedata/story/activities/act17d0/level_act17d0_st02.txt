[name="Ash"]...Hard to say.
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1")]
[name="Tachanka"]I heard the old lizard man say that only important people get funerals in this country.
[name="Tachanka"]Most ordinary folks just die when they die, and their families bury them in the wastes. No tombstones, no mourning.
[name="Tachanka"]The people who live on the huge platforms, the moving cities, have to cremate the dead and bury the ashes under those major roads, since space is so precious in the city.
[name="Tachanka"]Cemeteries are rare in an ordinary settlement, where a disaster can come through and wipe out any memory of where the dead are buried.
[name="Tachanka"]There's basically no religion in Sargon. Most people here don't believe in an afterlife. They think the dead return to the earth, and become part of it.
[name="Tachanka"]Looking at it like that, it's a pretty honest and practical culture. I like it.
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1", name2="char_456_ash_1#8",focus=2)]
[name="Ash"]So Miarow's grave will be lost someday?
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1", name2="char_456_ash_1#8",focus=1)]
[name="Tachanka"]Probably. But we held a funeral for him. And that was important.
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1", name2="char_456_ash_1#8",focus=2)]
[name="Ash"]I can't really accept that.
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1", name2="char_456_ash_1#8",focus=1)]
[name="Tachanka"]Why?
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1", name2="char_456_ash_1#8",focus=2)]
[name="Ash"]After seeing what I saw, it's hard to accept how he went.
[name="Ash"]We probably bear some responsibility, Alexsandr.
[name="Ash"]If it weren't for Miarow, we would've had a much rougher time here.
[name="Ash"]I've been thinking, what if we'd moved a little faster? If we were tougher? If we really decided to do something for those sick people?
[name="Ash"]If we...
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1", name2="char_456_ash_1#8",focus=1)]
[name="Tachanka"]I don't think it's a good idea to get caught up in thoughts like that.
[name="Tachanka"]Miarow made his own choices. This isn't your fault.
[name="Tachanka"]The big girl was trying to fulfill her duty. As an aristocrat growing up in this culture, in this system, her willingness to shelter the sick was definitely a noble act.
[name="Tachanka"]Judging by how the Rhodes Islanders talk, Miarow was very, very sick.
[name="Tachanka"]For him, death was something that hung over him every day.
[name="Tachanka"]It's a miracle he lasted as long as he did, in his condition.
[name="Tachanka"]That's how they live. And there's not much we can do about it.
[Character(name="char_456_ash_1#8")]
[name="Ash"]But did we really do the right thing?
[delay(time=1)]
[name="Ash"]We were so sure that if we reached out to help them, we would actually be helping them.
[name="Ash"]And I have no idea why.
[name="Ash"]We lived with those sick people.
[name="Ash"]But we didn't know anything about the Infected. We thought of that 'Oripathy' like a slightly infectious cancer, the deadly, incurable disease we already knew.
[name="Ash"]But this isn't a disease, really... it's a disaster.
[name="Ash"]We don't know anything about it. And we still tried to save them.

[name="Tachanka"]You can't blame yourself for nothing, Cohen.
[name="Tachanka"]It's pointless.
[name="Tachanka"]I understand what you're feeling.
[name="Tachanka"]But you can't deny what we did.
[name="Tachanka"]Remember when I was up on that roof with nothing to do? I had all that time on my hands.
[name="Tachanka"]I sat there, watching Miarow's clinic, watching the people who lived there.
[name="Tachanka"]As a visitor from another world, I witnessed this one.
[name="Tachanka"]I'm not a sharp person, but even I could see the many, terrible, cruel things.
[name="Tachanka"]One night, one of the townsfolk was carrying a package from another's house under the cover of darkness.
[name="Tachanka"]It was a burlap-wrapped parcel, about as tall as a man.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#8")]
[name="Ash"]......
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1")]
[name="Tachanka"]I watched them load the package into a handcart and make their way along the edge of town to the rocky desert, disappearing behind the boulders on the south side.
[name="Tachanka"]I saw it happen just like that several times. Maybe twice in the past three weeks. And it must have been happening in other places too, where I couldn't see it.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#8")]
[name="Ash"]You never mentioned this before.
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1")]
[name="Tachanka"]I didn't want to say anything. I didn't have a reason to.
[name="Tachanka"]You're right. We're outsiders. We're not from this country. We're not even from this world.
[name="Tachanka"]We can't understand the people here. Their history, their culture, their lives, their feelings, we couldn't hope to know.
[name="Tachanka"]And I have no right to point my finger at something I don't understand. There's a reason they do what they do.
[name="Tachanka"]That's how it should be.
[name="Tachanka"]But then, one night, my curiosity got the better of me. I followed the path to the boulder where they buried the sack.
[name="Tachanka"]I saw the light shimmering beneath the sand. I saw the dust rising up from the rocks and dissipating into the air.
[name="Tachanka"]That dust is so bright, in the dark of the night.
[name="Tachanka"]I knew, of course, what was in the sack. I could probably guess what the dust was.
[name="Tachanka"]And naturally, we all know exactly what it is now.
[name="Tachanka"]There was an old woman who sat by the door of the house where the sack came from. After that night, I never saw her again.
[name="Tachanka"]KÃ¶tz spent every day with the townsfolk. He must've known about it too.
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1", name2="char_456_ash_1#8",focus=2)]
[name="Ash"]*Sigh*.
[name="Ash"]What was the excuse you made up before...? Everyone looks like they've had chemical warfare training? They know to cover their noses and mouths? What a lame explanation.
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1", name2="char_456_ash_1#8",focus=1)]

[name="Tachanka"]The answer is simple: we helped them. Because that's what our morals, our conscience, told us to do.
[name="Tachanka"]Aging, illness, and death are inevitable. In this world and ours.
[name="Tachanka"]Even if there wasn't this Oripathy, the people wouldn't suffer any less.
[name="Tachanka"]Even without the disease, they'd have war, taxation, and natural disasters crushing the poor.
[name="Tachanka"]See their Lord and this town, what kind of a society do they live in?
[name="Tachanka"]Such feudalism would be far behind the times in the history of the Earth we know. But it's the reality for them.

[name="Picale"]He always was, ever since I was small.
[name="Picale"]The Tulla family was built on the blood and bones of miners.
[name="Picale"]For years, my father grew wealthy digging Originium out of the ground.
[name="Picale"]But with it came the spread of Oripathy. It was just the miners, at first... but it eventually spread through the town.
[name="Picale"]When the Originium closer to the surface was all mined out, my father closed the quarry. He wouldn't let anyone dig any deeper.
[name="Picale"]He created the Infected quarter, and sent men to protect the people living there. He couldn't just sit on the pile of Infected corpses and count his gold.
[name="Picale"]He always hoped my brother Drudge and I could do better.
