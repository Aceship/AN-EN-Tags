[name="Franka"]Cities can be torn apart by Catastrophes while the wildlife emerges untouched
[name="Franka"]—Nature in this world is ruthless when it wants to eliminate you. If you don't have some way of dealing with Originium, your time as a living species won't be long.
[Character(name="avg_npc_166")]
[name="Schwarz"]I think... I have a hypothesis. Like ordinary Originium Slugs, the body's outer shell could have absorbed Originium into its makeup, while its innards remain clean and uncorrupted.
[Character(name="avg_npc_155_1#1",name2="avg_npc_156_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]On that note, has P.R.T.S ever recorded any similar cases?

[name="Franka"]None. Not even for the Ironforge City leakage incident in Columbia, and that's the first thing you'd think of.
[Character(name="char_503_rang")]
[name="Rangers"]Sand beasts are docile creatures by nature. Originium shouldn't change them so drastically, and I can't imagine anything short of Arts would make them outright aggressive.

[Character(name="char_503_rang")]

[name="Rangers"]Truthfully, in a few areas, Rhodes Island will make a habit of hiding some safehouses, out of the way. For use in very particular field missions.

[Character(name="char_503_rang")]
[name="Rangers"]Long Spring... Long Spring...
[name="Rangers"]That name rings a faint bell. If you could let me see the map for a second.
[name="Rangers"]Hmm...
[name="Rangers"]Here, if I'm not mistaken. Following about twenty kilometers north from Trumhill, you should find another canyon. That canyon had a little village near it, I'm sure of it.
