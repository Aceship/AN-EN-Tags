[name="Blitz"]No, then? What about like a healing potion that you drink it and all your wounds close right up? None of that either?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]That's the stuff of sci-fi novels.
[Character(name="avg_npc_160_1#3")]
[name="Miarow"]There are Arts that can heal wounds, but they're a very difficult type of Arts to master.
[name="Miarow"]Before you can master healing Arts, you first have to have a complete understanding of medical science, you have to know the anatomical structures of all the different races, things like that...
[name="Miarow"]Also, most healing Arts users can only stop bleeding or speed up wound recovery. These Arts are very useful on the operating table, but in my experience they're no substitute for real medical skill.

[Character(name="avg_npc_160_1#3")]
[name="Miarow"]I have a little knowledge... not very useful though.
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#1")]
[name="Blitz"]That's boringly realistic... *sigh*.
[name="Blitz"]To think a world with magic could be so inconvenient.
[name="Blitz"]Hold up, did you just say 'sci-fi novels'?
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#3")]
[name="Blitz"]Now I'm extra curious what your world's sci-fi novels talk about.
[name="Blitz"]Would we find a bookstore in a bigger city? Maybe some history books too? Are books expensive?
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#2")]
[name="Blitz"]I've gotten myself all worked up now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]You're a weird bunch.
[name="Occphen"]Where are you from anyway? Columbia? Victoria?
[name="Occphen"]You talk like you're Victorians, but like from a couple decades ago...
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#3")]
[name="Blitz"]Well... I'm not really sure how to answer that one.
[Character(name="avg_npc_160_1#3")]
[name="Miarow"]Miss Cohen and her friends came from very far away. From a place where Oripathy doesn't even exist.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]What? ?
[Character(name="char_456_ash_1#5")]
[name="Ash"]...Yeah, that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]A country with no Oripathy? Really?
[name="Occphen"]No Oripathy, no Infected, that means no discrimination? A place with no hatred, where everyone's equal?
[name="Occphen"]Lordy loo. What kind of paradise is that?

[name="Blitz"]......
[Character(name="char_458_rfrost_1#1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]...Alright then. Your faces say it all. Just pretend I never asked...
