[name="Yato"]Its showing so much skin... Is this really supposed to be protective gear?
[name="Yato"]But... I do feel a strange tingling on my skin. And my discomfort from the light is gone.

[name="Felyne Artisan"]Look at that, Kirin set!
[name="Yato"]Kirin set? Is that what this is called?
[name="Felyne Artisan"]Mrow.
[name="Yato"]...I suppose I should ask Leizi about it.
[name="Felyne Artisan"]Terra meowterial's not bad! Good substitute.

[name="Felyne Artisan"](Whisper) ...Thanks, Originium slugs.
[name="Yato"]My new blades need to be tested in battle... Corne?
[name="Yato"]What are you doing on the ground?
[name="Noir Corne"]I... I tripped. Not used to this new gear.
[name="Noir Corne"]Wait, your mask...

[name="Yato"]What... What are you staring at?
[name="Noir Corne"]Nothing!
[name="Yato"]...Get up. We can't afford to be caught off guard out here. Get used to it quickly.
[name="Noir Corne"]O-Okay!
