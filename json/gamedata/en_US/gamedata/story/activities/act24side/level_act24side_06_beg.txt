[name="Noir Corne"]We all definitely understand that using Originium can cause Catastrophes.
[name="Noir Corne"]But... when Catastrophe strikes, if you want to survive, even if all you have nearby is a twig or branch floating in a puddle, you're bound to grab it.
[name="Noir Corne"]It doesn't matter if it has thorns... That's the least of your worries.
[name="Noir Corne"]Before nomadic cities were invented, before we started using Originium at the scale we do now, many more people died from Catastrophes.

[name="Felyne Scholar"]Terra... sounds so scary, mrow.
[Character(name="avg_npc_752_1#5$1",name2="avg_1030_noirc2_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Noir Corne"]Those thorns may end up cutting your fingers, but a Catastrophe's not going to end just because of your pain. You have no choice but to hold on... and hold on for dear life.
[name="Noir Corne"]And it doesn't matter how hard you look. Until you find a smooth tree branch that won't cut you, that's all you can do.
[Character(name="avg_npc_752_1#5$1",name2="avg_1030_noirc2_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Noir Corne"]It doesn't matter how difficult it all is. You just have to grit your teeth and live on...

[name="Felyne Scholar"]Noir Corne, I can hardly call you smart just for this, but purrhaps you have a point...
[name="Felyne Scholar"]Thinking about it now, the difficulties we face aren't all that diffurent.
[name="Felyne Scholar"]The materials we need to forge weapons that can take on the fiercest beasts likewise come from fierce beasts, and behind that must be a countless number of sacrifices too...
[name="Felyne Scholar"]There are Hunters who never return from their hunts, Commission members who fall while exploring the New World, and plenty of Scriveners who disappeared without a trace while observing dangerous creatures for data...
[Character(name="avg_npc_752_1#5$1",name2="avg_1030_noirc2_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Noir Corne"]*sigh*... looks like no matter where mew are, people are fragile, and the world is a cruel place.

[playsound(key="$MH_nekogood")]
[name="Felyne Scholar"]But even if all that suffering is inevitable, and you have to pay the price to survive, must innocent lives be sacrificed too?
[name="Felyne Scholar"]I've never heard of things like that where I'm from... Things like Originium which makes the innocent suffer.
[name="Felyne Scholar"]They don't catch Oripathy because they wanted to, and they won't even get to live without treatment. How could that pawssibly be right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_752_1#5$1",name2="avg_1030_noirc2_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Noir Corne"]Of course it's not right.
[Character(name="avg_npc_752_1#4$1",name2="avg_1030_noirc2_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Felyne Scholar"]Mrow! So quick to answer!
[Character(name="avg_npc_752_1#4$1",name2="avg_1030_noirc2_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Noir Corne"]Which is why somebody has to step forward and take on the burden of showing everyone else the way forward.

[name="Noir Corne"]Did someone just talk?
[Character]
[name="???"]Stop chatting! Look over here!
[name="???"]I've been stuck in here for three days now. Could you come over and move the stuff blocking this door?!

[Character]
[name="???"]Whoa, watch out! There's about to be another beast outbreak.

[name="Noir Corne"]Beast outbreak?
[Character]
[name="???"]You can more or less figure it out from the name, can't you? It's an outbreak of all the animals in the forest going berserk at once.

[name="Noir Corne"]I can hear it, too. It's not coming again, is it?
