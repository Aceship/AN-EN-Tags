In the end, the hunter didn't defeat the monster.
But the villagers had left, leaving behind only empty ruins to burn in the flames.
Wounded and without a target, the monster roared and bellowed, and returned to the forest on its own.
As though leaving with the parting words:
'I'll be back.'
The hunter stands quietly facing the forest. A long time passes before he answers.
