Noir Corne leapt onto the Rathalos, using his momentum to launch himself into the air.
As if pulled by an invisible wire, his body was hurled high up into the sky.
His energy accumulates, condensing into the smallest speck at the highest point.
And then—it bursts.
With a speed meant for thousands of kilometers, he slashes downward at the Rathalos's body.
