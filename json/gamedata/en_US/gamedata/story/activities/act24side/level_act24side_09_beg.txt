He kneeled on the ground, right hand still clutching the spear planted in the dirt.
His body was gravely injured, but he felt no pain, perhaps because it was pulsing from all directions and his aging nerves were too dulled feel it.
Or perhaps his skin was too scorched, to the point it could not comprehend the pain, the searing temperatures evaporating any kind of liquid or vapor, his blood instantly hardening to black scabs on his body.
His throat felt like it was on fire, with a strangely sweet scent emanating from it, and he suddenly felt a convulsion from his abdomen as something surged up.

Images from mere minutes ago flashed through his mind, and he seized the fleeting opportunity in-between the flames to hurl the spear towards the Rathalos's head.
He hit his target, but at the cost of failing to dodge the beast's retaliatory charge.

He leaned on his hunting spear, trying to prop up his body, but his knee would only stay at an angle.
The spear's shaft was sunk deep in the ground, and his shadow trembled violently.
