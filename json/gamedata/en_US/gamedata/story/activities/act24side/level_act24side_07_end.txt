[name="Noir Corne"]So, uh, planning on letting the rest of us in on this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#5$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]There's a railcar. We used it a lot when the mines were just opening, and it made things real convenient, but after the cave was repaired we more or less abandoned it.
[name="Mirai Takii"]Don't worry, it should still work fine. It was the very first thing I designed, after all.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#9$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]Weren't you an ecologist? I'm not sure I should trust your skills as a railcar engineer...
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]Kashiwau, our next battle won't be any easier, so I hope you're prepared.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Takii Kashiwau"]I don't suppose you'd let this old man loaf about for once?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#9$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]Please, by all means. I fully intend to respect your opinion.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]Oh?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]I'm aware that I tend to ignore the ideas of those around me and insist on doing things my way. And that this is a behavior I should correct.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]The mistakes I've made were precisely because of that, and I should also apologize for what I said earlier.
[name="Yato"]I'm sorry for my unproductive words, without knowing anything about your background. I did not intend to hurt you.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]Hm...
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#9$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#9$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]So will you accept my apology?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#9$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]Fine... if it pleases you.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]Good, then that's settled.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]Girl...
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]Earlier you said you understood me... what did you mean by that?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]Ah, that... It's a bit of a long story.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]If it's a bother, just pretend I didn't ask.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]No, I don't mind. You see, before joining Rhodes Island, I was an assassin.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#10$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]Nani?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]A literal killer, acting on orders to take the lives of my people, day and night.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]Until one day, I looked at my bloodstained hands and felt nothing but fear in my heart. The next day, I was tasked to dispose of a mother and daughter, but chose to protect them instead.
[name="Yato"]Because I didn't want to be a killer anymore. That was also the day I met Noir Corne, who listened to my story and chose the same path. 
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#10$1",focus=2)]
[name="、Yoshitaka Kashiwau "]......
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]But I'd made a mistake. It wasn't just a matter of refusing to kill.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]The pair I saved were so frightened of me that I could only leave them in a safe place. And while in the moment I felt only the weightless relief of not taking a life, I had forgotten something important...
[name="Yato"]That the only end awaiting them was to be killed by someone else.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#10$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau "]Do you... regret it?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]Yes. For a long time after that, I... often dreamt of them. They would ask me why I had left them to die.
[name="Yato"]I didn't want to hurt innocents anymore, but I still ended up indirectly cutting their lives short.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]...I used to wonder if I was even capable of protecting anyone at all.
[name="Yato"]Luckily, I had help... Thanks to him, I made my decision.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]You mean the boy over there?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]Yes.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]Heh.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]He scolded me—a rare occurrence—and said...
[name="Yato"]'The past is the past... All your remorse, all the sins you carry, make up for them with your future.'
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]I took him for just an oddball, but I suppose he's got a proper head on after all.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]What he said seemed right to me, and since then I haven't given it much thought.
[name="Yato"]We decided to make it our mission to protect others, and he dragged me along to join Rhodes Island. And because of our similar objectives, we're still working together even now.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name=" Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]This must be some company, to hiring on people like you.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]So protecting others is your way of atoning for your past?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]You might say it started like that, but I've had a few additional insights along the way.
[name="Yato"]I've seen too much life and death. There are many reasons people might surrender their lives, and some even seek death out of ignorance.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]You could say I stubbornly impose my will on others, but only because of my duty to protect your lives.
[name="Yato"]Life in this land is not meant to end so easily, but to be lived and experience all its possibilities.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]So I will continue my efforts.
[name="Yato"]I don't want to regret anything, or to see people forced to gaze only at ruins.
[name="Yato"]So I refuse to leave you alone.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#3$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]Yato! Kashiwau! We found the railcar and it's still working!
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]Hey, what're you both looking at me like that for? Is there something on my mask?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]It's nothing. We'll be right over.
[name="Yato"]Anyway, I look forward to cooperating with you in the upcoming battle, Kashiwau.
[name="Yato"](Holds out hand)
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]...No.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]I've told you this so many times already, that's <i>my</i> quarry.
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]You need only watch from the sidelines and applaud my brilliance.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]I'll just pretend I didn't hear that.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]......
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]The path you've chosen is not an easy one.
[name="Yoshitaka Kashiwau"]All I can do is wish you the best.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_755_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]Likewise.
