[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#1$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Four days ago, the Rathalos flew into the cave at night, and the miners changing shifts were scared away.
[name="Mirai Takii"]The flames it spewed also triggered a small explosion which led to a partial collapse of the mine, and thus sealed the passage to the village.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#6$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]No wonder there was so much active Originium dust...
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#1$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Mm, it doesn't seem to be doing so well itself. The huge amount of Originium dust has noticeably affected it. In particular it has difficulty feeding and an increasingly violent temperament.
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#2$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]I used an instrument to examine the dust in more detail, and could see a large amount of particles suspended around it. Every time it breathes fire, the dust is set aflame, causing great devastation... We're lucky it hasn't wrecked the mine yet.
[Character(name="avg_npc_752_1#6$1")]
[name="Felyne Scholar"]Noir Corne! That's why its flames are so pawerful!
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#3$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Ah, did you come across it while outside?
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#6$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]More than once, even... It's why we came in the first place, actually. It's been spreading Originium dust all over the village.
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#1$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]In that case, I must stress that if you want to deal with it, now might be the best time.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#9$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]Huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#1$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Because it's in an extremely weakened state, and though it can recover quickly, it will still take some time. Also, the mine has been overused to the point of becoming structurally unstable.
[name="Mirai Takii"]So if you just detonated bombs in certain spots, you could instantly collapse the entire mine.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#9$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]I'm a little worried about the Rathalos spewing fire while we're doing that, though. It'd ignite all the Originium dust and... Well, the consequences would be disastrous.
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#1$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Yes, but you have to trust me. As long as you follow my plan, it won't have a chance to open its jaws, let alone spit out an ember.
[name="Mirai Takii"]The only problem is that we don't have enough people to set up bombs in all the locations I marked on the map. We'd need at least one more, or it'll be virtually impossible to get it done by today.

[name="Mirai Takii"]Check my notes on page 237, in the bottom right corner.
[name="Mirai Takii"]I've done some research into the materials it leaves behind, and found out that it's not actually infected with Oripathy. Which means its changes were not due to the infection.
[Character(name="avg_npc_752_1#9$1")]
[playsound(key="$MH_nekotalk")]
[name="Felyne Scholar"]They're not? Then why does it have so meowch trouble feeding...
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#2$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]I doubt it's <i>completely</i> unaffected by Originium, but I still wouldn't say it has Oripathy... What's even stranger is that more and more Originium clusters are forming on its body.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#6$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]Uh, so... if the Rathalos isn't infected, the Originium clusters on its body might just be a temporary thing? And maybe it's not the one spreading the Originium dust?
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#2$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]That's my theory, but I don't have any hard evidence to confirm it. Besides...
[name="Mirai Takii"]The Rathalos's behavior towards Originium is also remarkably different from other creatures I've observed, and... it's really difficult to describe.
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#4$1")]

[name="Mirai Takii"]Huh? Me?
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#6$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]You came into the mine alone but with ample resources, before the Rathalos even arrived.
[name="Noir Corne"]You're very familiar with the place, but weren't with the miners when they changed shifts, otherwise you wouldn't have gotten stuck here.
[name="Noir Corne"]From my experience with the villagers and how sus they've been about the mine, I doubt they'd let an outsider conduct an ecological survey here.
[name="Noir Corne"]In short, I have some doubts about your identity.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#7$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]Not to mention your family name... it's the same as the headman of Roka Village, right?

[name="Noir Corne"]Mirai Takii, what exactly is your angle here?
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#1$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Oh dear. I wasn't trying to hide anything, but I suppose it was just a matter of time.

[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#1$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]I did omit a few details, like the fact that Ataru is my uncle, or that I actually snuck into the mine.
[name="Mirai Takii"]I also knew that you were from Rhodes Island, because I'm the one who left your contact information for my uncle to find. I'm assuming he couldn't handle the Originium dust the Rathalos was spreading, so he called you guys in.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#9$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]You left him our contact info? Why?
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#5$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Because I wanted to shut down the mine, and there was no way I could convince the entire village by myself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#2$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Originally, I was planning to contact you myself.
[name="Mirai Takii"]I figured that once you saw what was going on here, you'd do whatever it took to get the villagers away from here, right? Unfortunately, they confiscated my external communication equipment before I could.
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#1$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]So I thought I'd come down here on my own, and figure out how to destroy it myself.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#6$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]What made you so sure we'd evacuate the village? It wasn't even guaranteed that we'd stop them from mining... Also, I still don't know why you want to destroy the mine.
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#1$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Because if Roka Village continues to dig any deeper, this place will probably suffer a... a Catastrophe.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#7$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]A Catastrophe?! How soon are we talking?
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#4$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Hard to say right now, since at this point it's just an anomaly in the surrounding environment.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#6$1")]
[name="Noir Corne"]So the 'Mirai' we saw earlier was you leaving your mark after your investigation...
[Character(name="avg_npc_761_1#4$1")]
[name="Mirai Takii"]Yup. Then I assume you've been in a situation where it felt like you were just going in circles for hours. That's an effect of the anomaly.
[name="Mirai Takii"]The bad news is that said anomaly is getting even worse.
[name="Mirai Takii"]And I'm pretty sure our big boy Rathalos is heading the same way, though I haven't seen it do its flamethrower thing in its lair yet.
[name="Mirai Takii"]Of course, everything would be solved if you just went along with my plan.
[Character(name="avg_1030_noirc2_1#7$1")]
