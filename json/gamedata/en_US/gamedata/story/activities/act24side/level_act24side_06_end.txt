[name="Palico"]Mrow, so here's what happened.
[name="Palico"]The Hunter I was following had accepted a commission from a member of the Royal Family. They seemed to be in a bad mood, and were looking for a Rathalos Ruby to fashion into a brooch.

[name="Palico"]To return to my main point, I furst spotted this Rathalos in the forest near a volcano.
[name="Palico"]Right as I was about to catch up to it, I was suddenly swept away by a strange force, and by the time I had made sense of things I was already here.

[name="Palico"]I was still extremely unfurmiliar with the environment here when I arrived, so I chose to continue tracking the Rathalos and discreetly observe its behavior.
[name="Palico"]Based on what I've seen, it started behaving abnormally after it discovered a cave entrance and went inside.

[name="Palico"]Unfurtunately, it appeared to be a regular cave from what I could tell, but the Rathalos did start behaving strangely after entering.
[name="Palico"]I took a cursory stroll inside, only to find...
[name="Palico"]The cave network is purrticularly complex, and my several attempts to locate the Rathalos were all in vain.
[name="Palico"]My purrsumption is that it has occupied an area within the cave to build a nest, which should be a wide space near the entrance.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#3$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#5$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]Based on what we saw in the cave behind Roka Village, these caves should all be interconnected, so it's no surprise the Rathalos showed up.

[name="Yato"]There's one more thing I'd like to know. As you've seen, our previous fight with the Rathalos was not at all easy. In fact, you could call it... difficult.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#5$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]We've yet to effectively deal any damage, so I find it hard to be optimistic about our next encounter. I fear we may have to pay a considerable price for victory.

[name="Palico"]I understand.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]So what I want to ask... based on your knowledge of the Rathalos, how do we ensure a victory in our next battle?
[name="Yato"]Or to put it another way, is there any way to improve our chances?

[playsound(key="$MH_nekolow")]
[name="Palico"]It's hard to judge... Compared to a typical Rathalos, this one is highly agitated and shows a strong tendency to attack at the slightest pawvocation.
[name="Palico"]Earlier, I noticed that its senses have also improved, which is correlated with a change in its attack patterns. This is the basis for my assumption that its behavior is abnormal... Mrow.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#12$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Palico"]Neither of us have Flash Bombs nor Shock Traps in our pawsernal, so I am at a loss as to how to trap it.

[name="Palico"]I do have some ideas on how to boost the damage we deal to it, for I have observed... your meowjesty seems to lack instruction on the use of your Dual Blades?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]Dual Blades...you're referring to these strange pair of weapons? True, I do feel a lack of strength behind my blows when wielding them.

[name="Palico"]These pair in your paws seem to be weapons from our world, and of extremely good quality... So mew can at least rest assured they were crafted by one of our finest craftsmen.

[name="Yato"]Is that so...

[name="Felyne Artisan"]Mrow?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#8$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Palico"]I can explain to you the key to using your Dual Blades. If mew can manage to wield them correctly, mew will be able to deal substantially more damage to the Rathalos, but...
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#8$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]But?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#8$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Palico"]Before that, my observations have led me to ask the critical question: Is it truly necessary to hunt it?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#7$1",focus=1)]
[name="Yato"]You mean that we shouldn't kill it?
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[playsound(key="$MH_nekolow")]
[name="Palico"]My understanding is that pawerful Hunters are usually the key to meowntaining a balanced ecology. Hunting of any kind will have an effect, and the consequences must be carefully considered before any action is taken.
[name="Palico"]According to my observations so fur, the Rathalos's activity range is quite far from the village, so it does not pose a significant threat to them, and moreover... The ecology of this area seems to be quite unbalanced.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Palico"]The area is clearly overpawpulated by herbivores, judging from the obvious damage to the forest vegetation, so the Rathalos's ability to keep the herbivores in check could be considered a pawsitive.
[Character(name="avg_1029_Yato2_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_750_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Palico"]If I was back in my homeland and had already obtained my commission meowterials, I would not choose to hunt harmless meownsters.

[name="Yato"]To be clear, my mission isn't to hunt the Rathalos either, but to deal with another deadly threat—Oripathy. And our current clues point to the Rathalos as the source.
