[name="Yato"]We fought the Rathalos, a creature that has never been seen in these lands before. We know it's not something we can just leave alone.
[name="Yato"]More importantly... it may also be linked to another crisis, one that's more familiar to Terra.
[name="Yato"]Maybe you don't understand what I'm talking about, but we have evidence that we can't afford to waste any time in dealing with the situation.
[name="Yato"]Oripathy aside... a creature of that size that breathes fire and has venomous claws is a threat simply by virtue of existing so close to a village.
