Theresa holds the hands of the one before her, as if it were their first meeting.
She quietly faces the other pair of eyes, looking at the emotions shifting within until finally, only a void remains.
She knows then, every memory has been wiped clean, the soul purified.
[name="Theresa"]Your memory is gone, and your soul reborn...
[name="Theresa"]A truly terrible trick...
[name="Theresa"]But they underestimate your benevolence, your desire for victory. They underestimate us, and what makes Terra so tenacious.
[name="Theresa"]Doctor. Allow me to call you by this name for the last time...
[name="Theresa"]This is my little revenge on you.
[name="Theresa"]And also... my final gift to you.
[name="Theresa"]Memory does not shape who you are. So, with your original self...
[name="Theresa"]Live again... on this land. See the world, feel the various emotions life brings, meet the many people of Terra...
[name="Theresa"]Perhaps... your journey will start in suffering, and you may never manage to escape the murky moon shadows of this land, but you will always... get to see the sun rise.
[name="Theresa"]I trust you will find a new solution. One that is truly your own.
[name="Theresa"]An answer that... sounds just like the murmur Kal'tsit and I once heard...
[name="Theresa"]A most moving answer.

Life slips away.
Her ears gradually pick up an elegy from afar. Laqeramaline did establish a connection with her after all.
Theresa feels her own breath growing feebler, but she also feels unprecedentedly relieved.
She tries her best to keep Amiya in her arms, protected. Amiya's heartbeat calms her own.
[name="Theresa"]I'm... a little tired. It's exhausting, holding onto that crown.
[name="Theresa"]I should rest when I'm tired. Isn't that right, Amiya?
[name="Theresa"]I once imagined that...
[name="Theresa"]Perhaps, one day... We'll be able to let everyone on this vast land fall into peaceful slumber.
[name="Theresa"]It may take a long time to come, but maybe, you could see it for me...

Winter of 898, The King of Sarkaz dies.
Yliš dies and Kazdel falls into ruin.
The explosion of the Soul Furnace sends dust flying all across Kazdel's territory for three whole days and nights...
Finally, it falls to the ground like black snowflakes.
Burying the bones of the invaders.
Along with the ruin once known as 'Kazdel'.

Yliš, King of Sarkaz, rests here for eternity.
Underneath a massive mountain of corpses.
In the far future, not a single soul will know there was once a King who died here.
He was so mediocre, so ordinary.
The Sarkaz do not remember the defeated.
In this war that changed their fate, the people will only remember the names of six incomparably dazzling heroes.

With death as a witness—

[name="Theresis"]My blade will cut our path forward. And you will lead the way.
[name="Theresa"]...I understand.
