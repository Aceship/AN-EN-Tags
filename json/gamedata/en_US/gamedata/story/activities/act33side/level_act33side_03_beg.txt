It has been a while since Goodluck came back.
The city has changed a lot. People come and go. He is familiar with the words 'Babel' and 'Military Commission'; there are always people fighting over things that he does not understand.
He does not understand why the Sarkaz feel the need to fight one another.
He takes out the photo of the target, a mild-mannered young man. The triangular marking on his sleeve seems familiar.
A teacher spreading praise about Babel's outsiders, inciting opposition against the Military Commission.
'Sorry, your luck just ran out today.'

It has been a busy day at this old, ramshackle house, from the 'Teacher' to the multiple visitors.

Has father finally returned? And if so, what should he say?

He takes a deep breath, collects his mind, puts on a calm face, and opens the door.
