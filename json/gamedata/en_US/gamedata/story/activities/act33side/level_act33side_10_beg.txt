Theresa is glad to see Amiya asleep.
Amiya did not see the Doctor's betrayal, nor Theresa's final bout of sorrow.
The Black Crown finally lands neatly in Amiya's hands as Theresa takes down the final assassin in the room.

Theresa does not look at the one frozen in place before her. She gently pats the back of the child in her arms and leaves a kiss on her puerile cheek.

[name="Doctor"]Theresa. I can't throw away this opportunity I spent millions of lives and myriads of years to reach.
[name="Doctor"]I can't let you ruin the plan for Originium. I can't... let you turn this great land into a beautiful but fleeting dream.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#4$1")]

[name="Doctor"]...Seeing as the King of Sarkaz has already seen my memories, I believe there's no need for any further explanation.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#1$1")]
[name="Theresa"]You know it's futile... and yet you still wish to cure Amiya's sickness.
[name="Theresa"]Even if her family and homeland will all turn into the same hunks of Originium in the not-too-distant future, along with anyone and anything you'll ever know...
[name="Theresa"]You still don't want the girl before your eyes to suffer.

Theresa strains to stand up, stretching her arms towards the Doctor, instilling in the latter an instinctive urge to retreat.
The Doctor tries to move, but fails. Sorrow far surpasses the collapsing rationality at this moment.
Theresa touches the face beneath the mask.

[name="Theresa"]To trust in who you really are.
[name="Theresa"]To trust in our {@nickname} who brings the rain, dew, and sun.

This face is both familiar and strange. Theresa knows its features well.
She never had a chance to directly perceive the emotions on it until now.
She smiles and stretches out her finger, snipping the scene before her into two, as if it were made of cloth.
Then, she slowly pulls out a loose thread from the rift, and the remnants unravel as the Doctor's memories dissipate.

Theresa goes in deeper, without looking back, until every memory is taken apart into a mess of disconnected white threads.
Like the very night, a long time ago, when she was still young, teaching herself to sew with Theresis by her side.
The memories disintegrate until a mere fragment of the soul remains.
A silhouette stands at the end of that memory. Theresa thinks the figure both familiar and strange.
It's the Doctor. It's not the Doctor.
