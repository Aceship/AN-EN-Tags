The growth of Originium is silent, beautiful, calm.
All signs of life have been overgrown, civilization has vanished from this land.
But Theresa feels only fear and suffocation.
The memory is trembling, collapsing. There is a force somewhere, trying to fix an error.
The Originium in the memory continues to grow, even assimilating Theresa's consciousnessâ€”

[name="Kal'tsit"]Theresa.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I told you that Originium once decided the distant future of this land. There were two choices.
[name="Kal'tsit"]We were too focused on tangible suffering, Catastrophe, Oripathy. Casting our eyes toward that future brought too much difficulty and too little meaning.
