The bustling Scar Market has lost its usual commotion. Scattered mercenaries stow their weapons and stand with heads bowed in reverence.
In their eyes is silence, but the King of Sarkaz hears the voices of their hearts clearly.
Uncertainty, excitement, desire, anger.

One of the Sarkaz suddenly kneels.

In millennia of Sarkaz history, it has always been an honor for warriors to go to war with their Kings.
They have tasted struggle and glory, picked themselves up from the bloodied soil...
For the Kings of Sarkaz always stood in front of them, never abandoning their people.
Where the Kings point, that is where home is, where cities will emerge from the earth.

[name="Theresa"]A city of desire, a city of hatred, a city of wealth, a city of glory...
[name="Theresa"]You all believe you will plunder what you have longed for in that unfamiliar land.
[name="Theresa"]That's why I changed my mind. I decided to see Kazdel's bravest warriors off.

[name="Theresa"]You answered Theresis's call and dove into yet another campaign of hatred.
[name="Theresa"]Death awaits you far away from home.
[name="Theresa"]Yet you still choose to leave our home and go to Londinium.
The sorrowful King of Sarkaz walks among her people, who bow their heads to avoid her gaze.
Yet their determination does not waver, even if it means defying the King.
'We're going.' 'We're going.'
Voices rise and fall, as though the warriors are singing an elegy for themselves as they go to death.
[name="Unnamed Mercenary"]We exalt Your Highness, but we cannot follow you anymore.
[name="Decorated Mercenary"]The Regent promises that Londinium will be a new start.

The white figure passes through the parted crowd. The King's people are unmoved by her words.
They no longer follow the King they once exalted.
The other possibility for her people, the home full of flowers that she strived to build, did not come in time for the Sarkaz.

One speck becomes two, two become three, and many more emerge from the darkness. The first torch-carrying mercenary steps into the sunlight and sees the white figure standing on top of the hill.

The history books would record that the two Sarkaz rulers declared war on each other in the winter of 1091, causing open hostilities to break out between the Military Commission and Babel.
For the Sarkaz themselves, however, the civil war had begun in 1086, when isolated conflicts started to escalate rapidly.
The two centuries of peace that Kazdel had enjoyed have come to an end.
