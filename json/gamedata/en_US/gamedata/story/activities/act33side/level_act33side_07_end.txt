It could well be a rare fine day in Londinium, if it were not for the gun smoke filling the air. From atop the towering city walls, one can see the entire lay of this ancient city.
The General in his bloodstained uniform says not a word, his gaze fixed on the great edifice in the center of the city.
In the skies above Londinium, a dark cloud floats by.
