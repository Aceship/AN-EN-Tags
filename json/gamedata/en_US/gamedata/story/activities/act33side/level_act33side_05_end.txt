[name="Scout"]I'll keep going then.
[name="Scout"]We have twenty five hundred souls in the Catastrophe radius, mostly medics, Infected civilians, prisoners, and injured mercenaries.
[name="Scout"]The scale of the Catastrophe is larger than the Catastrophe Messengers predicted. It's currently expected to affect five outposts, three key passages, and a field hospital repurposed from an abandoned town.
[name="Scout"]They had almost made it out of the Catastrophe radius when their path was cut off by mercenaries.

[name="Scout"]It's not his style. The three Military Commission units have retreated from the forest, even leaving a humanitarian corridor open in one of the canyons.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1310_1#1$1")]
[name="Pith"]The Military Commission has casters on the cliffs, ready to annihilate any armed unit that attempts to pass through.
[name="Pith"]But they're not trying to hide what they're doing, and they're not doing anything we didn't expect.
[name="Pith"]These mercenaries are different. They came out of nowhere, attacked our positions, destroyed important roads and bridges, and polluted several water sources in the mountains with Originium explosives. There seems to be no reason with their actions.

[name="Ace"]Who's their employer?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1311_1#1$1")]
[name="Scout"]We're still looking into it, but based on what little intelligence we have, it's very likely that they're rogue.
[name="Scout"]Revenge, a last-gasp struggle after being abandoned by Theresis, instigation by another country... anything's possible.
