Odda runs through the burning streets, carrying the injured child in his arms, and pieces together the whole picture from what he sees and hears.
It began when an agitated teacher accidentally killed an agitated father, before he was set upon by the angry crowd and fell in the dust of the streets.
The turmoil dragged everyone in: Civilians, Babel, mercenaries, even the Military Commission.
Like a chain reaction, clouds of dust were stirred up in various corners of the city.
It wasn't until artillery from an unknown source blasted through a wall of Babel's office building that the Royal Court troops finally quelled the riot.
It began with an accident and ended with a shell that caused more damage to Babel than anything in the past eighteen years, since the end of the war.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4132_ascln_1#3$1")]
[name="Ascalon"]I-I've thought about it carefully.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1297_1#1$1")]
[name="Theresis"]Perhaps.
[name="Theresis"]Then follow Theresa and protect her, but don't blindly adopt her ways. Think for yourself. Manfred found his answer long before you did.

[name="Theresis"]...Nevermind.
[name="Theresis"]Go, Ascalon.
[name="Theresis"]There is nothing else for us to talk about now.
[charslot]
Ascalon falls to one knee, then turns to a mist that closes around Theresis.
The mist trembles and disperses, leaving behind only a stone knife in Theresis's hand.
He recalls the day that he snatched the blade from the child in the Catastrophe.

The Babel procession stretches as far as the eye can see, past the barricades formed by lines of Royal Court soldiers, past the disdainful crowd.
Theresis walks toward the crowd and stands with them.

Theresa joins the silent procession. Their farewell to the city is soundless. Their path is one of hope.
Then, something occurs, enough to silence the restless onlookers and momentarily halt the procession.
The cursing and crying cease. Every eye turns to a single, poignant scene.

A mercenary steps out of the line to embrace his best friend in the procession.
No one can hear the whispers exchanged between the two friends by the ruins of Babel, but all are willing to wait and give them their moment of farewell.
A farewell between the people and their city, and between two peoples of the same blood.
A young Sarkaz, who has lost everyone he holds dear, walks in the procession without regret.
He remembers walking the same path, leaving the city in search of his parents with his older companion many years ago.
[name="Odda"]Dad, I believe that there has to be another way than war.
[name="Odda"]Mom, I know you believed in Babel because you hoped for a different way to live.
[name="Odda"]Goodbye, Mom, Dad.

For Theresa's eyes only,
I have heard of what happened in Kazdel and share your sense of loss. The city holds special meaning to us all.
But Babel need not drift on the wastelands, for I have located the ship I previously mentioned in Rim Billiton.
The excavation went smoothly, and the ship's basic functions have been restored after two years of work.
It will carry the hopes of Babel into the future. Please wait for me, Theresa.
P.S.: I did find it on the ship.
A legacy that could bring upheaval to this land.
Given its importance, I feel it is crucial to discuss this matter with you in person.
With hope, Kal'tsit
