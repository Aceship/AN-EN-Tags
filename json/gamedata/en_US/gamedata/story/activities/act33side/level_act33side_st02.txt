This is the moment two civilizations make contact with one another, yet Theresa can see sadness in the eyes of this Doctor from eras long gone.
And she feels no warmth from the hands she is holding.

[name="Theresa"]You speak our language?
[name="Doctor"]I... learned... from... records. Not... hard.
[name="Theresa"]Unbelievable! I was thinking about learning your language. Kal'tsit said—
[name="Doctor"]My world... is lost. Languages of the past... should stay in the past.
[name="Doctor"]I... am curious about your kind. You found... and even entered... <i>Civilight Eterna.</i>
[name="Doctor"]I... want to... ask—
[name="Doctor"]Ask you everything about your... civilization.
[name="Doctor"]That's the only way... I can find traces of my world... the world of the past.
[name="Theresa"]...I understand.
[name="Theresa"]Hm, <i>Doctor</i>, Is that how you say it? Please forgive me. Keep holding my hands.
[name="Theresa"]I will show you—
The Doctor cannot help but be attracted to the eyes of this creature that looks like a devil.
Through her eyes, the one who lost a world sees—
