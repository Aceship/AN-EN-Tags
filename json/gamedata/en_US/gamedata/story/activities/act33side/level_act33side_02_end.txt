The storms rage, the young taunting the old.
The newborn storm slams into the dying storm to the war drums of thunder.
Roiling air currents clash and combine between the two storms...
Violence begets peace, and a passage appears where the storms converge.
Lightning flashes and thunder cracks.
[name="Theresis"]A path through the storm.
[name="Theresa"]The storm...
[name="Theresis"]Let's go, Theresa. The storm has given us a path.
[name="Theresis"]Those who survive through it will have another chance.
[name="Theresa"]We'll do it together.
The Damazti Cluster passes their command to every Sarkaz present.
The warriors see their leaders walk into the storm side by side and follow with no hesitation.
The procession advances into the tempest, the strong supporting the weak, the brave encouraging the fearful.
[name="Theresa"]Do you see that, Theresis?
Within the roar of the tempest, they seem to hear the voice from the snowstorm in that childhood dream.
They see—

[name="Theresa"]...The prophecy.
The thin, cloaked figure turns at the sound of her voice and sees the storm-bound procession.
Theresis sees a child. Mist, gilded by the setting sun, shrouds her shoulders, rising and blending with the shrieking winds above.
He takes off his gauntlet and stretches his bare hand into the mist.
The mist dissipates, and in his bloodied hand is the stone blade that the child is holding.
[name="???"](Slurring) Yew... argh! Gra... grab!
[name="Theresis"]What are you doing here?
[name="???"](Slurring) Hom. Yew... hom! Hom!
[name="???"](Slurring) Yew! Came in! Home!
The child wrestles the blade from Theresis's hand and points it again at Theresis and the procession behind him.
There is no difference between man and beast to the child who grew up in the wastes.
[name="Theresis"]You want to kill me?
[name="???"](Slurring) Keel... kill you!
[name="Theresa"]Nobody taught her how to speak. She simply emulates the sounds made by those who pass by.
[name="Theresa"]...Theresis?
Theresis looks down silently at the thin figure.
[name="Theresis"]Let me show you how to hold a knife.
[name="???"]...
[name="???"](Slurring) You!
The child hesitates for a moment, before putting her knife in Theresis's outstretched hand.
[name="???"](Slurring) ...Me. You! Bring, me... bring, me!
Theresis gazes into Theresa's eyes.
Prophecy.
'A sword to slay the regent king, a spear to pierce the royal ring.'
But they have never cared much for prophecy.
[name="Theresis"]Very well.
[name="Theresis"]Come with me. The home of the Sarkaz is not on the barrens.

[name="Theresa"]Maybe. But for now, what we should do is give the frightened child a little bit of peace. Do you like this city, Ascalon?
[charslot]
Compared to the armored general, Ascalon does not like this Sarkaz woman crouched before her.
She seems to see through all of her thoughts, leaving no secrets—a most dangerous thing in the wastes.
But she cannot bring herself to be hostile to this gentle Sarkaz.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1301_1#10$1")]
[name="Ascalon"]I...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#8$1")]

[name="Ascalon"](Slurring) Way? Probem?
[charslot]
Theresa says no more. It is difficult for a girl who has known nothing but the wastes to understand certain words, even with the help of the King of Sarkaz.
She takes Ascalon's hand.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#8$1")]
[name="Theresa"]It's like the wound on your palm. Weapons can't heal it. Only time and medicine can.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#8$1")]
