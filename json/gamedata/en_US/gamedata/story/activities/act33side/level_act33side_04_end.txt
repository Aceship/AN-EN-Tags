[name="Closure"]Even with the tricks you taught me, the encryption methods used by many of PRTS's programs are almost incomprehensible to a normal brain, and my decoder isn't fully compatible yet.

[name="Closure"]Leave it to me!
[name="Closure"]Seems like you're still keeping a lot of secrets, though.

[charslot(slot = "right", focus="r")]

[name="Closure"]Amiya's background comes through clean.
[name="Closure"]Her parents were killed when the convoy transporting the laser mining module got attacked. The attack itself was purely coincidental.
[name="Closure"]No one knew they were transporting Sarkaz-related cargo, and the Military Commission wasn't involved.
[name="Closure"]She must have gotten Infected in the mess. If not for the Doctor, she'd be spending the rest of her life suffering in Rim Billiton.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_003_kalts_1#1$1",focus="l")]

[name="Kal'tsit"]She's too young, and she hasn't had proper treatment since contracting Oripathy.

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_003_kalts_1#4$1",focus="l")]

A long trek through the Originium-filled wasteland leads to a small garden.
In the heart of a Catastrophe, amidst the ruins, on a nameless plain that neither night nor the stars can find.
Tiny white specks mark this little sanctuary, isolated from the rest of the world, and the wild lands around it. Even the winds seem softer here.
It is a forgotten greenhouse that harkens back to a time in the distant past, when the land was still pure and untainted.
Like when man stole fire from up above and lit up a corner of the night sky.
Theresa picks up a white flower.
[name="Theresa"]This place represents the cutting edge of Babel's and my research into Originium.
[name="Doctor"]Flowers...?
[name="Theresa"]No. Originium.
[name="Doctor"]—
[name="Theresa"]I'm sure you understand it's not Originium Arts that made these flowers bloom.
[name="Doctor"]The information inherent in Originium, the reversal of the Assimilated Universe...
[name="Doctor"]You've already come this far? When did...?
[name="Theresa"]No race understands Originium better than the Sarkaz. Still, what we know is merely the tip of the iceberg compared to the entirety of Originium.
[name="Theresa"]Even with Kal'tsit helping us understand the nature of Originium, the furthest we have gone is transforming a palm-sized piece of active Originium into this...
[name="Theresa"]Garden.
[name="Theresa"]Hope.
[name="Theresa"]This little flower is my small contribution. I need your help, Doctor.
[name="Theresa"]I want to see the day when flowers cover the cliffs and valleys of Kazdel, and all the lands beyond.
[name="Doctor"]......
[name="Theresa"]It's a future worth taking risks for.
[name="Theresa"]You've seen how Kazdel has been mired in war for its entire history, Doctor.
[name="Theresa"]Right now, at least, I want to use the power of Originium to create a home for Kazdel where people can live in peace, safe from war and invasion.
[name="Theresa"]In the more distant future... if we're able to fully harness it, we'll be able to change the entire face of Terra.
[name="Theresa"]If Catastrophes don't bring rain of Originium, but soft fluffy clouds...
[name="Theresa"]If the Infected no longer suffer the pain of rocks growing out of them...
[name="Theresa"]I don't suppose there's anyone who would have such an absurd dream.
[name="Doctor"]You're different from other Sarkaz, Theresa.
[name="Doctor"]Flowers that cover the entire land...
[name="Doctor"]What a picture of life that would be.

[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Theresa"]Oh... there's no particular reason. I just happened to come across it outside the valley when I was looking for a good place for my experiments.
[name="Theresa"]A pure coincidence.
[name="Theresa"]Kal'tsit said it had a name. 'Snow-in-summer'.
[name="Theresa"]But it's adapted to changes over the years. Perhaps we could give it a new name.
[name="Theresa"]What do you think, Doctor?
