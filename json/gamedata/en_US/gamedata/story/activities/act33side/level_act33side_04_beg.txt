Dear Kal'tsit,
Glad to receive your letter. Hope you and everyone in Babel are well.
A couple of months ago, I rescued a girl by the name of Amiya from a convoy that had met with misfortune.
The accident killed her parents and afflicted her with Oripathy.
The locals deal with orphaned Oripathy patients by putting them in a car and driving them into the wastes. I had no choice but to take her with me.
We have become fellow travelers by chance.
You can't imagine my panic and helplessness as I took care of her...
Fortunately, a woman who goes by the name of Savage has joined our little band, which has helped take some of the burden off me.

This should be an unfamiliar world, yet there are times when it feels incredibly familiar. I recall the legends that had fascinated me in the past, never failing to capture my imagination despite their age.

Savage has done her best to find medicine for Amiya, but my ability to treat Amiya's Oripathy is limited under present conditions.
I know that Amiya isn't special, by any objective standard. I know that Babel faces a crisis no less complicated, but I've decided to bring her back.
I met many people along the way. I've fretted over money at times, benefitted from people's generosity at others. I've seen new things, even some that surprised me for the first time in a long while.
The convoy that we were traveling with broke down. We found a herder to guide us through the wilderness of Rim Billiton on the backs of burdenbeasts, to the rumbling of drills and engines.

The Cautus's ears quiver at the mention of her real name. She glances at the Doctor.
A few months is neither long nor short.
True, it comprised only a tiny part of her lifetime, but it was also a span of a few hundred days, filled with countless unforgettable experiences.
Under the setting sun, before the sandbeasts, beneath the eaves. Upon this land.
She had enjoyed the journey, even if she never fully understood her quiet companion, and the many strange and curious ideas that companion had.
The Cautus who goes by the name of Savage sighs. What can she do? She is not as smart as the Doctor.
