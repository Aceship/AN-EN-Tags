[name="Scareye"]The war between the four superpowers has proven that other Terra nations can accept our existence as mercenaries, and that's where Scar Market comes in.
[name="Scareye"]And Your Highness surely knows that we've become a community, a town, because many of us could never fit into the elitist, bloodline-obsessed Royal Court.

Theresa doesn't reply. All she offers is a faint smile at the Cyclops.
Ah. It suddenly occurs to Scareye that this King of Sarkaz belongs to no Royal Court and represents no bloodline.
Her sole aim is to persuade the Sarkaz who are unwilling to believe that Kazdel can be built, some of whom have even committed crimes for this cause, to believe once more.

He stands prominently in the crowd, watching as the blades take the light from the mercenaries' eyes.
Still, no one fights back.

This is not the first Theresis has heard of her idea.
Apart from the Dame who left after helping build the nomadic city of Kazdel many years ago, he alone knows the true belief of the current King of Sarkaz.

Kazdel—a strange yet familiar name.
Many from this great land see it as the pit from which devils crawl—a terrible place to be avoided at all costs.
While to the Sarkaz, the name only evokes equally conflicted emotions.

[name="Timid Slave"]It never struck me on the way out just how high this wall is... Oh well, at least I can go home alive now. That means I'm pretty lucky.
[name="Timid Slave"]That man in the Scar Market... that was General Theresis. The first of this city's founders, the hero of that legendary campaign.
[name="Timid Slave"]*sigh* If I had the courage to ask him to take me in, maybe I could've just...
[name="Timid Slave"]*sigh*... I'm dreaming again.
He sits atop the high wall, experiencing for the first time a new lease on life.
Few of Kazdel's civilian Sarkaz, save for those children who haven't yet cottoned onto the fear of death, ever climb onto the city wall.
If the tremendous pipes and tubes piled high can even be called a wall.
The intricately tangled 'forest' of Originium spikes can take the lives of anyone who loses their footing, but it also serves as a haven for pilferers and mercenaries to stash their goods.
Smugglers and vagrants cross through the dark underground, peeking out from the tunnels and drains at mines and factories, scuttling from one corner of the city to another.
The life the slave once knew.
[name="Timid Slave"]The General gave me a fresh start. So what should I do from now on...?
He gazes at the furnace, burning and smoldering far away, teeming with indiscernible workers as they carry Originium, steel, dirt and stones into its hearth. 
To Kazdel the nomad, its flames bring motion, while the molten metal that flows out adds new appendage to the city.
For a whole century, it's belched its incessant black smoke. None know whether it's ash or Originium dust. Some say it's the bitter anger and anguish as the revenants exhale their last breaths.
Witchcraft altars hang high in the sky, intermittently flashing their blinding rays. The slave has heard many different versions of their urban legend.
The most frightening version claims that the Royal Court's casters work day and night on the altars, watching everything and listening to every conversation in the city.
[name="Timid Slave"]Maybe I can try my luck at the factories, too.
[name="Timid Slave"]It doesn't matter what else... I've made it back alive.
[name="Timid Slave"]It's been months since I left. I don't know how many of my friends are still alive...
