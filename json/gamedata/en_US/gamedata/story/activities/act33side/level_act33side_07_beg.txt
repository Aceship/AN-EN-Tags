[name="Doctor"]......
[name="Doctor"]While I slept, the ruins of our homeland nurtured new life.
[name="Doctor"]Originium is what guides their development, reshaping the lifeforms from Talos-II to have a similar appearance to us.
[name="Doctor"]I am rather fortunate. I have been able to leap across the millennia to communicate with them. I have even considered myself one of the people of this land for a time, experiencing their past and future.
[name="Doctor"]But in the end, I am not of here. I have even begun to feel... uneasy about Theresa's efforts.
[name="Doctor"]If the Originium Project ends in failure, no, even if it is merely postponed for some time... Theresa, Kal'tsit, even the future that I promised to Amiya...
[name="Doctor"]The inhabitants of this planet, some of the few lifeforms known to us, are but illusions that will break at the slightest touch.
[name="Doctor"]I have been lying to them and to myself for a very long time now. But... how will I explain it to Kal'tsit? Or to Theresa, or Amiya?
[name="Doctor"]Am I supposed to tell them that all the pain they have been through is the key to their salvation, and they must stop fighting?
[name="Doctor"]That all of Terran civilization is a fleeting dream, and only by being assimilated into Originium will we have the opportunity to avert our fate?
[name="Doctor"]Seeing the lives of those they call the Infected dissipate like smoke brings pain to my heart.
[name="Doctor"]It has long been a common sight on Terra, but it always marks the end of life—sorrowful and cruel.
[name="Doctor"]It has been too long since I've heard a voice full of life. I can't just see them as unexpected sparks.
[name="Doctor"]But what I see cannot be called a warrior's death.
[name="Doctor"]Rather, they have given in to the Originium's assimilation, passing through death to join the Assimilated Universe, a chance where life can break through the deepest darkness.
[name="Doctor"]Should I bow in silence at their deaths...? Or should I quietly rejoice at the smooth progression of the project?
[name="Doctor"]It is for this reason that Theresa dedicates herself to her research. Kal'tsit, our AMa-10, has also chosen to believe in the potential of Terra, chosen to resist Originium and put an end to war...
[name="Doctor"]But what about me?
[name="Doctor"]The Originium Project was built upon the efforts of countless generations, and in that time, billions of our compatriots have died, all in exchange for a mere ten thousand years that I have spent waiting and waiting.
[name="Doctor"]And now, the flint and tinder are in my hands. After all the long years. How could I abandon it?
[name="Doctor"]Because Terra has left me pleasantly surprised in a few short years? Because of the choices that Theresa and Kal'tsit made?
[name="Doctor"]Even if Amiya has moved me to compassion, would I not have been the selfish one all along?
[name="Doctor"]They... awakened me to be their salvation, but in truth, I am destined to bring them to annihilation.
[name="Doctor"]They awakened me, their destroyer, as if I were their savior...
[name="Doctor"](Chokes back tears)
[name="Doctor"]Amiya... Kal'tsit...
[name="Doctor"]What should I do?
[name="Doctor"]Priestess... What should I do?

Statues raised to commemorate the founding of the nomadic city of Kazdel by a pair of twins.
Even after a hundred years, his stone self still stands, sword drawn, by her side, despite the best efforts of Catastrophe and storm.
[name="Theresis"]Not long after she had crushed the rebellion that sought to destroy the new city, the joyful people of Kazdel invited us to witness the unveiling of these two statues.
[name="Theresis"](Ancient Sarkaz language) <i>Heroes.</i>
[name="Theresis"]They were to watch over the border we had marked with our own two hands for generations to come, warning our foes, welcoming our friends.
[name="Theresis"]I once swore an oath to her below her statue. My sword would behead all who stand against her.
The Doctor stares at the statue of Theresis, gaze unbreaking.

The shallow puddles below ripple as falling drops strike them.

[name="Doctor"]Very far.
[name="Theresis"]You have broken the witchcraft cipher created by Manfred's team that he's so proud of.
[name="Doctor"]I did that a long time ago. I just never told anybody.

[name="Doctor"]You already know. There are no surprises here. Considering the near two hundred years you and Theresa spent working together, you should be able to guess.
[name="Doctor"]I seek... the expansion of Originium.
[name="Doctor"]Babel's struggles will only prolong the dying gasps of this land, Theresis.
[name="Doctor"]No matter if you resist it or accept it, Originium will take on myriad forms, drawing all of civilization into her embrace.

The rain intensifies. The Doctor draws tight that trademark hood, and stands below the towering statues.
The shadows of the statues envelop the Doctor, making this figure seem ever more insignificant.
Theresis suddenly feels that the one standing before him in the rain is even harder to read than before.
[name="Doctor"]The burden I bear is greater than the future of the Sarkaz. If I must destroy some things to create a ladder I hope for...
[name="Doctor"]I will do it. It's all I can do.
[name="Doctor"]I've already hesitated for far too long.
[name="Theresis"]Destroy some things, to create a ladder...
[name="Theresis"]You speak lightly of sacrifice.
[name="Doctor"]Nothing light here, Theresis.
[name="Doctor"]Believe me when I say, you couldn't even conceive of what I've been through.
[name="Theresis"]......
[name="Theresis"]And where do I see your sincerity for our cooperation?
[name="Doctor"]Is <i>the Shard</i> not enough for you? Otherwise, even with the help of the Confessarii, you—
[name="Theresis"]It is not. It is far from enough, evil spirit.
[name="Theresis"]It is only enough to spare your life. Only enough to stop me, leader of the Military Commission, from killing a fated foe here and now.
[name="Theresis"]I require an even more direct means to advance this war to the next stage.
[name="Doctor"]......
[name="Theresis"]If you wish for the Babel members to be spared, then so be it.
[name="Theresis"]The Military Commission promises you that as long as Babel concedes defeat and departs Kazdel, we will not exterminate those who desert or surrender.
[name="Theresis"]But you know what you must do in return.
[name="Doctor"]No... You can't...
[name="Theresis"]Who would have thought that the evil spirit, who so roused the interest of the Nachzehrer King, would be such a coward?
[name="Theresis"]You can't both let Theresa live and allow the Babel members to leave safely; it's a total contradiction.
[name="Theresis"]Only with the destruction of Babel and the complete eradication of its members can Theresa leave for Londinium with me.
[name="Theresis"]Otherwise, it would merely be a case of the Military Commission quashing and dispersing yet another group of civilians, migrants, and pacifists.
[name="Theresis"]Even without my order, such things will happen naturally.
[name="Theresis"]Perhaps you believe that Theresa would be willing to step back and watch it before her eyes? She will not. And so she will resist.
[name="Theresis"]You know what I ask of you. If you truly wish to save the many who stand by your side, make them willingly admit defeat and surrender to me...
[name="Theresis"]Then slay their king.
[name="Doctor"]......
[name="Theresis"]And then, I will allow Babel to leave. As it collapses, it will no longer be considered a Sarkaz endeavor, and it will grow weak, drifting to the edges of civilization.
[name="Theresis"]'Destroy some things to create a ladder', {@nickname}.
[name="Theresis"]......
[name="Theresis"]You're right. There is nothing light about this.
[name="Doctor"]......
[name="Doctor"]In your opinion, what is the meaning behind this civil war? What meaning would her death hold?
[name="Theresis"]Reclaiming our lands, rebuilding our homes, ending discrimination, and revitalizing our race. You will have heard these platitudes many times.
[name="Theresis"]They are too complex, and yet too simple.
[name="Theresis"]Merely a small and pitiful species trying to grasp their fate.
[name="Doctor"]I see.
[name="Doctor"]In that case, I will tip the scales of destiny.
[name="Doctor"]Destroy Babel, divide them, weaken them. Allow them to return to their former lives, so that they can know a moment of peace in the final century.
[name="Doctor"]That way... we don't have to kill Theresa. Or at the very least, we can minimize the loss of life.
[name="Theresis"]Fretting over violence serves only to stifle you. You understand the Sarkaz better than most, but perhaps still not well enough.
[name="Theresis"]I have a question myself, Dr. {@nickname}.
[name="Theresis"]Evil spirit of a bygone age, you who call yourself a giant, a god, a supreme creator, one who can dictate the fate of the Sarkaz. Are you the only one of your kind?
[name="Doctor"]...I am.
[name="Theresis"]That is good to know. Go, now, without guilt, and do what you have decided to do.
[name="Theresis"]If you worry there will be no one to tear you down from your lofty heights, or judge your sins. Don't. I will do it, evil spirit.
[name="Theresis"]Until there are none left to toy with our fate.

The Doctor listens to the splashing of the puddles behind, the sound of footsteps fading into the distance.
Theresis is gone, wishing to stay not a moment longer.

Pale sunlight begins to seep through the gaps between the statues.
The Doctor cannot feel the slightest bit of warmth from it.
The heroes continue to gaze into the distance. They do not look beneath their feet.
There stands a figure who does not leave for a long, long time.
