Erasing memories. This is something Theresa actually lacks experience in.
Not to mention she now faces a rare kind of mind.
She knows not what she will see, and has no clue if it will be dangerous. But there is no room to retreat.
She has made the final decision of her life.
She walks into the Doctor's memories, and cuts them up into countless fragments of dissipating threads.
Memory fades away in silence.
She walks through a world she has never seen and could never understand.
How did such a glorious civilization meet its end?
How do geniuses as bright as shooting stars struggle for a solution to their ultimate problem, yet find nothing?
Is resistance futile? Is unity a mere fantasy?
Is Terra's future already set in stone? What of her beloved homeland?
What of her loved ones?
She has no answer. She cannot find the answer.
She can only continue meandering in the void of memories gone.
