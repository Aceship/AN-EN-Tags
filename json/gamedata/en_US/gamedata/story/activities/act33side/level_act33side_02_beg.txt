[charslot(slot = "left", focus="l")]
[name="Amiable Official"]It was the Kurfürst who wrote it, inspired by His Holiness's visit to Wasserland when he was still a Messenger for Laterano.
[name="Amiable Official"]The young and enthusiastic future pontiff told the children about all that he has seen... the ocean that Iberia watches over, the city of Athenius, where Minoan myth and machination exist in equal measure.
[name="Amiable Official"]And... a passing mention of Kazdel, the city of sin, the whereabouts of which are unknown.
[name="Amiable Official"]The Kurfürst was there, and he was fascinated by His Holiness's descriptions.
[name="Amiable Official"]The first draft of this work was in fact written at that time, but the Kurfürst was not satisfied. Even after many years of revisions, a final draft has yet to be completed...
[name="Amiable Official"]Until recently, when our scouts located the elusive nomadic city of the devils and sent back photos.
[name="Amiable Official"]Gazing upon the enormous tracks left behind by the city, the Kurfürst found the missing element in the music—ferocity. With that, the work was complete.
[charslot(slot = "right", focus="r")]
[name="Lateran Cleric"]You found Kazdel?
[charslot(slot = "left", focus="l")]
[name="Amiable Official"]Yes. The Kurfürst was astonished to find that the destiny of the work was intertwined with the city's.
[charslot(slot = "right", focus="r")]
[name="Lateran Cleric"]I understand the reason the Kurfürst chose to present this piece on the eve of my return to Laterano.
[name="Lateran Cleric"]However, unlike his predecessors, His Holiness has no intention of initiating offensive action against the Sarkaz.
[name="Lateran Cleric"]He is not interested in putting the sinless on trial without cause. I'm afraid I must disappoint the Kurfürst.
[charslot(slot = "left", focus="l")]
[name="Amiable Official"]The city itself is of no concern to the Kurfürst. He is far more interested in His Holiness's opinion of the piece.
[name="Amiable Official"]Please send His Holiness the Kurfürst's warmest regards.
