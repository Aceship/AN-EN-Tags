[name="Theresis"]How can the Sarkaz speak of unity while you continue to indulge in your noble bloodlines? Will it come from the 'rule' of the Royal Court?
[name="Theresis"]You may still rule over your own court, and maintain the power and prestige you hold among the Sarkaz, but the Vampire Court must yield to the Military Commission.

[name="Theresa"]Kazdel cannot escape it.

[name="Theresa"]High-efficiency command systems made possible by Originium Arts, high-speed battleships that can break through front lines, maneuver tactics that can mobilize entire legions... new advancements are applied to the battlefield as we speak.
[name="Theresa"]Their capacity for destruction is surpassing our innate instinct rooted in our bloodlines.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1297_1#1$1")]
[name="Theresis"]What worries me more is the fact that we will still find fellow Sarkaz among the countless casualties of war.
[name="Theresis"]Gaul employed Royal Court casters and the Liches in Leithanien are killing each other in battle, while a certain Wendigo is spilling the blood of his fellow Sarkaz to prove his loyalty to the Ursine Tsar.
[name="Theresis"]As for the Sarkaz mercenaries sent to the frontlines as Arts fodder, they won't even be counted in any nation's casualty statistics.
[name="Theresis"]The Sarkaz massacre one another in wars we have no stake in, regarded as disposable goods to be abandoned without care by the leaders of those wars.
[name="Theresis"]For the sake of keeping pace with these changes, the Sarkaz must once again gather around the furnace. And if necessary...
[name="Theresis"]The power to dominate the war must lie in our hands.

[name="Theresis"]Let us remind them. Let us show all of Terra our history and legend that have been either forgotten or falsified.
[name="Theresis"]The Sarkaz are not weak. We do not need others to save us from our fate.
[name="Theresis"]On the contrary, we will dictate the fate of Terra. Dictate how this land should move forward.
