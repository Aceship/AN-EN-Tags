Ten minutes ago, Amiya was roused by a strange sound.
Babel is continually being maintained and renovated. It has already seen massive changes compared to when she first arrived at her new home.
'Maybe Closure is busy fixing things again?'
The Doctor left Amiya many picture books in her room, with illustrated stories she had never heard of before.
Her favorite is one that tells of someone who falls from the sky riding a fantastical vehicle, and the many adventures that come of it.
But she is not fond of the ending. The hero repairs the vehicle and has to return to the sky, saying goodbye to the children on the ground.
