[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4132_ascln_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Ascalon"]No. The Military Commission is no longer reliant on any one strongman. This is exactly what Theresis wants.
[name="Ascalon"]So, the best way for you to accomplish your mission is to cause a disturbance at the right time. It'll sow doubts among the Victorian dukes, and they can do the dirty work for you.
[name="Ascalon"]Londinium is the heart of Victoria. They've got nowhere to run. The city will witness the downfall of the entire Military Commission.

Julie does not reply. She strokes the name sewn onto her clothes with linen, feeling its rough texture in silence.
'Julie'.
She remembers how Her Highness would teach them lessons.
She is more used to killing people than learning things in a classroom. Although she would doze off as she didn't understand a thing, she knew in her heart that everything Her Highness said was right.

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4132_ascln_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Ascalon"]You could go and join Scout's team. I remember you have already applied for it.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1299_1#8$1", focus="r")]

Ascalon does not answer. It seems that Julie did not expect to receive one in the first place.
Julie simply gets up and leaves at a languid pace.
As though she was just heading off to get a bottle of top-notch wine.
Ascalon watches her as she walks off into the distance.
She suddenly feels like there is something unfamiliar about Julie, the same feeling as if she were unable to recognize her own reflection in the mirror.

She hears the assassin break out in laughter under her blade.
Only once he has finally stopped breathing does she peel off his mask.
Julie freezes. She thinks hard for a long while, before finally realizing the identity of the Sarkaz based on the marred birthmark by the corner of his eye.
His portrait had been circulated around the Scar Market's book of bounties before.
He had many aliases, but nobody knew what his real name was. He has been active for far too long, long enough to become the subject of boasts and quips from drunken mercenaries.
But the two horns that marked his bloodline and identity have been cut clean off, leaving eternal scars on his head.
