The last thing Amiya remembers is sleeping inside the black bubble.
Theresa gently cradling the bubble wrapped around her.
Telling her a story that she has already heard many times before.
[dialog]
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#1$1", duration=2, isblock=true)]
[name="Theresa"]Within the Desert of Despair live many terrible shadows, forever chasing after the little puppet who is seeking for hope.
[name="Theresa"]The black-cloaked shadows were the echoes of the oldest despair and sadness.
[name="Theresa"]If they catch you, you'll never escape them.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#8$1")]
[name="Theresa"]Within the desert, the little puppet met the king, who was covered in pure gold and precious gems. The king told the little puppet that if he went back the way he came, he would be given riches beyond measure.
[name="Theresa"]Despite the king pulling him back, the little puppet ignored the captivating gems, and pressed onwards.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#1$1")]
[name="Theresa"]But very soon—
[name="Theresa"]The black-cloaked shadows caught him. They kept throwing themselves at him, over and over again, near endlessly...
[name="Theresa"]'Bang, bang, bang'...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#3$1")]
[name="Theresa"]The puppet took out a long spear made of a needle and some threads, fighting the shadows, until finally, after knocking aside the shadows' sharp talons, he managed to escape.
[name="Theresa"]He ran as fast as he could until he reached a large river of tears. There was neither boat nor weeds, so all the little puppet could do was swim across.
[name="Theresa"]But as he soaked in the tears, he began to sink, until he touched the riverbed.
[dialog]

[name="Theresa"]He had failed.
[charslot]
Was this how the story ended? Amiya could not believe.
Maybe Theresa read it wrongly?
She anxiously wished for Theresa to change the ending of the story.

[name="Amiya"]Theresa...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", focus="n")]
[name="Amiya"]Can we... save the little puppet?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1296_1#8$1")]
[name="Theresa"]You wish to save him?
[charslot(slot = "m", focus="n")]
[name="Amiya"]I do. I... I really, really do.

All sound fades away.
The bubble obstructing Amiya's sight dissipates.
Theresa's figure becomes clearer and clearer—

Out of the corner of her eye, she sees dark red seep out of the black-cloaked shadows lying down on the ground.
Who are these people? When did they arrive here? Why are they lying on the ground?
Amiya had so many questions she wanted to ask Theresa. She did her best to open her eyes wide.
She sees a white dress stained crimson. She sees Theresa's bloodshot eyes.
Was Theresa okay?
Amiya wants to ask Theresa about her injuries.
But she could not make a sound.

[name="Theresa"]But you can, Amiya.
[name="Theresa"]You will walk along a difficult path. Just like the little puppet who tried to cross the river of tears.
[name="Theresa"]All I can do to help you is bestow this crown of black upon you.
[name="Theresa"]For ten thousand years, the limitations imposed by history led my people to misuse this crown.
[name="Theresa"]It has been stained. It has been bound. But it should not have been so.
[name="Theresa"]If we are to break this curse, to break fate itself... I need your help.
[name="Theresa"]Do you want to rewrite the ending?
Amiya wants to say 'I do', but she cannot utter a word.
She anxiously nods her head, thinking that perhaps she could help Theresa by saying yes.
Perhaps she could save her—
[name="Theresa"]Though there is not much strength left in me, it is enough for me to transfer its permission to you.
[name="Theresa"]I have sealed most of it away, so that its boundless information does not overwhelm your mind.
[name="Theresa"]......
[name="Theresa"]Forgive me, Amiya... for making you bear the weight of this crown.
[name="Theresa"]I thought... that I could be there for you much, much longer. That I could watch you grow up. That I could stand with you when you bravely faced your parents' passing. That I could hear you answer my question yourself...
[name="Theresa"]Your answer as to whether or not you wished to follow in my footsteps.
[name="Theresa"]But there's not enough time left for us, Amiya.
[name="Theresa"]I now selfishly consign this weight that I bear on to you.
[name="Theresa"]I am sorry, child.

Amiya tries to scream, but she cannot open her mouth, cannot move her limbs.
A black blade seems to penetrate her chest.
She ought to feel pain, but this blade leaves behind—
Only warmth. A warmth brimming with hope.
[name="Theresa"]Amiya. It is hope, and also pain.
[name="Theresa"]You will be confused. You will hesitate.
[name="Theresa"]But please, trust Dr. Kal'tsit. Trust that she will always stand by your side.
[name="Theresa"]She will help you dredge back up the secrets of survival.
[name="Theresa"]You can bear it, can't you, Amiya...?
[name="Theresa"]You have always been a strong girl. One that never ceases to amaze me.
[name="Theresa"]*sigh*...
[name="Theresa"]I am so very tired.
[name="Theresa"]Thank you, Amiya, for the joy you have given me, ever since the day we met.
[name="Theresa"]Now rest for a while. Sleep.
Sleep in peaceful slumber.
I will always be with you.
