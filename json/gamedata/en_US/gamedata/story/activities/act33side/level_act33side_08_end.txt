The twins stand shoulder to shoulder.
By means of the memories stored within the Black Crown, they walk along the battlefield of yesteryear. Just as it was in the past.
The two mixed-blood Sarkaz step off the King's collapsed chariot, walking toward the battle...
Walking toward the future.

[name="Theresis"]So is this where we part ways?
[name="Theresa"]It is. Here, where we joined hands to change Kazdel, we part.
[name="Theresis"]Even though you have been their King for so many years, at times... you are as you were back then.
[name="Theresa"]Back when we were still young, I would often prick my fingers as I was sewing, staining the robes I would sell. Do you remember?
[name="Theresis"]Yes...
[name="Theresa"]At the time, you were still a gloomy recruit, not allowed to wield a real sword, always dreaming of becoming a soldier of Kazdel one day.
[name="Theresa"]I, for my part, still did not understand why we had to hide wherever we went.
[name="Theresa"]But then came the day that the Royal Court took note of my work, and I got to meet Yliš. During that meeting, I summoned my courage to ask the King of Sarkaz—
[name="Theresa"]Where does our future lie?
[name="Theresa"]He had no answer, only bidding me to leave.
[name="Theresa"]Only once I saw our defeated troops return to their homeland in ruins did I finally understand. The answer I sought could not be found in other lands, but 'here'—
[name="Theresa"]—In 'Kazdel'.
[name="Theresis"]Kazdel will only return to glory when one of us is gone.
[name="Theresis"]But the one who is destined to lose is you. Must you persist with this, Theresa?
[name="Theresa"]There are many by my side who support me.
[name="Theresis"]Most Sarkaz who have suffered oppression and humiliation choose rebellion and violence.
[name="Theresis"]No matter if those who remain wish it or not, they will eventually be swept along by the tides and drawn into wars.
[name="Theresa"]But our generation must do something. I do not wish for this hatred in my hand to pass on to the next, where it will continue to fester and grow anew.
[name="Theresa"]Even if I cannot change the future, the hope that will ignite the spark must be carried forward.
[name="Theresis"]I too must take charge of those who follow me.
[name="Theresis"]The cries answering the war do not come solely from Kazdel. There is no place for us anywhere in these lands.
[name="Theresis"]All I can do is give them a push.
[name="Theresis"]And so I will stay here. I choose to stay in the past, where the new generation of Sarkaz will one day look back.
[name="Theresis"]Just like you.
