[name="Doctor"]Sorry, Theresa, but this is not something you need to take on.
[name="Doctor"]No need to use Civilight Eterna on me. It takes a toll on you too. There are more important uses for it.

[name="Theresa"]More important than helping someone who's given everything for us?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]Hehe... thank you. I mean it.
[name="Doctor"]You and Scout said we have some breathing room, right?
[name="Doctor"]I'll make dinner for us, then. I learned it off Misery.
[name="Doctor"]For our future challenges.
