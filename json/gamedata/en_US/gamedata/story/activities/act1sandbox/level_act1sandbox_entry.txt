We gather the remaining villagers and seek a place on the sands where we can settle down and live.
We have few resources left, the most important of which being our hands and an unbreakable will.
We'd led happy lives in the land of Sargon, with warm beds at night and rooves over our heads, until everything was destroyed by Catastrophe.
Peace does not belong to those outside the nomadic cities.
We were forced to leave the homes we'd lived for decades, where we'd made our memories. Only hope keeps us going.
We head towards a place in the sands yet untouched by Catastrophe, where life has begun to bloom.
One step at a time.
We overcame hunger, overcame parting, overcame roaming outlaws.
