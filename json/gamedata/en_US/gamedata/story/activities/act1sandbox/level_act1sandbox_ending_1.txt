As night falls, the people light a fire to celebrate.
Cries of joy can be heard everywhere, intertwined with songs of celebration.
People gather around the fire, the wood crackling in the flames.
Smiles can be seen on everyone's faces, illuminated by the light of the bonfire.
A new clan celebrates in this oasis.
