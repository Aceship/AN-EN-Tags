And seems like we all made it through in one piece. Let's head back to headquarters.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_trademan")] Hey, things are looking up!
[Sandbox.FocusModule(module="INSTITUTE_INNER")]
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_trademan")]I present to you the 'Sage', a mobile R&D unit, the pride and joy of our company! It can help you construct buildings and craft items.
[Tutorial(target="btn_sandbox_basement_car_build", animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_trademan", waitForSignal="sandbox_build_routed")] C'mon, take a look.

[Tutorial(target="btn_sandbox_build_back", searchBtnInChildren=true, waitForSignal="sandbox_basement_car_routed",          animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_trademan", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] We're just starting out, though, so forget about the advanced stuff for now.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_trademan")] Instead, here are some other things you'll need to know!
[Sandbox.FocusModule(module="COIN_INNER")]
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_trademan")] You've already found the Escape Route and established communications with the outside.
[Tutorial(target="btn_sandbox_basement_car_box", animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_trademan", waitForSignal="sandbox_black_box_routed")] If you're finding things too tough here, you can always pack it up and set out for your next home.
[Tutorial(target="panel_sandbox_show_item", animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_trademan")] You can also view the supplies you can take with you here.
[Tutorial(target="panel_sandbox_confirm_escape", animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_trademan")] Doesn't seem like there's anything... Must be the policy of those mercenaries. They only guaranteed YOUR safety, not your cargo's.
[Tutorial(black="$f_tut_black", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_trademan")] How do I know so much? Heh, you can't do business in a place like this without learning a thing or two!
[Tutorial(black="$f_tut_black", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_trademan")] A shame, but I respect your decision... Here's hoping we meet again.
