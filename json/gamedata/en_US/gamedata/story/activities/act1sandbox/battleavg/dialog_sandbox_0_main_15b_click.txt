[name="Emilia"]Your presence here reminds me... reminds <i>us</i> of how things used to be.
[name="Emilia"]It was peaceful, happy. We didn't have much, and the people in the black market looked down on us, but we were all here.
[name="Emilia"]Nothing had happened yet when you first arrived. We built this house for you, hoping you'd give up the assassin's life and stay.
[name="Emilia"]......
[name="Emilia"]It's a good thing you came back... I think...

[name="Manticore Killer"]...I won't leave ever again.
[name="Manticore Killer"]I'll stay here with you... You gave me a house, a home...
[name="Manticore Killer"]I hated doing all that... killing people...
[name="Manticore Killer"]I want to stay here...

[name=""]Nothing happens for a while. We rebuilt our homes on this land.
[name=""]There are less of us, and less houses too, just a little plot of farmland to tend to. We and Manticore seem to have accepted one another.
[name=""]Most of us have turned our gaze to the present, but some could not let it go. They went off to find 'Sand Soldier' and brought back mercenaries of unknown origin, causing a rift in the clan.
[name=""]We begin to doubt... Was working with 'Sand Soldier' really the right choice?
