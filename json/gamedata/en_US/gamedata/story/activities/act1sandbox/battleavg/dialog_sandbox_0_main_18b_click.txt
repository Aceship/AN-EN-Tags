[name="Black Market Merchant A"]No need to be scared, we're just here to do business.
[name="Black Market Merchant A"]You've gotten all the good stuff up till now. But now that 'Sand Soldier' is gone, it's time you returned it.

[name="Black Market Merchant B"]Like I said, this is just business.
[name="Black Market Merchant B"]It's simple. You leave the stuff behind, and we'll tell you a route.
[name="Black Market Merchant B"]Walk away, and you get to keep your lives. It's a good deal.
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]Fight? Or flee?
[name=""]The arguments in the settlement have not stopped. Some continue to search for the 'Sand Soldier,' including Emilia, who took up her beloved's mantle and seeks to avenge him, day after day.
[name=""]But most of the inhabitants have gotten tired of fighting. They just want to live in peace.
[name=""]Now is not the time for hesitation though.

[name="Emilia"]Why?!
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]Because there are only a few of us left. Because we don't have the resources and strength we once had.
[name=""]Most of the people look relieved.
[name=""]They feel that as long as they have a home, there is a future. As long as they have their friends and family.
