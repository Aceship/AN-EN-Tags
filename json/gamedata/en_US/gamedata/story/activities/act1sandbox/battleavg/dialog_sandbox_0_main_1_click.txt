[name="Liaison"]Hey guys, we meet again!
[name="Liaison"]What are the odds?
[name="Liaison"]So what are you here for? Hunting? Mining? Must be a tough job.
[name="Liaison"]Anyway, remember me? I'm the local liaison from Sunvalley Industries.
[name="Liaison"]Just give me a shout if there's anything you don't understand, or if you run into any trouble!
[name="Liaison"]And hey, might as well browse our company catalogue while you're at it, am I right?
[name="Liaison"]So, what do you need?

[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]Well, obviously your best choice would be Sunvalley Industries.
[name="Liaison"]Our products are tried and true, not to mention constantly improving. They're also reasonably priced, high-quality, provide comprehensive after-sales service, and are guaranteed to meet your every need here.
[name="Liaison"]What do you think?

[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]...I see!
[name="Liaison"]We're really a great match, huh? It's like we've known each other for years!
[name="Liaison"]Tell you what! From here on out, we're partners! How's that?
[name="Liaison"]Let me tell you about the Reefsteep Black Market, the one in Ibut. It lies northwest of your Headquarters, and you can get just about anything there—if you have the cash.
[name="Liaison"]Hey, I've seen you around the settlement before. You sure look like you're in a hurry. What's the matter?
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]*Pant* *pant* Damned weather...
[name="Basil"]I'm back! We found quite a few places around here where we can hunt and gather. Let's go and collect some resources later.
[name="Basil"]Anything you need me to do?

[name="Basil"]Black market... I think I saw it on the way over.
[name="Basil"]The soil here isn't great, but it's enough for us to survive on for a little while.
[name="Basil"]Still, we're in Sargon, and it's only a matter of time before the tax collectors find us. And we can't afford to pay taxes.
[name="Basil"]...In the long run, the black market could be an option.
[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]Exactly! It's the place to go, whether there's something you need, or you just want to make a quick buck.
[name="Liaison"]Complete a few commissions or make a few deliveries, and you'll have enough to last you for a while.
[name="Liaison"]Especially—
[name="Liaison"](Whispers) Especially if you could earn the support of a certain someone behind the black market...
[name="Liaison"]They call him the 'Sand Soldier,' and he effectively controls the entire black market. Sadly, a lowly liaison like me has no chance of getting an audience though...
[Decision(option1="The black market... thanks for telling us.", value1="5.1", option2="Alright, we'll check it out!", value2="5.2")]
[predicate(references="5.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]Anything for you, partner.
[name="Liaison"]Sorry for keeping you. I'll let you get settled in and come back later.
[name="Liaison"]Don't forget! The black market's northwest of your Headquarters. My company has a little outpost there, too. Sunvalley awaits your business!
