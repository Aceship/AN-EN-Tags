[name="Liaison"]Oh hey, you guys are hiding here too?
[name="Liaison"]So what happened? I waited like you said, but then a bunch of folks came in... They were attacking even the Lord Ameer's people!
[name="Liaison"]I'd be dead already if I hadn't kept my head down, waiting for the signal! I saw their bodies hit the ground!
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]We arrived on scene and laid an ambush. However, just as the liaison said, a group of unknown mercenaries showed up, attacking everyone indiscriminately.
[name=""]Could it be that Venomfang didn't trust us, and chose another group to do his bidding?
[name=""]Silencing us in the process...
[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]Hey, say something!
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]The traps and cover that we laid beforehand had become our hiding spot. We huddle together, afraid that we would be next.
[name=""]The liaison trembles in fear in a corner. What is happening here must seem even more incomprehensible and terrifying to him than it is to us.
[name=""]I suppose we should tell him the truth.

[name="Liaison"]......
[name="Liaison"]............
[name="Liaison"]So you were just being used...
[name="Liaison"]If Venomfang ruined your fields, then he must also know that you came to me for help... It'd be one thing if we pulled it off, but we'd be dead if we failed.
[name="Liaison"]Who are these people then? Do you have any ideas? We should also get our stories straight in case anyone comes asking!

[name="Liaison"]What? Himself?
[name="Liaison"]...You might be right. Not many people would have the nerve to pick a fight with the Lord Ameer.
[name="Liaison"]What about us, then?! Why'd he have to drag you into this? And you tricked me too...
[name="Liaison"]Why'd he need us to deal with this lieutenant of his, when there are so many mercenaries and assassins he could have hired off the black market?
[name="Liaison"]......
[name="Liaison"]Er... I'm not sure if this is the right time to bring this up, but are we still doing this? Because if we don't... won't we, well, you know, end up like... them?
[name="Liaison"]Are we still going to find that lieutenant and— Bugger me dead, where <i>is</i> he?! I don't see him anywhere!
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]Come to think of it, we didn't see him either.
[name=""]Other than the liaison and the Lord Ameer's men, there were only a few faces from the black market.
[name=""]......
[name=""]Why wasn't he there?

[name="Liaison"]But that means we don't need to kill anyone, right? Just hide here, wait for things to blow over, and pretend this never happened, right?
[name="Liaison"]When they're satisfied that we'll take their secret to our graves... not to mention the money... they won't come for us anymore.
[name="Liaison"]Hopefully...
