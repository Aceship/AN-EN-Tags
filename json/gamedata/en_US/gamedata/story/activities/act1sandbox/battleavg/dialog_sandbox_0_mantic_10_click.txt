[name="Basil"]There! We need to at least clear this up before she leaves!
[name="Basil"]Is that the 'Sand Soldier'?
[name="Basil"]Why is she meeting him?

[name=""]Why 'Sand Soldier'?
[name=""]The Manticore killer has been operating under our supervision the entire time she's been here, and she's never made a mistake. She shouldn't have any connections to the 'Sand Soldier.'
[name=""]What happened?
[name=""]But simply going up to her and asking why she betrayed us won't yield an answer. We need another way.

[name="'Sand Soldier'"]Ah... you seem to have misunderstood.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]I never sought to manipulate you.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]In fact, I've always been helping you out.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]Have you never wondered how you managed to return safely to your settlement that night, with only a few hunters and a heavily-injured girl?
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]......
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]I'm happy to assist people like you. Take this. It'll come in handy.
