[name="Liaison"]Oh, so you've come to the black market too!
[name="Liaison"]What are the odds?
[name="Liaison"]So what are you here for? Buying something? Finding someone? Whatever it is, it must beâ€”
[character(name="avg_npc_007", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Shut your trap! Can't you see we're still talking?
[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]Huh? Huh...?
[name="Liaison"]O-Okay...
[character(name="avg_npc_007", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Now get out of my sight!

[Decision(option1="We didn't ask for this junk!", value1="2.1")]
[predicate(references="2.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_007", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Good question. I don't know.

[character(name="avg_npc_007", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Black Market Merchant"]I heard from Venomfang that there was a batch of goods set aside for you.
[name="Black Market Merchant"]It's been the same way for the last few transactions. He gives the tip-off, I tell you, you buy.
[name="Black Market Merchant"]As for what those people are selling, that's out of my hands.
[Decision(option1="Who the hell is Venomfang?!", value1="4.1")]
[predicate(references="4.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_007", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Black Market Merchant"]...You really don't know anything, do you?
[name="Black Market Merchant"]When you first came here, you dug up three ore veins, got your ore, and went home happy. Those veins belonged to Venomfang.
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Last week, you fought a bunch of mercs and took what they left behind. That stuff belonged to Venomfang.
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Need I remind you what you did a few days ago?
[name="Black Market Merchant"]You're lucky he only made you buy a bunch of crap, rather than hanging you out to dry into jerky.
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Haven't you heard? A few years back, someone took his favorite son hostage to try to threaten him. He simply killed his own son, then took out each and every one who was part of the plot.
[Decision(option1="We didn't know...", value1="5.1")]
[predicate(references="5.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_007", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Of course you didn't, which is why you're still alive. We wouldn't be having this conversation if you did it on purpose.
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Alright, so listen carefully.
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Venomfang wants to become a guildmaster at Reefsteep, but his lieutenant has different ideas. The Lord Ameer and Sunvalley are negotiating a deal at Redhorn in a few days, and the lieutenant will be there too.
[name="Black Market Merchant"]So help Venomfang get rid of his lieutenant and make the deal fall through. I can't guarantee who lives, but you get to keep the money, Venomfang will write off his grievances with you, and we can work together again.
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Also, he sent you this gift.
[name="Black Market Merchant"]Goodbye.

[name="Liaison"]Who was that? Guy had an attitude...
[name="Liaison"]Anyway, now that that loudmouth is gone, why don't you take a look at my stuff? I'm sure that'll cheer you right up.
[name="Liaison"]The latest products from Sunvalley Industries! Don't they look great?
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]...Did he not see that man threaten us just now?
[name=""]The merchant mentioned a 'Sunvalley.' Is this liaison part of the deal? Doesn't look like he knows anything.
[name=""]Maybe we could...
[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]This one hasn't hit the market yet! Even its unique appearance is a Sunvalley trade secret.
[name="Liaison"]But we're not strangers, partner. We can give you a special early-access offer!
[Decision(option1="What's this? Is it legit?", value1="9.1")]
[predicate(references="9.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]Of course it is! It's the result of our researchers' blood, sweat, and tears. I can even thrown in a further discount... here!
[name="Liaison"]How's that? Piqued your interest?
[Decision(option1="Maybe if it was half that.", value1="10.1")]
[predicate(references="10.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]Huh? Half? No, that's way too low...
[name="Liaison"]But, let me think... profit, cost, sales targets, my pay...
[name="Liaison"]......
[name="Liaison"]O-Okay... it's a deal!
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]Wow, that was quick.
[name=""]Real flexible, isn't he?
[Decision(option1="Come to think of it, that's still a little expensive.", value1="11.1")]
[predicate(references="11.1")]
[Decision(option1="Maybe another 50% off.", value1="12.1")]
[predicate(references="12.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]What? No, absolutely not!
[name="Liaison"]They'll cut my pay!
[Decision(option1="Forget it then.", value1="13.1")]
[predicate(references="13.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]Suit yourself!
[name="Liaison"]How am I supposed to do business when you're being like this?
[Decision(option1="(Turn around and leave)", value1="14.1")]
[predicate(references="14.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_803_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Liaison"]......
[name="Liaison"]W-Wait, you're really leaving? Wait!
[name="Liaison"]Alright, alright! Fine! Another 50% off!
[name="Liaison"]The company wouldn't even pay for my burial if I starved to death here. At least this way I'll get to eat...
[name="Liaison"]A pleasure doing business... No exchanges or refunds...
[name="Liaison"]Well, er, have a nice day...
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]So not only is he flexible, he also has some clear weaknesses to exploit.
[name=""]But he does seem quite familiar with the area.
[name=""]The deal involves Sunvalley, and Venomfang seems to know us in and out. We have to do it.
[name=""]Maybe he can help us complete Venomfang's request.
