[name="Treasure Hunter"]There you are!
[name="Treasure Hunter"]I've managed to decipher the text on the treasure map.
[name="Treasure Hunter"]Not only that, I discovered hundreds of new words in a language we had almost no records from!
[name="Treasure Hunter"]The text on the back is a saga revealing that it was once owned by a wealthy tribe, and points to treasure passed down through the generations.
[name="Treasure Hunter"]It's not clear how the map left their hands, though. Could be Catastrophe, could be war, there was even mention of the 'Nightzmora'!
[name="Treasure Hunter"]Maybe it'll help me find my dad as well...
[name="Treasure Hunter"]No, I've gotta stop thinking about him... <i>He</i> was the one who left without a word!

[name="Treasure Hunter"]Sorry, I get excited when I think about my job...
[name="Treasure Hunter"]Anyway, now that the map is solved, I'll take you to the marked location.

[name="Basil"]To be honest, a lot of us aren't expecting much from this, but I figure it's worth a shot.
[name="Basil"]At the very least, we could do some hunting and mining on the way so we don't come back empty-handed.
[name="Basil"]Plus, the Lord Ameer's tax collectors are coming soon, and we need to be ready!

[name="Treasure Hunter"]I've made a list of things you'll need. You should be mindful of your stamina, too.
[name="Treasure Hunter"]After all, no one ever said treasure hunting was easy!
