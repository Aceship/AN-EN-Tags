[name=""]'Sand Soldier'? What's he doing here?
[character(name="avg_npc_801_1", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]Oh, it's you.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]Don't worry, they were just some soldiers hired by the Lord Ameer. A previous transaction has caught my attention, though.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]I appreciate your assistance. It's no easy thing to triumph over a group like this.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]But I'm curious. Did you know who was behind these people before you did what you did?

[name="'Sand Soldier'"]Ah, then you are truly brave.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]It was a regiment under Ibut's Lord Ameer. You haven't stopped him, only delayed his progress in exploring this land.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]Oh, but no need to worry, they don't know who you are. No doubt they assumed you were mercenaries under my command.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]And they don't know who I am either.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]Still, there are things that you should be aware of.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]As a rising faction in Ibut, one strong enough to defeat a regiment, you are drawing the attention of the Lord Ameer.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]If you feel that you're strong enough, and you want to fight the lord head on...
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]Then, maybe, we can discuss it.

[name="'Sand Soldier'"]A brave choice.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]I'll await you at the Reefsteep Black Market.

[name="'Sand Soldier'"]......
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]A natural response. There's no need for you to go that far.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]But there's also no need to deny yourselves the joy of today's hard-won victory.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]A fledging young faction defeated the Lord Ameer's regiment. You should go back to your settlement and celebrate.
