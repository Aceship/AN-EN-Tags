[name="Manticore Killer"]Go... I'll take the rear!

[name=""]...*Hiss*!
[name=""]You take a hit from behind and black out.
[name=""]Who is it this time? The Lord Ameer's men again?
[name=""]Someone seems to be shaking you...
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]Wake up, wake up...
[name="Manticore Killer"]They're not gone yet, wake up...

[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]Thank goodness...
[name="Manticore Killer"]They're the Lord Ameer's mercenaries... They said we've been living on the land without paying tribute to the lord...
[name="Manticore Killer"]It's the land of the King of Kings... We're not the masters of the land, so we need to obey...
[name="Manticore Killer"]They're still here... I've seen them at work... The Lord Ameer doesn't care how many in the settlement die, and neither do they... We need to go back...
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]I think I took a bad hit. I can't move.
[name=""]I can't see how many mercs there are, or where we are.
[name=""]But things could be worse—
[Decision(option1="Your ability is to be inconspicuous, right?", value1="3.1")]
[predicate(references="3.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]

[name="Manticore Killer"]What should I do...?

[name="Manticore Killer"]Understood...
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]Four hours turns to five, then six... We waited a long time.
[name=""]It should have been more than enough time to reach the settlement and return.
[name=""]There are no voices around, not even the sound of sand rustling.
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]...Something's not right. Why hasn't anybody come?
[name="Basil"]Did you see who attacked us? Everything we know about the attackers came from her.
[name="Basil"]With our injuries, we could die of hypothermia after sundown!
[name="Basil"]It's time to make a choice.
[Decision(option1="Our wounds are all wrapped up. I think I can move...", value1="6.1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]There's no one? What about those mercs the Manticore killer mentioned? Did they leave? And why let us go?
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]Were there any mercenaries to begin with?
[name=""]We even told her the code word so the others would believe her.
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]...Did we put too much trust in a killer?
[name="Basil"]......

[name="Villager"]Over here!
[name="Villager"]Give me a hand!
[Decision(option1="(Ask what is going on)", value1="9.1")]
[predicate(references="9.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_071", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Villager"]Send back word that we found them!
[name="Villager"]The Manticore? She's behind us. Passed out on the way, muttering something about saving you guys. We got delayed because we were relying on her to guide us.
[name="Villager"]Anyway, I'm so glad we found you.
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]*cough*...
[name="Manticore Killer"]Mm...
[character(name="avg_npc_070", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Villager A"]Miss Manticore's awake! She brought back the news. We'd be done for without our leader...
[name="Villager A"]She's our hero!
[character(name="avg_npc_071", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Villager B"]I wouldn't go that far. She's just a hired killer. There are plenty more where she came from.
[character(name="avg_npc_072", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Villager C"]Who cares, we need to treat the wounded!
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]You found them...?
[name="Manticore Killer"]I drew the other mercenaries away... Lured them into quicksand...
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]......
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]Just from sheer exhaustion...
[name=""]The Manticore killer had brought back the news and eliminated the remaining enemies. By the looks of her injuries, she was telling the truth.
[name=""]It seems we misunderstood her.
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]Why aren't you saying anything... Did I fail my mission?
[name="Manticore Killer"]But I'm not so strong...
[name="Manticore Killer"]I'll leave if you feel I'm not a good enough killer...
[Decision(option1="(Explain)", value1="10.1")]
[predicate(references="10.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]No, it was just my mission...
[name="Manticore Killer"]You're my clients... And my job was to carry a message for the settlement...
[name="Manticore Killer"]It's so different from my old team... You even called me a hero...
[name="Manticore Killer"]Thank you...
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]No, we're the ones who should—
[name="Basil"]Ahem...
[name="Basil"]We've been thinking about the buildings you brought up before.
[name="Basil"]Having sentry posts and earthworks will let us detect threats early. The mercenaries and killers we hired aren't enough to protect us.
[Decision(option1="(Ask about remaining resources)", value1="11.1")]
[predicate(references="11.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]Not nearly enough for what she was asking for, but enough to bolster our defenses somewhat.
[name="Basil"]The Lord Ameer's already got his eyes on us for failing to pay his taxes on time. We need to be ready.
