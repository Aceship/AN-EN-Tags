[name="Manticore Killer"]...It must hurt, but only for a bit...
[name="Manticore Killer"]23, 24...
[name="Manticore Killer"]Almost there...
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]That's her.
[name="Basil"]Our gathering parties often run into this girl. She must be the 'hired killer' the black market merchants were talking about.
[name="Basil"]She does seem to have some skills. Here, she just does what she's paid to do and rarely interacts with anyone. She might be the kind of professional killer we're looking for.
[name="Basil"]Even if we want to work with 'Sand Soldier' to build a new faction, we can't always rely on him for resources.
[name="Basil"]Nngh... urgh!
[name="Basil"]Let... me... go!

[name="Manticore Killer"]Who are you...?

[name="Manticore Killer"]...What?
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]Whoa! Watch where you point that stinger!
[name="Basil"]We're from a nearby settlement!
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]Ah...
[name="Manticore Killer"]You're not my target... Sorry, I was on guard...
[name="Manticore Killer"]Then... why were you here?
[Decision(option1="(Tell her about why you are here)", value1="2.1")]
[predicate(references="2.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]You need a killer... and you're impressed by my skills? I'm like this sometimes... people don't notice me...
[name="Manticore Killer"]Is this some kind of test? See if I find you... and catch you like this...
[name="Manticore Killer"]My previous team said they're the only ones who'd accept a monster like me...
[name="Manticore Killer"]I have Oripathy...

[name="Basil"]It's not even the worst disease out there. Better to have each other's backs than to abandon friends and family over it.
[name="Basil"]We won't let something like that separate us from our loved ones. And we've never had a case of it spreading from one person to another.
[Decision(option1="What we need is capable people.", value1="6.1")]

[name="Basil"]If you're not under an exclusive contract, we'd like to hire you.
[name="Basil"]We might not be as... professional as your previous clients, though. We don't really have any important missions for you either, just to scout out the surroundings.
[name="Basil"]Still, would someone like you be willing to come to our settlement?
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]I see...
[name="Manticore Killer"]My previous team wouldn't stop me from finding a new employer... The leader thinks I'm dead... They don't care...
[name="Manticore Killer"]Can I... bring this prey I caught back? I can live three days off of it...
[Decision(option1="Is that what you eat?", value1="7.1")]
[predicate(references="7.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]Yes...
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]We have enough food. No need to worry about that.
[name="Basil"]All we expect is your loyalty.
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]Understood...
[name="Manticore Killer"]But there's something I'm concerned about...
[name="Manticore Killer"]Encounters with dangerous missions and people have taught me... We must always prepare, even if things seem calm for now...
[name="Manticore Killer"]Towers, turrets, base stations, weapons... We'll need them to keep us safe...
[Decision(option1="...Right now?", value1="8.1")]

[predicate(references="10.1")]
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]We couldn't build all that if we wanted to. Why even bring it up?
[character(name="avg_npc_802_1", offsetX="125", offsetY="100")]
[name="Manticore Killer"]Sorry, I talked too much...
[name="Manticore Killer"]Just tell me what you need me to do...
