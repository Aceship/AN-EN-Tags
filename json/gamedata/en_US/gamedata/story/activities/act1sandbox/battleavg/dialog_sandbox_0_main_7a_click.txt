[name="Old Isin"]Old Isin had a dream...
[name="Old Isin"]...The same dream.

[name=""]We came to the Reefsteep Black Market, per our promise with 'Sand Soldier.'
[name=""]But only Old Isin awaits. He is muttering something that's too hard to make out.
[name=""]He seems to have gotten even weirder these last few days, if that's possible.

[name="Old Isin"]A dream... Old Isin has had the same dream again and again for a hundred years...
[name="Old Isin"]Old Isin remembers the city in the sands... the showers of golden sand it brings when it moves, the blue sky... The pasha whispering by Old Isin's ear...
[name="Old Isin"]Old Isin remembers...
[name="Old Isin"]Bah, all that's left are gluttons and fools... How could they ever bring back our past glory?

[name="Old Isin"]Only the pasha, with true light in his heart, is worthy of this land...!
[name="Old Isin"]Find the palace... and we'll sit before his throne, listen to him describe the future...
[name="Old Isin"]Why do I wander here? How much time have I lost? How could I call myself his servant?
[name="Old Isin"]Old Isin must go... to that...
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]He limps away. Where is he going?
[name=""]The wind raises both the sands and a corner of the old soothsayer's hood. You see tears stream down his face.
[name=""]He walks towards the desert.
