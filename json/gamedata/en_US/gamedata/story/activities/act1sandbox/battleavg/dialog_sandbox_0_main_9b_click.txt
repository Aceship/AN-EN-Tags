[name="'Sand Soldier'"]They were just a few settlements and mercenary bands that harassed you. No need to personally come thank me.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]There may not be many of them, but it's in my interest that you're able to live in peace.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]I've heard rumors about the girl. A good assassin can always find employment. Her next target seems to be a Lord Ameer camp.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]It could be... dangerous.
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]The manticore killer never returned. We have long since lost track of her.
[name=""]Our cooperation with 'Sand Soldier' goes well. Things in the settlement are peaceful, and we continue to grow.
[name=""]We return to the settlement with intel from 'Sand Soldier' to make our plans.

[name="Basil"]...Head back! We need to head back!
[name="Basil"]The Lord Ameer's troops attacked our Headquarters!

[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]The Lord Ameer attacked our camp because we didn't pay him all our money, even though there's no law saying we have to!
[name="Basil"]But it's not just a warning this time! They want us gone! The settlement is... we tried to protect our homes and children, but...
[name="Basil"]How could they treat our lives so cheaply?
[name="Basil"]I'm going back first! Don't take too long!
