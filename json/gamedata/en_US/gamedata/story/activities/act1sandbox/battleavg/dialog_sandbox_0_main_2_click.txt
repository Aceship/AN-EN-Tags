[name="Old Isin"]Ah... guests, rare guests. Old Isin sees a new flame.
[name="Old Isin"]Were you also guided here by enticing words?
[character(name="avg_npc_165", offsetX="100", offsetY="50")]
[name="Basil"]...What a strange man. I can't tell if he's even talking to us.
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]Let's find some merchants. Maybe they'll have useful information.

[name="Black Market Merchant A"]Leithanian Arts Units, modified by Columbian merchants! You won't find anything better!
[name="Black Market Merchant A"]Check it out! Blacksteel's very own Originium weaponsâ€”
[character(name="avg_npc_008", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Black Market Merchant B"]...That's not nearly enough crude gold. Don't you try to swindle me with the homebrew stuff.
[character(name="char_empty_b", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name=""]This is the black market the liaison told us about.
[name=""]We should find 'Sand Soldier' and maybe take some commissions.
[name=""]Let's ask around.
[character(name="avg_npc_007", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Black Market Merchant A"](Hm, new faces in town.)
[character(name="avg_npc_008", offsetX="100", offsetY="100")]
[name="Black Market Merchant B"](Newcomers? Or somebody's informants? I should probe a little, see if they're working for 'Unicorn' or 'Black Scorpion.' Can't afford to lose any more men.)

[name="Black Market Merchant A"]Listen, newcomer, a fair trade means both sides can offer something of equal value. Not even a lord ameer can get something for nothing, and I can tell you've got nothing.
[name="Black Market Merchant A"]So get lost!

[name="Old Isin"]Perhaps next time, you'll find the grain of sand in the sandstorm, and 'Sand Soldier' will come to your aid.

[name="Basil"]We should ask him again next time we meet.
