[name="Treasure Hunter"]It's okay. Look at this old gold coin I just cleaned up. Pretty, ain't she?
[name="Treasure Hunter"]Ha, to think I'd meet a kindred spirit in a place like this!
[name="Treasure Hunter"]I'm something of an expert treasure hunter, here to collect all sorts of antique gold coins!

[name="Treasure Hunter"]But forget that. Is that... a treasure map?
[name="Treasure Hunter"]The old paper and faded text... Just imagine the sights it's seen... Huh, it's not in Sargonian...
[name="Treasure Hunter"]Let's see... 'treasure,' 'rocks,' 'buried'...

[name="Treasure Hunter"]You don't see maps like this every day. Someone drew it decades ago, maybe centuries. Picture it, one map, right here, linking us to our forefathers. To seek their treasure is also to uncover their history.
[name="Treasure Hunter"]Incredible, isn't it?
[name="Treasure Hunter"]......
[name="Treasure Hunter"]Hey, you're just nodding along blindly, aren't you?
