[name="Liaison"]Hey, stop daydreaming, guys!
[name="Liaison"]The Lord Ameer is angry that you've encroached on a stream in his territory! He's sending over troops!
[name="Liaison"]You're wondering how I know that?
[name="Liaison"]Well, last month, two lords ameer fought three days and nights over a territorial dispute. They finally came to an agreement that sorted it out down to the last fruit hanging on a tree by the border.
[name="Liaison"]And you haven't paid your taxes, have you? Of course they'll be coming for you.

[name="Liaison"]Is this really the time for that? The troops are already on their way! It might take a little while though...
[name="Liaison"]I ran over as soon as I heard, so stay sharp! Just a few days ago, another settlement was annexed for running too close to a wall.
[name="Liaison"]You need money and resources to get a firm footing here. Speaking of which, I have just the product for you right here! Ta-da!

[name="Liaison"]What a shame that our product can't meet your needs...
[name="Liaison"]But surely you were ready for something like this when you settled in Sargon? Use what time you have to build up your defenses!
[name="Liaison"]I heard that the Reefsteep Black Market sells base stations that can communicate across regions. With that, you could even contact mercenaries from outside and evacuate!
[name="Liaison"]Best of all, you could escape with the loot! You know, make the best of a bad situation.
