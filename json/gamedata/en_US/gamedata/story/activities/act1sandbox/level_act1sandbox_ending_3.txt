The Lord Ameer's golden goblet falls to the ground, its clanging drowned out by roars and screams.
When the fires finally die down, he lies motionless on the sands at the foot of his throne. In death, he is no different from any other man.
Who delivered the killing blow? Nobody saw, and nobody cares.
The only thing that matters is that he is dead.

People throw down their weapons and scramble for the scattered treasure, climbing over one another to reach it.
Soon, though, they pick up their weapons again, now directing them towards each other, their eyes clouded by bloodlust and the glint of gold.
On the ground is the symbol of power and authority.
The crown of the Lord Ameer.

One fire dies, another begins to burn.
In the chaos, no one even notices that the crown has fallen to the ground and rolled away.
Everyone in our clan is here. Most of us retreated outside the melee, supporting one another.
<i>We</i> notice the crown rolling away.

And 'Sand Soldier' walking away as well.
No one seems to care why he showed up all of a sudden, or why he is leaving.
We want to go up and ask why he went missing, why he showed up here, and why those unfamiliar clans and other groups showed up.
As well as why he pays no heed whatsoever to the crown, which came to rest by his feet.
But even more hands pull us away, back towards the crowd.

We returned to our settlement later.
We gained much from the victory: wealth, resources... but the divide in the clan remains.
We became entangled in the fight for the Lord Ameer's throne.

Perhaps it will belong to us, one day.
Until then, endless fighting awaits us, but we are confident that we can overcome it.
For our fallen friends and families, for the dream we've always shared.
......
The Manticore left us.
Apparently, she could not accept what we have become. The settlement is no longer a peaceful and happy place.
That was not the only tragedy.

She hands over a letter with trembling hands.
The rest of us are silent. No one reaches out to take it.
What the letter says no longer matters. We have taken revenge for our friends and families. The throne of the Lord Ameer will be ours, someday.
