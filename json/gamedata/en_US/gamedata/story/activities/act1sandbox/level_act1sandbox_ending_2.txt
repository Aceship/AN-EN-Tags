The heavy rock wall breaks away.
Ancient buildings hidden for countless years once again see the light of day, under the bright desert sun.
As the air rushes in, it stirs up a cloud of dust, and the frozen river of time begins to flow once again.
The Treasure Hunter raises her torch.
She gasps at the sight revealed before her.

The Treasure Hunter waves her torch, creating a glimmer like that of a golden Fin.
The others do the same, lighting up the space with their torches.
[playsound(key="$d_avg_coin",volume=0.6)]
Ding.
A golden coin tumbles down a golden hill.
It spins a few times as it falls, eventually settling by your feet.

Everyone looks up at the hill.
It feels as though the slightest touch would cause it to collapse, sending its contents everywhere.
[name="Surprised Villager"]Gold coins... are these all gold coins?
[name="Surprised Villager"]Hey, pinch me, I think I'm dreaming...
[name="Excited Villager"]No, you're not! It's real!
[name="Excited Villager"]Treasure! We hit the motherlode!
[name="Loud Villager"]Treasure! Gold! We're rich!

[name="Treasure Hunter"]...Wait, I do?!
[name="Treasure Hunter"]But if the Lord Ameer finds out...
[name="Joyful Villager"]We'll just have to keep it a secret!
[name="Joyful Villager"]Heck, we could move wherever we want with this much gold!
[name="Surprised Villager"]I heard that there are places out there where people get to eat and sleep with a roof over their heads without having to work. I wonder if it's true.
[name="Loud Villager"]What? No need to gather vegetables, no need to hunt, no need to farm or cut trees... nothing?
[name="Loud Villager"]That... that...

[name="Loud Villager"]That sounds amazing!
[name="Surprised Villager"]Yeah! I've never left Sargon in my life!
[name="Cautious Villager"]Hey, that doesn't sound so bad.
[name="Joyful Villager"]We'll buy the best equipment from the liaison!
[name="Loud Villager"]I want to travel the world!

Sounds of joy echo through the ancient ruins.
The villagers believe.
They've built their homestead from nothing, tilling the soil with their own two hands.
So this treasure must be a gift from the heavens.
The gold glitters before them.
It will buy them the happiness and prosperity that they have longed for.
Here and now, no one even slightly doubts this indisputable truth.
