[name="Ceylon"]Before Siesta moved, this obsidian was an extremely precious ore. However, only obsidian that was pure enough or which reflected the colors of the rainbow could fetch a good price. I'm sure you're aware.

[name="Gentle Scholar"]Tom cares, Hank cares, Bill cares, many workers will care.
[name="Gentle Scholar"]I also want to push a new policy regarding the current state of these workers. These workers who've contracted Oripathy due to Obsidian mining should be taken better care of.
