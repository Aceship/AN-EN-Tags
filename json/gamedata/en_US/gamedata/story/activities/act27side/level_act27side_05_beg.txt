Why study volcanoes?
Because, I hope to play a guitar at the highest spot on Siesta one day. It doesn't have to be at the Obsidian Festival, and preferably at the top of a volcano.
'Volcano Sonatas', that's what I'm planning to call my first album.
I can't wake the volcano up? Ahaha... maybe I should call it 'Volcano Lullabies' instead.
Volcanoes sleep like a log, so I don't think you'll be able to wake it up that easily.

Have you heard of this, about a kind of stone you can find on a volcano?
When the wind blows it away, it makes a sound like beans falling into a bowl.
And if you soak it in water, bubbles fizz like a complex drumline.
Of course it's real. If I find such a stone on a volcano, I'll bring one back to show it to you.
