[name="Magna"]Adele, you asked us before why we love volcanoes, right?
[name="Magna"]I promise you this. Once you see a volcano erupt with your own eyes, you'll never forget the feeling.
[name="Magna"]I like to sit on the slopes and meditate. The land and us are both full of mystery, and even if we spend our lifetimes seeking answers, we may not be able to solve even a tiny fraction of them. Still, I do enjoy the puzzle solving.
[name="Katia"]Mankind may have invented nomadic cities, but we still haven't completely figured out how Catastrophes form. We may have invented many tools with Originium, but we also have no way to counter their effects when they backfire.
[name="Katia"]Humans need to admit just how insignificant they are when they come face to face with nature's mighty forces. That way, they won't spend so much energy meaninglessly slaughtering each other.
[name="Magna"]Adele, don't mind Katia's pessimism. Not everywhere is as simple as Siesta.
[name="Magna"]It's natural for him to grumble when, as a scholar, he's all wrapped up in noble bickering, but on these issues, I've always looked at things quite differently from him.
[name="Magna"]Naturally, humans are insignificant, but it's exactly because we are so insignificant that we can live on the land.

Streams colored dark red can be seen slowly climbing their way through the mountain rocks like the blood veins in one's body, all while the enormous thing breathes strenuously.
From the earth's core to this cliff, they flowed through the ages, enduring an intense heat and utter silence.
This path seems to not be nearly as long as Adele had imagined. With the strength she has, she can still climb onto this mountain.
But this path also seems to be much longer than she had imagined. It's long enough for her memories to be rinsed countless of times at the bottom of her heart.
