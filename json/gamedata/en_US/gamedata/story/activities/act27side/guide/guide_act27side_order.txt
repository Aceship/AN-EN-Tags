[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] D-Doctor! You're finally here... You're asking why I opened the shop? It's because of Swire, of course...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] She got some government funding for an on-site investigation to calculate the Fashion Street's commercial value, and then asked me to run the shop...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] I have a little knowledge about running a business, but I was hoping to have some guidance too...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] I'm sure there's a lot of differences between running a store in theory and in practice, right? For example—Purchasing goods!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Siestan Fashion Street may be in a bit of a slump right now, but we still have to prepare for potential customers.
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_customer", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Customers can be divided into three groups, based on what they're a fan of: food, drinks, or gifts.
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_customer", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] The more money we make, the more we can help the businesses prosper, and more tourists will visit the Fashion Street to shop!
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_good", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Before we open for the day, we'll first have to acquire our three products, the quantity depending on the amount of customers visiting that day.
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_good", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] However... the daily supply of every product is limited, and three other rival shops will be competing with us to buy their own stock.
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_price", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] There are three different purchasing strategies you can employ when buying goods, depending on their unit price... Oh, I remember now. They're risky, safe, and balanced!
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_price", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Buying goods in a greater quantity will require you to offer a more attractive, higher unit price.
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_price", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Oh no! Our rival set the same buying price as us... should we increase ours?
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_price", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Oh, but we can't be too aggressive either... each customer will only make one purchase, and it'll be bad for us if we can't sell them all!
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_inquire", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Hm? You're asking how we can know our rivals' strategy beforehand? According to Swire, information is the key to gaining the upper hand in the business world!
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_inquire", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] We can have Mr. Enis 'Ask Around', and find out their purchasing strategies in advance.
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_inquire", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Once we gather some intelligence, we can decide how aggressive our shop should be and determine the amount of goods to purchase!
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_inquire_detail", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Bear in mind that we can only 'Ask Around' four times a day, and this limit is shared between our buying and selling phases. We'll also need to ‘Ask Around' when we're selling our goods, so be careful!
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_inquire_detail", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] The number of times you can 'Ask Around' refreshes every day, but unused attempts won't carry over to the next day either, so make sure to use every opportunity you've got!
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_inquire_detail", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] You can 'Ask Around' a few more times on your first attempt while you're getting used to it, but it'll be limited to four times a day afterwards.
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_inquire_detail", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Of course, you can also gradually increase the number of times you can 'Ask Around' by collecting more coupons.
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_inquire_detail", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] Any leftover unsold food or drinks will be destroyed when we close for the day.
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_inquire_detail", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] However, any unsold gifts are carried over to be sold on the next day! Hehe... We can even give any leftovers to our friends at Rhodes Island when this is all over!
[Tutorial(target="grocery_order_inquire_detail", focusStyle="HighlightRect",           black="$f_tut_black", animStyle="Highlight", protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_npc_1005")] New drinks and food will be available as time goes by. Don't miss out on these new products, Doctor, so we can provide our customers with unique experiences.
