Oof... This is just the right temperature. Hot springs are fun, but the temperature's a tad bit too peaceful.
<i>This</i> temperature keeps my head clear. Helps me think about the real important questions.
Say... Which did the planet birth first? Lava or rocks?
Let's start from the very beginning. 'Lava' wasn't 'lava,' and 'rock' wasn't 'rock.' All thing are a cycle, and they take different shapes during their changes, and so they were given different names.
Man is always trying to use assertive language to delimit the indescribable natures of the world, almost like it's the only way they can get a good night's sleep. This, too, goes to show their lack of wisdom...
Hey, watch out there. Don't splash all that lava everywhere. It's dangerous. It's not <i>that</i> likely, but what if someone just happens to walk by—
Hm? What's with the ruckus... Is somebody trying to join us?
