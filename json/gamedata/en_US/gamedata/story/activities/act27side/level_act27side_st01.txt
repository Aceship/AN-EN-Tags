Whoops, got it wrong again. Alright, this time from the top.
One, two, three...
Five thousand seven hundred sixty-one, five thousand seven hundred sixty-two... Also, didn't a few end up in Leithanien?
Well, whatever. Let them have their fun. It's about time those tall, ancient, goatee-shaped buildings got shaken up a bit, along with those people whose expressions are as crusty as their music.
Time is precious, or at least it is for them. If they can't concoct something new and exciting within the very limited time they have, then I'm going to be stuck here enduring years of stagnation and emptiness, dammit.
Times like these make me miss the days when I was getting chased around by those long-haired, sharp-fanged folk. But now, they seem to have invented a new game to play in Siracusa. They don't feel like playing with me anymore.
*sigh*... I should also find something fun to do.
The world is always full of twists and turns, and to exist means to change. Yet why do so many people find themselves in trouble because of these all-too-commonplace occurrences?
Just like building a house. It'll always go higher today than it was yesterday. Yet despite that, there are always people who want to go backwards and tear down the old parts. Seriously... spare me already.
If only these fragile and brief lives could last a bit longer, they would have the same wealth of wisdom as I. They would understand existence, or at least the purpose of existing.
I suppose only a few might be able to comprehend this truth, just like that song. How did it go again? The tune went something like laa laa laa... Hrmm...
Damn, forgot again.
