One, two, three... a little creature stops and lifts its head in the light of the streetlamps.
Furry creatures leap and roll on the unfinished plate in the pale moonlight.
Four, five, six...
Little bits of wool drift in the air, under the scattered lamp light.
Almost like sparks, falling in this summer night that no one knows about.
Seven, eight, nine...
They leap across the container in orderly file, leaving marks on the metal with their hooves...

[name="Dolly"]As for your parents, of course I knew them.
[name="Dolly"]I remember that young couple from Leithanien, who wanted to conquer all the volcanoes across the globe.
[name="Dolly"]I have to say that, for humans, trying to achieve something regarding 'everything' in the world is a fool's errand.

[name="Dolly"]Thank goodness you aren't asking me why I didn't save them.
[name="Dolly"]I love volcanoes, of course. Surfing on molten lava is the second best thing on the planet.
[name="Dolly"]But volcanoes took the lives of two of my friends. It's the eleventh worst thing to happen in recent years.
[name="Dolly"]We all want to prevent bad things from happening, but I'm not as omnipotent as I look. There are many things I can't do.
[name="Dolly"]If you're really sad, though, you can rub yourself against my wool. That often helps when you're feeling down.
