[name="Gentle Creature"]Our little stone will return. Someday, when that happens, we'll be able to see it again.

[name="Gentle Creature"]We're going to fly down together.

Adele hugs the creature by her side, and tries making a stepâ€”
She falls downwards, but it is slow and light, as if she is floating.

She sees her hair flying around her, the other Little Black Sheep lightly jumping around the lights of the shops.
The wool on her body holds her up, enveloping her. An experience already in the depths of her childhood memories, her parents hold her up, and throw her into the sky to catch the stars above.
She falls onto the wool, fluffy and soft beneath her. The stars fall into her eyes, and her eyes grow hot.
Shadows come and go on the street, and Adele tries to get on her feet, wanting to share this fantastic feeling with the two fluffy creatures by her side.

[name="Adele"]The Little Black Sheep from earlier mentioned a flower shop just ahead. My mother used to always place some flowers by my bed when I was young. Do you like flowers?
[name="Adele"]Those small and white flowers, that look like you two.
[name="Adele"]Look, just like the one on that Little Black Sheep.

The remainder of Adele's words choke in her throat. She realizes the fluffy critters have stopped following her, the flowers and leaves from her staff fluttering around the two.
They take a few steps back, their figures melting into the night.
