[name="Keller"]Mm. And if they came, you'd plug your guitar in, and off you went with your heavy metal racket.
[name="Keller"]Magna always felt 'that boy at the cafe' never seemed to welcome them too much.
[name="Costa"]Aah... I was just a little too willful of a brat, back then.
[name="Costa"]It wasn't meant at them specifically...
[name="Keller"]I know. And they didn't take it to heart.
[name="Keller"]You gave them coffee soda to try once, and make us swear to secrecy that we wouldn't tell Grandpa Mockingbird.
[name="Costa"]He couldn't stand the drinks I came up with. Every time I added them to the menu, he'd wipe them off... They were just as bizarre to him as my axe, and my drumkit.
[name="Costa"]By the way, that wasn't just your average coffee soda. It was called 'volcanic coffee.'
[name="Keller"]Alright, alright, yes, 'volcanic coffee.'
[name="Keller"]It <i>was</i> a nice drink, in any case. After we went to Leithanien, Katia would follow your recipe to recreate the flavor for himself.
[name="Costa"]How are... Katia, and... Magna doing?
[name="Costa"]I remember when you left Siesta, you said, you'd be visiting every volcano across the land with them.
[name="Keller"]......
[name="Keller"]I spent a long, long time with them on our travels.
[name="Keller"]But a few years ago, we strayed apart.
[name="Costa"]Strayed?
[name="Keller"]Yes.
[name="Keller"]And we're never to meet again.
[name="Costa"]......
[name="Costa"]Was it...? I'm so sorry...
[name="Keller"]Hence why I came back. Opened that museum. Hoped I could preserve all the research they'd done.
[name="Costa"]When I—saw you at the museum that day, it completely... totally blindsided me.
[name="Keller"]It was a great surprise to me too. You're nothing like the noisy little child I remember.
[name="Costa"]You, too... You're a museum curator and everything.
[name="Keller"]Mm. I suppose I've turned an old ideal or two into reality. No matter what, though, the conviction that keeps me going now isn't... really what drove me in the first place anymore.

[name="Costa"]Did you go to the trade fair today?
[name="Keller"]The trade fair? I did. Tourists were profuse, proprietors were in high spirits—much like the Siesta of old.
[name="Costa"]Maybe once this place is all rebuilt, and the tourist influx comes, I'll have an idea or two about what's next for me.
[name="Keller"]For example?
[name="Costa"]Who knows...? I'll probably keep running a cafe, but maybe a rock 'n' roll cafe, or just a music shop, filled to the walls with drum kits and guitars. Lots to try. Always someone out there who'll enjoy it.
[name="Costa"]Just like you say... just like the Siesta of old.
[name="Costa"]Oh, something very funny that happened today too. I was at the trade fair, and I saw this soft drink from Columbia. The recipe was one-for-one with my 'volcanic coffee.' The exact same.
[name="Keller"]Well, I didn't leak your secret recipe!
[name="Costa"]No, no, it was a year ago when I was planning to shutter the shop. I told somebody else about how to make it.
[name="Costa"]But honestly... it's just coffee plus soda water. Of course some Columbian could've come up with it on their own too.
[name="Keller"]Hand-brewed coffee and soda water. How did you come up with it at first?
[name="Costa"]When I was young, I thought coffee was so bitter, I was <i>convinced</i> I had to add something to even make it drinkable!
[name="Keller"]You shook the whole cafe playing your rock 'n' roll, and yet you were bad with bitter.
[name="Costa"]Who'd care about something like <i>that,</i> back then?
Keller laughs, downing the last gulp of coffee in her cup. The aroma lingers lazily in the cafe air.
