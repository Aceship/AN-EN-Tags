[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_bryota")] Steam Soda Bottles can be deployed anywhere on the map. We can use them to fill the area with Pure White Steam.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_bryota")] We have a lot of bottles in stock, as many as you need. The redeployment time of Steam Soda Bottles will also be reduced when more Pure White Steam is present on the field!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amgoat")] There are more of these troublesome creatures headed our way, Professor. Let's stop them together!
