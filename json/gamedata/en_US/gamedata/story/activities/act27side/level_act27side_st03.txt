Some ecologists have categorized all the fowlbeasts on this great land into two categoriesâ€”'Wayfowls' and 'Homefowls'.
The former will, owing to climatic and ecological shifts, constantly relocate as they look for the most suitable habitat for survival; while the latter once settled in their habitat, will stay for good, and stop at nothing to protect their homes.
This biological theory was later borrowed by historians to suggest that 'all conflict between the races on this continent stems from the differing views between those who can only live in one place and those who drift nomadically.'
Afterwards came yet another supplementary addition to this viewpoint.
There were originally no Homefowls on this great land, but as the fowlbeasts gradually gathered in places, built their homes together, and created a collective memory, the Homefowls came to be.
