Hello, Mr. Adams Schwire. As always, I first wish you good health.
By the time this disc reaches you, I should have completed both my Siesta trip, and all the business objectives I sought to accomplish.
Perhaps you may still take this as a child's folly—no, your insight must have recognized the value of this city, the value of a free and independent entrepot.
I've known from my first day here in Siesta that I've been tailed by some of our people watching my every move, perhaps at your behest, or perhaps at that of your other heirs trying to obstruct me.
But that no longer matters. I've long since realized that trying to read your mind is a laborious and pointless endeavor.
But if you <i>are</i> the one standing opposite me, then I've won this time.

[name="Swire"]I thought and thought before I finally came to a conclusion: you've allowed yourself to become a symbol.
[name="Swire"]No one knows your true intentions, nor do they know whom amongst them has your confidence. This fear of the unknown leaves them with only one option: to acquiesce to you.
[name="Swire"]This is how you've manipulated the Federation of Enterprises and even Lungmen's economic lifelines for so many decades. I may not ever manage to learn this trick of yours, but... Such a style of control always meets an end.
[name="Swire"]How will the Federation of Enterprises cope without their leader when you're gone? How many of them will take advantage of the chaos to recklessly reap personal profit? I think that's something you wouldn't want to happen either.
[name="Swire"]Perhaps you still have faith in your personal physician, but as the soon-to-be Commissioner of the Lungmen Guard Department, and also as part of the younger generation, I must make plans for a Lungmen future without you.

[name="Harley"]My head was full of places I wanted to run off to, I wanted to get to know all kinds of people, play all kinds of rock music, learn local languages and figure out how to fit them into a song.
[name="Harley"]You know yourself, it was those days that I met Chuck in Siesta.
[name="Harley"]We wanted to see the beautiful 'White Volcano' people kept talking about, but we spent months wandering the beach and volcanoes with no luck.
[name="Harley"]And just as we were about to leave Siesta to continue chasing the legend, we found in a corner of the Fashion Street, a baby sleeping soundly.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_994_1#5$1",focus="l")]

[name="Harley"]But on that day of the trade fair, all the surfboards from the shop disappeared, and the three of you looked so flustered, drenched in hot spring water, but you looked so, so happy. Tell you the truth, I was happy too.
