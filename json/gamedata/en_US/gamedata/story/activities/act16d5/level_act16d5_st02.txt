[name="Dawn"]Today, the story I'll tell will be much simpler than any of those mythical tales you've collected.
[name="Dawn"]They say that ten years ago, on the southeast border of Yen, there was a small town named P'o-shan...
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#2",name2="avg_npc_139#5",focus=1)]
[name="Storyteller"]You...

[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4",name2="avg_npc_139#5",focus=2)]
[name="Dawn"]Mm. Okay.
[Character(name="avg_npc_139#5")]
[name="Dawn"]P'o-shan was normal as could be. It had no more than a hundred households, and they lived off the mountain, passing simple days. Sometimes a merchant caravan would pass through, and on those days, the children went wild with joy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_139#2")]
[name="Dawn"]And this small town, one day, suffered a Catastrophe.
[Character(name="avg_npc_139")]
[name="Dawn"]The Catastrophe didn't completely destroy the town, but active Originium polluted its springs. The adults thought to seek aid from a nearby city, but there were no town Messengers, and all the adults who left went completely dark.
[name="Dawn"]So, helpless, the people abandoned this town, and began to aimlessly journey—
[name="Dawn"]Nobody from the town actually knew where to go, and they didn't even have an idea of where the nearest city was. It was just as if they entrusted themselves to fate, and chose a direction.
[name="Dawn"]To the children, the warm beds, the winding fences, the amusing water stains along the walls, had all suddenly turned into pitch-black nights, and one... very long road.
[name="Dawn"]And on this road, many starved to death.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4")]
[name="Storyteller"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_139#5")]
[name="Dawn"]There was a child, not very old, whose family was so poor.
[name="Dawn"]She went with her mother and father, watching as all her close neighbors had less and less to say.
[name="Dawn"]Watching as all the older kids who played with her fought each other, fought with sharp stones, over a moldy piece of shaobing bread.
[name="Dawn"]She thought, maybe things would get better. And she tried hard, to find berries, find small animals, catch the scalecis in the river.
[name="Dawn"]She almost drowned in there trying to catch them, and several times passed out from hunger.
[name="Dawn"]Maybe fortune felt cruel one day. Maybe the ones closest to her came to a sudden realization, that this thin little girl's final use would be to save them some rations.
[name="Dawn"]And when she returned 'home' clutching mountain fruits she didn't know if anyone could eat, there was not a single person left.
[name="Dawn"]The cry of the beasts on the cold night cliff reminded her: her life was worth nothing. In her confused daze, it was as if heaven and her were of the same sympathy, every inch of her skin telling her the temperature of death. And then—
[name="Dawn"]She met someone. A... very strange someone.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4")]
[name="Storyteller"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4",name2="avg_npc_139#4",focus=2)]

[name="Storyteller"]......
