[name="Storyteller"]—The finishing touch is the hardest part. Lady Hsü racked her brains, for all along she had been lacking that final touch.
[name="Storyteller"]Lady Hsü dared not be reckless, but ultimately could not find the idea she most took to. Her mind in turmoil, she could only take to the streets to relieve her boredom. There, she so happened to hear a butcher calling out, and in the cage by the butcher's side, there was shut a plump fowlbeast.
[name="Storyteller"]For a long time, Lady Hsü stared at that fowl. Perhaps it knew its death was soon to come, and stupefied, the animal watched the pedestrians pass to and fro, making surprisingly little commotion.
[name="Storyteller"]Watching and watching, Lady Hsü couldn't help but begin to imagine herself as that fowlbeast, and deep inside, what it might be thinking.
[name="Storyteller"]All who came and went were other sorts, incomprehensible, and far from the grass and riverbanks, in this wilderness of a culture not its own, it was one and alone.
[name="Storyteller"]Fate was long since a foregone discussion, and it could now only seek a monumental release.
[name="Storyteller"]On nothing more than helplessness and apathy, such indescribable feelings—Lady Hsü found herself taking a few steps closer, and the fowlbeast, as if drawn in by that gaze of wild imagination, turned to Lady Hsü.
[name="Storyteller"]In that cosmic instant, there was no need for fierce method, sparse colors, and no need to worry how the noble purchasing a painting felt.
[name="Storyteller"]Success and failure, gain and loss. In the eyes of this livestock awaiting slaughter, Lady Hsü found an answer to all of them.
[name="Storyteller"]She paid the money to buy the fowl, kept it in the pond in her garden, and immediately took up her brush to add the finishing touches, the movements coming like a flow, no longer hindered at all.
[name="Storyteller"]On the second day, Lady Hsü finished with ease the court-lady painting, and received high praise from the officials and nobles.
[name="Storyteller"]Carrying great strings of gold and silver on the way home, Lady Hsü had all along felt that beyond the finishing touches, some little bit else was missing, and was frustrated as though she had failed.
[name="Storyteller"]Only when she opened her gate, and saw that fowl treading water in her pond, did she come to a sudden realization.
[name="Storyteller"]She'd thought she had achieved success, and had long escaped the chopping board, scarcely imagining that she had only changed the pond she was in, and lacked for freedom once again.
[name="Storyteller"]The present Lady Hsü had long advanced past the full-spirited, youthful girl she once was.
[name="Storyteller"]Over the decades she had taken up her brush, with fame and fortune both, yet her husband had passed in his prime; now she had to gaze over the looks of others. Who would still come to give her finishing touches, to let her free back into her fields?
[name="Storyteller"]What returned to the Hsü manor that evening was but carriages of gold and silver riches.
[name="Storyteller"]It is said that afterwards, some sighted Lady Hsü at the border of Jiangqi, but regardless, ever since then, the lady painter acclaimed as 'the place where magnificence dwells' was never seen again.
[name="Storyteller"]Twenty whole years later, among the powers of Hsi, the City of Dusk, there circulated a painting reputed to be Lady Hsü's final work—her swansong.
[name="Storyteller"]Most people thought it a fake. It was incomparable with the works of Lady Hsü in her younger years, and its content was incomprehensible. A great deal of the painting was left blank, depicting only a fowlbeast, its appearance as though dead.
[name="Storyteller"]Many evaluators believed that among similar paintings of beasts, quite a few great painters drew the beasts of flight and field, vivid and lifelike, remarkably animate, as though they could emerge from the scroll at any time.
[name="Storyteller"]But this fowlbeast was abnormally stiff, lacking all life, and therefore it was regarded as a fake.
[name="Storyteller"]Among Lady Hsü's admirers, there was one named Kuei-yü. He was wise with business when young, and had presently come on hard times, scattering his wealth away, hanging in the balance—his most frustrated moments.
[name="Storyteller"]Kuei-yü saw this scroll, saw the fowlbeast's eyes, and it was if lightning had struck him. He returned home half-dreaming, unable to settle for the longest time, and after more than ten days without proper sleep or food, he made up his mind, and gathered himself once again.

[name="Storyteller"]The world's affairs are inconstant.
[name="Storyteller"]Perhaps only those in frustration's throes like Kuei-yü could see clearly the implications Lady Hsü had hidden in the eyes of that fowlbeast pale as ashes, the longing without end, and the meaning of that 'beastly prisoner within the painting.'
[name="Storyteller"]Life. Life is no more than this.

[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1",name2="avg_npc_138#4",focus=2)]
[name="Storyteller"]Indeed. The library in my study is quite abundant, and doesn't lack in handwritten folklore nor tales of the strange, but there's no doubt that a majority of it relates to the outstanding painters in history.
[name="Storyteller"]Of course, there are also records of minor characters which, for all sorts of reasons, have been buried in anonymity within the history of Yen.
[name="Storyteller"]Though ultimately they were never able to stand out in prominence, they still have graceful glimpses of this world of ours, their writers unknown, neither if they're true or false.
[name="Storyteller"]Come to mention it... Miss Lava, your friend's person you're searching for is a painter as well, isn't she?
[name="Storyteller"]If she's a recognized name, perhaps with some small fame somewhere, then I may or may not be able to find some clues.
