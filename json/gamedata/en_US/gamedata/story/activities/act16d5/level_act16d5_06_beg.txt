[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]As I said before, I have spent many a moon inside this scroll. It can hardly be called an astute observation.
[name="Saga"]For those not originally from the scroll, suppose we all have an eye each. With four of us, and that makes four eyes.
[name="Saga"]As we fall asleep, we close our eyes. With that, there is no longer anyone gazing upon its scenery... and slowly it returns to the way it was. By the time we open our eyes and lay them upon it yet again, everything has gone back to its original shape and form.
[name="Saga"]'Tis what happens every time we awaken here. I have long grown accustomed to this anomaly.
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#4")]
[name="Lava"]So... we're really inside a... painting?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]

[name="Kroos"]Saga, is this going to affect our thought process... the way we think?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Hm, now I wonder? Naught has ever seemed particularly strange to me...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_139#5")]
[name="Dawn"]That's just how you've always been.
[name="Dawn"]Thanks to your monastery's head priest, you're no less familiar with world affairs despite your isolation from the outside world. On the contrary. Since you left Higashi, each step you've taken helped broaden your horizons, and though you may be directionless, you have never let that dampen your spirits.
[name="Dawn"]When life gives you lemons, if you then proceed to make lemonade, you would of course think nothing of them.
[name="Dawn"]To most people, this is nothing but a dream. The longer you're here, the easier it is to forget the things that should have been natural. The longer you're here, the more you come to accept the place as natural.
[name="Dawn"]In the end, you come to know the painting, and the painting comes to know you. You have become one with the painting, never to leave again.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Oh! So this is what you meant when you had me look for Lava! My, my. How dimwitted of me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#3")]
[name="Kroos"]Hey, Lava? I noticed it yesterday, but... there's no Originium here.
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#4")]
[name="Kroos"]I can't imagine building a village of this size without any Originium at all. Not even villages without any kind of mobility, in the most remote parts of Yen where Catastrophes rarely happen, can get by without any.

[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#3")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]My apologies, but I'm afraid... you've lost me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_139#5")]
[name="Dawn"]Out of the goodness of your hearts, you gave this village the helping hand it needed in its time of need, but... it was all futile and pointless.
[name="Dawn"]Sorry for not being more forthcoming before. At the time, we still had a guest in P'o-shan. It looks like she is already gone, though.

[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
