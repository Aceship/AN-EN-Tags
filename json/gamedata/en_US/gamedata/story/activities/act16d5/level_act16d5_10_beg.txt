[name="Nian"]A long time ago, there existed many gods in the lands of Yen.
[name="Nian"]The Yen emperor at the time saw his territory prosper, but his people suffered disasters and misfortunes one after another. He lamented this vicious cycle, and spent a long time to come up with a solution.
[name="Nian"]He was the True Lung. Likely one of the most controversial men in Yen history, he was at the time still young in years, and his passion was unrivaled. As the emperor of Yen, he turned to his trusted retinue and told them this—
[name="Nian"]All the lands under heaven belong to the throne, and all men are my servants. Why then do the divinities above listen not to the will of the people of Great Yen and deprive our lands of their protection?
[name="Nian"]...As you probably know, when the 'gods' are brought up in certain countries' folklore or history, they aren't necessarily merely philosophical concepts. That said, they aren't exactly all that mighty and revered either.
[name="Nian"]Case in point, the Lung found one such god deep in the mountains. A prideful and disdainful god.
[name="Nian"]Yen's long history was a brief stretch of time to him... Naturally, he didn't give any thought to the Lung's opinions, and he had no reason to care about the lives of mere mortals.
[name="Nian"]Now, this is where the problem lies. The Lung was too concerned with his subjects and his country.
[name="Nian"]He issued and personally led his entire military, joined by many a formidable fighter, to take to the mountains on this wild hunt—
[name="Nian"]And... beyond anyone's expectations, being that the Lung first uncovered there decided to betray his kin and his fellow deities. It divided up its own strength, and participated in this once-in-a-lifetime wild hunt.
[name="Nian"]After this great wild hunt, Yen slayed several of these 'gods' who dared to stand up against the Lung, and all those unwilling to submit to his rule were exiled.
[name="Nian"]Much blood was shed, and many lives were lost. Yen paid a dear price, and that's how this controversy surrounding the True Lung came to be.
[name="Nian"]But he personally didn't care about this, and his campaign continued for as long as the Lung lived.
[name="Nian"]When he was finally old and frail, he found the last such being remaining in Yen's lands. The most ancient and the most sacred. The eternal being that chose to betray its kin for the Lung's cause.
[name="Nian"]The traitor had already received the justice it deserved. When its kin left the lands of Yen, they also took care to put out its flames of arrogance. Thus, its true nature was laid bare to the emperor—
[name="Nian"]Anyway, its contributions had more than earned it the Lung's mercy. Nonetheless, the Lung forced it to serve Yen. To serve heaven, the lands, and its people to keep the world at peace.
[name="Nian"]Ever since, the fortunes of Yen have always belonged to the True Lung and his subjects.
[name="Nian"]And at the same time, the so-called 'gods'—Though they had existed long before all the nations in the world came to be, they chose to hide themselves. They spread their own seeds across the land, placed the broken shards of their power and souls, and let them take root in this world in their place.

[name="Nian"]Your art?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1#4")]
[name="Nian"]Oh, I see. The moment we flung that door open, we'd already stepped into the world of your paintings, huh?
[name="Nian"]Or are we in the middle of a hike? Maybe this whole mountain is just a fantasy that you've dreamt up?
[name="Nian"]Oh, no wonder I could never find you, you unsociable loner—
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#5")]
[name="Lava"]W-What?
[Character(name="char_2014_nian_1")]
[name="Nian"]That's right. I mean, you can't possibly hide all that junk in a cottage that small, can you? Are you telling me none of you figured that out?
[name="Nian"]Hm, I guess most people's cognition and senses get affected, though. Can't blame you for not noticing, then.
[name="Nian"]It's just like how you wouldn't feel anything's off no matter what kind of weird dream you have in your sleep.
