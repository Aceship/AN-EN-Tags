[name="Lava"]—The sky... the color?
[name="Kroos"]Did we never look at the sky before...? We should've noticed any moment we lifted our heads... now that's odd.
[name="Mr.Nothing"]B... benefactors, what's going on? Look over there, is that... is that a moon, now?!
[name="Mr.Nothing"]And it's broad daylight right now, isn't it? Why have they lit lanterns on the other end of the bridge?
[name="Lava"]Look behind you...
[name="Mr.Nothing"]Er?
[name="Lava"]The horizon on the other side. Is that... is that the sun?
[name="Kroos"]Hey. You think us coming back from there to here counted as 'going' one full day and night?
[name="Lava"]This is really... new to me. Nian always told me that Yen was full of weird, unseen wonders... and landscapes like this too?
[name="Lava"]Uh, hold on, I think there's something in my pocket...
[name="Lava"]Is this—the charm Nian gave me...?
