[name="Saga"]That is so.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]What exactly do you mean?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=1)]
[name="Saga"]Ah, I understand now. Your party is akin to me, having erred and fallen into these mountains and rivers—
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]Huh?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=1)]
[name="Saga"]At the outset, I was only passing through the Kou-wu boundary in Yen. Suddenly, I had the thought that I wanted to visit the posterity of the great artist.
[name="Saga"]The sight under the waterfalls of Mount Hui-ch'i is beautiful beyond comprehension, and I slept one night in a thatched cottage in the mountains. I had never thought that next I opened my eyes, I would be here.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]Hold on, wait. Wait. What do you mean? You were looking for 'Dusk' too?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=1)]
[name="Saga"]Dusk? I have never heard tell of this name before...
[name="Saga"]The one I sought was the Yen painter for whom 'one stroke crude mounts rose, whence the words, winds, flow.'
[name="Saga"]But working out the days, I feared that painter had already left our world of mortals, and thus thought to call upon their former residence. That is all.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]In any case, first you went to Mount Hui-ch'i in Kou-wu in Yen, and then you inexplicably ended up here, right?!
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=1)]
[name="Saga"]Ho, that is not false, but why does it agitate thee so?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]And then you said this place is a painting scroll—
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=1)]
[name="Saga"]Nothing of this world conforms to reason. Lava, didst thou never realize?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]No, I know that. But why a painting...?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=1)]
[name="Saga"]It is difficult to explain, but I have traveled this P'o-shan Village across... about a hundred or more scrolls now! At least, I am well aware of where I myself am.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]Guh... those people are real, living people, the tea has flavor, the fruit is edible...
[name="Lava"]Is this all just some sort of Arts? But if it was... then what kind of...
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=1)]
[name="Saga"]It is completely beyond my reckoning. Had I not the fortune to glimpse the truth of this world, I fear that I too would be unable to realize where I am.
[name="Saga"]No Catastrophe disturbs here, and all living beings follow their own customs, creating their own enclosure, too wondrous for words. Staying here, I have never wanted for ease.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]That's...
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=1)]
[name="Saga"]Hah-hah, the look on thine face is all too unavoidable. When I first met that dusken Hsi-o, she took the same look as thee...
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"]Slow down... who did you say you met?!
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#6", name2="char_1011_purgatory_1",focus=1)]
[name="Saga"]I met a—wait now. Those lights, could they be the merchant's shop? So she never took refuge! We must act!
