[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]I have seen the plums blossom and wither ten times.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]As long as my ink brush remain untouched, the scenery in the painting would never change.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#4")]
[name="Saga"]To tell the truth, I had been counting ever since the moment I entered the painting scroll of Mount Sky. 'Twas indeed that long.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]...Ten years?
[name="Storyteller"]You stayed in the painting for ten years?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]More or less.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]You, a mere wandering monk, fiddled away ten full years here. What drove you to partake in such meaningless tribulations?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#3")]
[name="Saga"]Well, I could enjoy a good sleep, partake in all manner of indulgences, and I need not be disturbed by the world, to say nothing of the Catastrophes and infections. I thought it a rather pleasant experience.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]Be that as it may, you dreamt... for ten full years.
[name="Storyteller"]Few are capable of remembering who they truly are after such a long time. Some would forget who they once were and choose to forever remain inside the painting.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#2")]
[name="Saga"]My, how frightening.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]Yet you are not afraid at all.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]

[Character(name="char_362_Saga#4")]
[name="Saga"]The old fisher at the summit of Mount Sky, the weaver by the banks of the Pu-kuei River, the halberd wielder of the Wu-chieh Plains, the lady innkeeper of the Lungmen Inn... and now the storyteller of the P'o-shan Village... Thou hast reminded me countless of times.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Yet I chose to deceive myself and continued to indulge in my pleasures, never to wake from my dream. I suppose I must apologize. It must have been tedious to keep me alive in the painting.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]Pray be at ease. You came to the mountain when the autumn winds were yet blowing. 'Tis merely the beginning of winter now. It was but a brief dream.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#3")]
[name="Saga"]Hoh! I was worried I would be reprimanded for my sluggish behavior. Little did I know it was but a brief period of time. That certainly puts me at ease.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]You already knew of your predicament when you reached Mount Sky, that it was merely a painting. Why waste your time?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#4")]
[name="Saga"]For I saw the truth of Dusk Beauty Flying to the Moon, and I could not well cease thinking about it... A madwoman took matters into her hands and sought to reclaim her true love from the heavens. 'Tis an act of pure lunacy, yet it overwhelms me with a sense of regret...
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]Hmm... What if I tell you Dusk Beauty's willpower was an addition I made to the painting—that it is of my own making?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#4")]
[name="Saga"]All the nations of this world possess a great many legends, classics, literature, and myths, many of which can be called fabricated. The common folk are not likely to ever experience the machinations written therein. Should we disregard their lessons because they are mere fiction?
[name="Saga"]I think 'tis absurd to do so.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]You are a strange one.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]There is but a fine line between great and strange. I appreciate your compliment.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]...Hah.
[name="Storyteller"]You are just like your master. He's old, yet he has the heart of a child, a clear mind.
[name="Storyteller"]You've helped me pass the time... Out of respect for your master, very well, I shall grant you an audience with me.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#2")]
[name="Saga"]Um, an audience?
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]Haha, you cannot possibly believe you've awakened by waltzing in here?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#2")]
[name="Saga"]*gasp*...! Am I yet within the painting?
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#3")]
[name="Storyteller"]No need to feel ashamed. This is merely how it's meant to be.

[Character(name="char_362_Saga#2")]
[name="Saga"]I... I...
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#4")]
[name="Saga"]I thought that by surveying the sceneries of these hundred-and-some scrolls, I, too, could walk the journey that thou once walked. Yet... 'Twas but an insignificant fraction of the landscapes thou hast sketched...
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#4")]
[name="Dusk"]Know that there are those who never accept their mistakes and find themselves content with dying here.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#2")]
[name="Saga"]That I can understand...
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#5")]
[name="Dusk"]That's not what you wanted to ask.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Oh, right, I was startled into forgetfulness. My apologies.
[name="Saga"]Master, I have once laid my eyes upon the 'Scene of Crude Mounts Utmost Risen' at my head priest's garret. Though at the time I thought there was meaning hidden therein, I could not quite put my finger on it.
[name="Saga"]I asked the head priest, and he had me leave the monastery to seek out the answer. I have since traveled all over the lands, and though I have since found parts of the answer myself, the ways of the world has me yet confused.
[name="Saga"]Since I am blessed with the fortune to meet thee in thy flesh, I thought I would—
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#4")]
[name="Dusk"]If you've had your ideas, why ask me?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]I wish merely to learn from thy explanation for my own betterment and to fill in the blanks... To tell the truth, the painting's true meaning eludes me still. Pray tell, wherefore was the end of the waterfall just one swift stroke, leaving naught but a swath of emptiness?
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#5")]
[name="Dusk"]What do you think?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#4")]
[name="Saga"]—Crude mounts utmost risen. The scenery within the scroll extends endlessly. The waterfall soars into the skies, leaving naught but white. 'Tis a way to depict the great mountains and rivers undepictable within the scroll...
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#4")]
[name="Dusk"]......
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Hrm... This is merely conjecture. I am hoping you could do away with the secrecy and reveal the truth. 'Tis making me blush.
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#4")]
[name="Dusk"]Beauty, especially that of an art piece, is in the eye of the beholder. It falls on you to find your own interpretation.
[name="Dusk"]Nonetheless... You racked your brains so for only that?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Much of what we do in life is seeking answers.
[name="Saga"]If not for this matter gnawing at my mind, I would not have had the fortune to feast my eyes upon thy landscapes within the scrolls.
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#4")]
[name="Dusk"]I suppose so.
[name="Dusk"]Alas, the stroke you are asking was one that I began at whim and also one that I ended at whim. That's all.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#2")]
[name="Saga"]Huh?
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#4")]
[name="Dusk"]By the time I got to the waterfall, I no longer wanted to continue, and so I stopped there. I took a look afterwards and thought it was rather picturesque, so I gave it a name and sent it your master's way.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#2")]
[name="Saga"]I—
[name="Saga"]—I could never have imagined!
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#5")]
[name="Dusk"]Disappointed?
[name="Dusk"]Having spent such a long time in the painting, and you ended up with quite possibly the most boring answer—
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Not at all. Leaving aside all that I have learned inside the scroll, thy answer is most interesting!
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#4")]
[name="Saga"]Drawn on a whim, and stopped on a whim... I once thought that there is meaning to all things upon this world. As time passed, I became far too entrenched in my search, unable to pluck myself out.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Right, right. We need not be so focused on the meaning behind everything... If there is but one answer, to repeatedly scrutinize would merely be a futile exercise.
[name="Saga"]I had heard from my master an aphorism: 'Where there was naught at first, from whence could dust have emerged.' Mayhaps it means the same thing?
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#5")]
[name="Dusk"]...Hah.
[name="Dusk"]Everyone has their own interpretations. As long as you understand that, it's not necessarily a bad thing to be cocky.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Oh, I shall keep that in mind. Many thanks.
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#5")]
[name="Dusk"]When I gave your master this piece, I told him merely three words, 'Crude Mounts Utmost.' The 'Risen' in its name... is his interpretation.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#2")]
[name="Saga"]'Risen?'
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#5")]
[name="Dusk"]Do you know what your master saw in it?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]He gazed not upon its landscapes with thee?
[Character(name="char_2015_dusk_1#5")]
[name="Dusk"]He didn't.
