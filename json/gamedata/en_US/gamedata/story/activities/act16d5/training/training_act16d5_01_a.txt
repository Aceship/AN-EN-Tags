[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_lava2")] Huh? Is that Melantha? Why is Melantha here? She can't withstand that many enemies!
[Tutorial(focusX=240, focusY=100, focusWidth=250, focusHeight=250, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \

Chill out, chill... look at those enemies. See their <@tu.kw>black and white</> coloring? That's how you tell if they're <@tu.kw>'Hui' or 'Ming'</>.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_lava2")] Nian?! What are you doing here?
[Tutorial(focusX=-255, focusY=230, focusWidth=80, focusHeight=80, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_nian", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
Now pay attention to this tile. It's called a <@tu.kw>'Mark of Hui and Ming,'</> and Operators <@tu.kw>deployed</> on it will gain an <@tu.kw>identical</> 'Ming' or 'Hui' attribute.
