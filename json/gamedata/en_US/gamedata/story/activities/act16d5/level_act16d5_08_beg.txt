[name="Dawn"]Saga is such an bright girl.
[name="Dawn"]Again and again, she protects the things she knows can't be damaged. I wonder if that means they will grow sick of this pointless exercise and give up on that righteousness one of these days?
[name="Dawn"]I suppose she will. After all, if you can restore broken porcelain, then it's not going to be much of a heartbreak at all to see it shatter into pieces.

[name="Lava"]No idea. All Saga said before she shut herself in was something like, 'Leave it to me...'

[Character(name="avg_npc_139#1")]

[name="Dawn"]There have been very few people who managed to wake up from the scroll on their own volition. Actually, I should say there has never been anyone who has managed to do it.
[name="Dawn"]But... maybe.
[name="Dawn"]Ms. Lava, have you heard of 'firecrackers?'
[name="Dawn"]It's a time-honored tradition in Yen. As you can imagine, it was at first—
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#4")]
[name="Lava"]—For warding off ancient monsters?
[Character(name="avg_npc_139#4")]

[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_144#3")]
[name="Kroos"]Right, now I remember...
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#5")]
[name="Lava"]Please don't remember.
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#3")]
[name="Kroos"]This is straight out of 'Ancient Forge,' isn't it? I remember something about Nian being scared of firecrackers. The Dark Devastator in the end used cannons as well—
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#2")]
[name="Lava"]—Aahhhh, I can't hear you!
[name="Lava"]Dawn! What do firecrackers have to do with this situation?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_139#3")]
[name="Dawn"]Hm? Oh... I was going to say the Ink Spirits are actually scared of firecrackers.
[name="Dawn"]If we hang some firecrackers up at the village's entrance, they will naturally stay away.
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#4")]
[name="Lava"]Really?!
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#4")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Wow, what a lifesaver! My back has been hurting me the past day and a half! At last, I can take the day off from looking for monsters!
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Now, without further ado, let us take to the market—
[Character(name="avg_npc_139#4")]
[name="Dawn"]You won't find them in the market.
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#2")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]—Quite right. How do we procure some, then?
[Character(name="avg_npc_139#4")]
[name="Dawn"]Well, there is a way...
[name="Dawn"]Do you know why firecrackers are called as such?
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#5")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Because the earliest Yen people thought to commemorate their fallen liege's exploits by setting bamboo on fire, and memorialize the great war with its crackling sounds.
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#1")]
[name="Kroos"]You know your stuff.
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#4")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Haha, I'm merely well-read on the subject.
