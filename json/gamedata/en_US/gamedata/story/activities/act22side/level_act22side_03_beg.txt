[name="Plain-Dressed Bard"]History records that out of a sense the war between the Draco and Aslan had become far too protracted and bitter, the final King Gaeil signed a peace treaty.
[name="Plain-Dressed Bard"]Legends say he opted to melt down his soldiers' weapons as a sign of his determination, but his subjects could hardly accept such a defeat. Thus they conspired to revolt, and assassinated the monarch.
[name="Plain-Dressed Bard"]But just as you've referenced in many a speech, a single assassination is not enough to extinguish the Red Dragon's whole bloodline.
[Character(name="avg_npc_727_1#1$1")]
[name="Earl of Warwick"]No matter how the Victorians write the history books, they cannot change what facts we've seen with our own eyes.
[name="Earl of Warwick"]The Aslan promised to share Victoria's kingship with the Draco, yet didn't hand over the crown for nearly a century.
[name="Earl of Warwick"]With the lions' ambitions so conspicuous to this point, I wonder. Six blade marks stabbed King Gaeil through. How many of them were by Aslan hands?
[name="Earl of Warwick"]Not to mention the Draco king fleeing the royal capital after, fate unknown. And the Kingdom of Tara without its ruler was subjugated under Victorian sovereign authority, as if a matter of course.
[name="Earl of Warwick"]I presume it wasn't his own subjects who prevented the Draco's return to the city.
[Character(name="avg_npc_727_1#8$1")]
[name="Earl of Warwick"]This is why I very much enjoy your works based on the Tarans' own ballads. You've led the people to see more of history's truth.
[Character(name="avg_npc_239")]
[name="Plain-Dressed Bard"]Thank you for your appreciation.
[name="Plain-Dressed Bard"]To write this story, I saw plays performed in the country, and paid a visit to some wandering minstrels who'd inherited the Taran tradition.
[name="Plain-Dressed Bard"]—But what struck me most wasn't the endangerment of Taran culture. It was how so many lives were just slipping away.
[name="Plain-Dressed Bard"]Perhaps you believe the Tarans' ideal nation, and a border with Victoria, are necessary for the Taran people to be saved.
[name="Plain-Dressed Bard"]But I think, if we ourselves can live better, if we can plant seeds of ideas for the many Tarans who can't read...
[name="Plain-Dressed Bard"]Won't we have won then and there, against the Victorians who want us trapped in ignorance and poverty all our lives?
