[name="Harmonie"]Yes, I'm very well aware the County Trent won't be changing its entire course just for a single order, which is why we're willing to push back the delivery date and wait for the nomadic city to come closer.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Of course, only mines with royal approval could provide Originium fuel of such high purity, hence my being so very thankful for the Marquess of Trent's friendly attitude to us.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]I imagine we're all very happy with this business partnership.

[name="Harmonie"]Your secretary has left with the signed contract, Mr. Hughes.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]He'll deliver it back to the office. Please, I ask you trust him to properly handle such a vital agreement.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]No, no no no, I don't mean to doubt his management abilities.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#6",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]But rather, doesn't this imply you have more pressing matters to discuss with me personally than the contract, mmm?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]After all, you did choose this secluded little getaway, and dismiss your servants too.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]Quite right, it's no surprise you'd surmise, haha. I had all these arrangements laid out specifically to convey my good faith to you. My wish is that...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]our ensuing conversation will be founded on our mutual friendship from our time studying at the Royal Guard together, Loâ€”
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Shh.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]How funny you should remember that name.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]Haha... well, you do know how famous she was at the ball.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#6",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Oh, my, does it not make sense that her type could topple over and not get up while dead drunk in some godforsaken place?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]Yes, I trust the vast majority have forgotten all about her. Whether it was a true accident or some other party's orchestration, everyone knew not to stick their noses into it.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]I much thank you for so lavishly feigning surprise.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]My surprise happens to contain a kernel of sincerity.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Bringing up a name vanished from the school, a name with no record anywhere in Victoria of existing... You're practically bidding 'spectres' to come.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]Hm, you're not wrong.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]Then let me be bold. Why, may I ask, did you contact me of your own accord? I'm no more than a minor aristocrat making minor deals with all the mercantile breadth. I couldn't do anything about the info you've hinted at.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]Miss Informant, are you looking to circumvent your higher-ups to please your own swollen ambitions, or are you...
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]If you've made full sense of this conversation, it wouldn't do me any more favors playing the fool, would it.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]The gist of it is, I'm here specifically, given our previous time studying at the Royal Guard, to offer you... and the two who've been searching for the spectre force this whole time, a little warning.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]You knew...
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Mm, yes, of course I knew they came to see you, plus that you helped them pursue a batch of Originium products shipped to County Hillock half a year ago.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Some people would sayyyy... you've let slip a little too much.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]......
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]I understand how sensitive your position is, and how multifaceted your responsibilities. Rest assured, I would absolutely never leak any of this classified information to anyone.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]As for those two rash students of mine, I'll give them a tact warning to quit while they're ahead.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]And I'll leave your staff a little head start on their investigation into your order's whereabouts.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]I appreciate your kindness, but being the paltry merchant I am, I fear I shouldn't be privy to too much.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]No, please, drop the humbleness. After all, you're the vice-chair of your commerce coalition. I'd think the Earl that backs you would very much care about any info you gather doing business.
[name="Harmonie"]Is the Iron Duke really so worth depending on, given his sheer silence up to now? You know, it's about time he decided where he stood.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]â€”
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_177",focus="r")]
[name="Hughes"]Harmonie, you're not telling me you're Victoria's... no, just who are you servingâ€”
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]â€”Mr. Hughes, I'd be very happy to receive the contents of our next contract from you... sooner, rather than later.
