[name="Fischer"]That's fine. Why don't we start with accounts of your recent incidents?
[name="Fischer"]You haven't caused serious injury to anyone. Even the arson at the barracks resulted in no deaths nor casualties, with only some supplies lost to fire.
[name="Fischer"]Most Tarans are driven by their hatred of the Victorians to commit graver crimes. Your methods, in contrast, have been very mild.
[Character(name="avg_4017_puzzle_1#1$1",name2="avg_1020_reed2_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Fischer"]Some witnesses even attest how you tried to fend off the Dublinn soldiers.
[name="Fischer"]Do you admit to all this?
[Character(name="avg_4017_puzzle_1#1$1",name2="avg_1020_reed2_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Reed"]I can only admit—I by no means wish to harm others.
[Character(name="avg_4017_puzzle_1#1$1",name2="avg_1020_reed2_1#7$1",focus=1)]
[name="Fischer"]Good. I can believe that. You have a fair conscience in you.
[name="Fischer"]Now, if we can turn our attention to the quietened fowlbeasts...
[Character(name="avg_4017_puzzle_1#7$1",name2="avg_1020_reed2_1#7$1",focus=1)]
[name="Fischer"]...It seems your Dublinn friends are here to save you.

[name="Reed"]No... No.
[name="Reed"]I can't go back...
[Character(name="avg_4017_puzzle_1#10$1",name2="avg_1020_reed2_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Fischer"]Go back? Oh, you mean—back to your life as a shadow?
[name="Fischer"]Back to the kind of life surrounded by smoldering corpses, where the ashes of the dead coat the city streets?
[Character(name="avg_4017_puzzle_1#1$1",name2="avg_1020_reed2_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Fischer"]To someone blessed with a conscience, it must be a very painful life.
[name="Fischer"]But it so happens you have a chance right now. You can make your own decision.
[name="Fischer"]Accept our protection. Your past crimes will be looked into no further.

Brandishing her piledriver spear, Bagpipe's gaze is away from the tent. Behind her stands Ch'en, and Ch'en's eyes, however, widen for an instant.
With not a sound, the tent over the interrogation turns to ashes.
A beam of flames bolts through the dark night, to then immediately vanish without a trace.
