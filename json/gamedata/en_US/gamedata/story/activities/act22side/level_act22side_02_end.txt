[name="'The Brigadier'"]With The Leader's plans progressed to this stage, there is no real difference between my identity as part of Duke of Wellington's guard, and that as an officer of Dublinn.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]Seeing as you have Caster's people surveilling you, they must have long gained possession of that information.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]We have little nibbles of Dublinn forces cropping up outside the cities, and the rumors of a major Dublinn force passing through... All put on show for them.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Sprinkle in a few mysterious trade orders, and now even the gossiping merchants know the Iron Duke has some design or other for this city.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Everyone is quietly making the rounds, frantically guessing what the Duke is borrowing Trent as a stage for.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]Very much as The Leader expected.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Yes, if they'd realized our true aim too soon, and every Duke learned of The Leader's resolution in advance, I fear Oak Grove's outskirts would be in the same merry state Londinium is.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Say, are they more scared of the Sarkaz, or of the Tarans?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]Trying to pit Tarans against Sarkaz? You have no right to make such jokes, Feline of Victoria.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]...I hear 'The Spy' is dead.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#2",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Mmm, yes, and we've had access to far less intel from inside Londinium ever since. It really is a shame.
[name="Harmonie"]It's not just Sarkaz in there. You have some... fairly interesting powers in hibernation.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#7",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Impulsiveness? My, scant few people would ever think THAT of me.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]You should perish thoughts of offering Mandragora survival.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]She was used by 'The Elocutionist', to try and fracture Dublinn. She was meant to die in County Hillock along with those six traitors.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Mandragora was the one 'The Spy' most trusted. Executing her before confirming if 'The Spy' had turned his coat, well, that wouldn't have been the wise move.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]Excuses.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]Even if it wasn't worth myself or you in person, the task of supporting 'The Spy' should have gone to someone more dependable.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#6",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Oh? Come to speak of us, you never sat well with me. Don't you find it such good news that I've never had the chance to kill you?

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]You can't be acting rashly before the Duke and The Leader make their final decision.
[name="Harmonie"]If you can discern the importance of Londinium intel, then of course I can. But whether we ultimately march on Londinium or not, that's still an unknown variable. 
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]Hinging upon our progress collaborating with the Duke?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]And meanwhile, all our errant representatives were circling thousands of kilometers out, patiently pulling through several weeks just to tell the Duke one single thing.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]Harmonie, you'd best stand on The Leader's side.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Or else?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]Mandragora is dead. I can stop investigating your whim to assist her.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_723_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="'The Brigadier'"]The Leader has assigned control of her whereabouts to you. Don't let personal considerations affect you any further, Harmonie. You have little leeway left to fail.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#2",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Oh, you do fantasize far too much about the emotional life of a professional spy.

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_228_1#1",focus="l")]
[name="Harmonie"]Fine, fine, you can stop boring into me with your eyes, 'Brigadier', unless you want to help by applying my makeup. I do have a dinner party to attend.
