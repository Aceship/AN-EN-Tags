[name="Taran Refugee"]Bell rings, we snuff the lamps, and fires go out too. If someone in the barrens lights a fire to herd beasts at this hour, you can see it clear as day from miles and miles away.
[character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Taran Refugee"]But muck-ups like today only happened once the new rules got stricter. Those night patrol tossers see anyone in the street, they snatch 'em.

[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#1$1")]
[name="Fionn"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#1$1")]
[name="Fionn"]We had a little confrontation with the patrol. They sent a warrant out for us.

[name="Taran Refugee"]Fionn!
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#1$1")]
[name="Fionn"]Let me talk, Fergal. I can feel, this lady's a good person.
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#1$1")]
[name="Fionn"]When the patrol came here to make arrests, they summoned everyone who had a record. And then they started with the beatings, so we fought back...
[character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Taran Refugee"]You didn't, Fionn. Don't give yourself credit.
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#6$1")]
[name="Fionn"]Ugh, okay.
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#1$1")]
[name="Fionn"]We hadn't done all that bad, really, truth told. One family ran after they couldn't pay tax dues, so the patrol was dragging all their relatives in by the scruff for questioning. Fergal was brewing a little moonshine just for himself, and I'd missed some formalities while selling stuff.
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#1$1")]
[name="Fionn"]*sigh* We'd always owned up properly too, whatever it was. It all got too much that day.
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#1$1")]
[name="Fionn"]It wasn't just us two who scarpered once the patrol started beating. It's ten or so of us, all summoned that day by the army. We all ran at once.
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#1$1")]
[name="Fionn"]But if the army wants someone, there's no escaping it. That lot won't change their tune just because someone's word says they're innocent.

[character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Taran Refugee"]Shame we let the third one do a runner, or else the army'd never know about what we did.
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#2$1")]
[name="Fionn"]Hey! We wouldn't be in such a miserable spot if we'd had one night more of a head start.
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#6$1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#6$1")]
[name="Fionn"]We didn't even nab the medicine. Oran's cut's just festering away, and he's... I can't take it, I can't.
[character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Taran Refugee"]You drop the bloody idea. You think they'd make it easy on you?
[name="Taran Refugee"]Bloody wouldn't. They'd torture you first, crush your spirits.
[name="Taran Refugee"]Two minutes with someone like you, and they'd get everything about us pouring out.
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#6$1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#1$1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#1$1")]
[name="Fionn"]We were here planning to buy it, honest.
[character(name="avg_npc_242")]
[name="Taran Refugee"]But we knew in our heads, all the shops'd shut the moment lights-out sounded. We'd never make it in time beforehand.
[character(name="avg_npc_725_1#2$1")]
[name="Fionn"]So we got a rough idea of when the patrol changes shifts, er, and we smashed through a shop window... I thought they wouldn't notice around about then.
