[name="Fischer"]After the conclusion of the incident, Dublinn successfully purged all unstable elements from the city, and further gained the surrounding Taran populace's support, escaping intact directly under Victoria's nose.

She rushes out.
Like those Victorian soldiers in the daytime did, like Ch'en did, these people that have ceased to be can be knocked down again, so long as every attack comes swiftly enough, ferociously enough.
Until they'll sleep peacefully in the soil of Tara, never called to stand again.

As if her brother is about to give him both his hands, like when Victoria's police accosted them in younger times, shielding her in his embrace.
And then she sees his familiar face all so clearly.
His forehead drips no blood, and his eyes turn no look to his little sister.
Those eyes gaze to the distant, vague horizon, a rage of firelight longing, burning within.
—Just like the night he decided he'd seek out Dublinn.
And Dublinn soldiers surround them. Selmon blankly, dazedly, reaches a hand out to the man before her.
Admiration, aspiration, guilt. Regret.
All swallowed up by the ice-cold fire that her fingertips brush.
