They leave behind Originium ember when they're defeated, which will resurrect them if not cleared quickly.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Embers do not deal damage even when we are in contact, but they have <@tu.kw>Invisibility</> and must be <@tu.kw>attacked several times in order to remove them</>.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_melan")] I'll be there soon.
