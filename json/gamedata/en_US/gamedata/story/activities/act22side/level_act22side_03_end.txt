Bagpipe relaxes and lies back on the hay pile, lightly humming a folksong she learned just a while ago from the farmers.

Unusual fire.
All too likely to be a coincidence, but all too familiar of a description to her.
Could it be... Loughshinny?
Harmonie is stunned.
'The Brigadier's' warning has certainly roused some anxieties deep in her heart. Ever since that Rhodes Island ship had sailed into Victoria, she'd been absent any hold of information on Loughshinny.
Someone, without a doubt, had been helping Rhodes Island cover their tracks. Clearly, this pharmaceutical company was not as simple as she first assumed.
And on the same coin, a Loughshinny aboard Rhodes Island would be a Loughshinny immensely difficult for the rest of Victoria's powers to find.
So why... why would Loughshinny leave the ship?
Why would she surface somewhere so close to Eblana?
