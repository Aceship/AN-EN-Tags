She has to run. The fog is giving her a chance. She knows the strategy of turning a battle into an uncontrolled brawl well. All she has to do is take her spear up and spur on the flames.
But what comes after?
She is Dublinn's '<i>Leader</i>.'
She stands for Dublinn's flames. She set light to the land in swaths. She took lives upon lives.
She made illusory promises, all in her own voice. She proclaimed, time and again, she would bring about a new age, one belonging to the Tarans.

She is a Draco.
Her parents died on the snowiest of festival nights for this bloodline. She and her sister traveled to one city after another, living the childhoods that ambitious politicians who aimed to restore the monarchy had in mind for them.
She was born with her flames. Even now, her veins and organs can feel that scorching pain.
Where must she run to escape from that fate?
Once, she woke up on a sickbed aboard Rhodes Island. There, she laid on the bed and read. In the books were descriptions of Victoria's exquisite peace, of Tara's gentle, melodious madrigals.
But past her window, there outside, her injured allies would walk.
