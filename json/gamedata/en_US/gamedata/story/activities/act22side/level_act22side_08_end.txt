She'd imagined the flames of wrath bursting from her aching chest, burning away the shell and identity she had been given, liberating her from the shackles of her self.
But when she truly went to touch her flames, desiring to hold them, she suddenly wondered if she never had control over them in the first place.

[name="Eblana"]Right now, we are docked in Oak Grove, once a Taran community burned to ashes by a tyrant's flames.
[name="Eblana"]Perhaps those with keen enough eyesight will be able to see Tara's palace destroyed by a Catastrophe over yonder. Such are the scars left behind on the Taran people.
[name="Eblana"]However, it is hardly our intent to recover Tara's ancient lands, or reconstruct our history out of its tatters.
[name="Eblana"]We are wanderers in a new land, and the road I wish to take you down is one of constructing a new era and a new order.

[name="Eblana"]—This battleship's next stop will be at the port of Londinium.
[name="Eblana"]Naturally, we are not going to compete for Victoria's crown. We simply are taking our destiny back from the Victorians, into our own hands.
[name="Eblana"]Our eyes are open now—we clearly see that our suffering is rooted in the dominion and servitude that Victoria imposed upon Tara. As such, we ought to let Victoria deny the legitimacy of its own past actions.
[name="Eblana"]The war may not end in Londinium, but surely we do not fear a long and bitter fight?
[name="Eblana"]The flames have already been kindled.
[name="Eblana"]They will burn away the ancient order of this land, taking our rotten shackles along with it.
[name="Eblana"]As for the new order that shall be established, I turn to all of you.
[name="Eblana"]I implore all of you, regardless of whether you're Taran or Victorian, regardless of who you are or where you came from, to simply fight for the glory of justice, for the unprecedented era to come.
[name="Eblana"]Until the Tarans are free to compose their own dreams, just as the Victorians are, nothing shall stand in our way.

[name="Moran"]But, Reed, what are we fighting for? 'For the survival of the Tarans' is simply too vague.
[name="Reed"]Mm... In past times, I always thought—that life was so fragile.
[name="Reed"]Upon this great land, many a thing waits to take our lives from us. Everything we do is no more—than a desperate struggle, a stand, against death.
[name="Reed"]And in the end, one from which nobody can emerge victorious.
[name="Reed"]If I concerned myself too much with people's lives, how would I ever be able to come face-to-face—with the all too ubiquitous sacrifices, with the sea of unmarked graves?
[name="Reed"]Yet—the weight of a life... is immense. That is something I can't escape from.

[name="Reed"]We cannot defeat death. But we can—and we should—give dignity to the living.
[name="Reed"]I believe... that the people of Tara should have a warm fire at night, and wine in their glasses when they sing their songs.
[name="Reed"]There should be a day, when the people of Tara no longer have to run away, or bid farewell to their families and lovers.
[name="Reed"]I hope—for the people of Tara to have their own homeland, where they can live in peace.
[name="Reed"]I hope... that all those we've parted ways with—will all be reunited there.
