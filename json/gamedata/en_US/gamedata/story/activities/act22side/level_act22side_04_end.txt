I know that in my body is a fire. If I feel for it, I can feel it burning me. After so long, the pain of it comes to me even before my thoughts do.
Our parents warned us to take these flames we were born with and swallow them down, hide them away, and never let them be seen by anyone.
But I knew—how my sister would secretly burn whatever she didn't want, and then she'd get something better for it.
Can I do that too?

That morning, I thought I'd try acting like her, talking to my parents in her tone of voice.

She and I had the same appearance and voice, and wore the same clothes, so why couldn't I disguise myself as her?
[name="Loughshinny"]I want to read the sequel to the Steam Knights adventures... since—I don't want anyone asking me, how come a Victorian wouldn't like stories about the Steam Knights.

[name="Selmon"]...Meddling little Fionn. Did he tell you about the first time I ever saw Dublinn?
[name="Selmon"]We were in the city, me and my brother. If we were in good moods, we'd line up to see if any of the pubs needed last-minute waiters or what-have-you. If we were in bad moods, we'd hit Viccies' windows with our catapults.
[Character(name="avg_npc_724_1#8$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_724_1#10$1")]
[name="Selmon"]Then, one day, there was this injured woman lying in an alley who shouted at me in Taran, wanted me to deliver a letter for her.
[name="Selmon"]We guessed who she was. I delivered it, and found her a place to hide.
[Character(name="avg_npc_724_1#7$1")]
[name="Selmon"]I told her, of all the scummiest Victorians in this city, the number one would be that one with the tiny moustache who issued all the decrees.
[name="Selmon"]Bloody, Originium product taxes, alcohol taxes to 'target Taran drunks', ordinances to round up unemployed Tarans and house them in one place, he was the one on telly delivering all of that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_724_1#10$1")]
[name="Selmon"]And then there was the army man stationed in the alleys. I couldn't do nothing but watch him beat all those people to death, and if I'd stared at him a moment more, he would've taken me away.
[name="Selmon"]If she and her spectre force wanted marks to attack, then those two had to be on the list.
[name="Selmon"]But I was wrong, she responded, it wasn't Dublinn's aim to retaliate against Victorians in Tarans' stead.
[name="Selmon"]My brother told her which noble had the biggest house, which had the poshest dinner parties, which had a treasure hoard enough to arm an army, support a plate's farmers.
[name="Selmon"]That was even more wrong, she said. Dublinn wasn't stealing from the Victorians to give to the Tarans.
[name="Selmon"]And she said, if all we do is kill a few people, and seat ourselves in their positions, it won't make things better for the Tarans, it'll just make us become them.
[name="Selmon"]Just like how Tarans who learned Victorian etiquette, copied Victorian accents, could pass as Victorian nobles...
[Character(name="avg_1020_reed2_1#1$1")]
[name="Reed"]...Then, did she tell you—what it was Dublinn wanted?
[Character(name="avg_npc_724_1#2$1")]
