[Character(name="char_248_mgllan")]
[name="Magallan"]   ......
[name="Magallan"]   Well that's weird.
[name="Magallan"]   I guess I shouldn't have let Mayer play with the sign-in system. What a weird function...
[name="Magallan"]   Welp, anyway, let's get to work!
[name="Magallan"]   This is our last survey of the year. Let's make sure there's nothing new.
[name="Magallan"]   By now, all regions marked for survey are done. Once they finish their other tasks, they'll start on the trip back.
[name="Magallan"]   Phew. Done.
[name="Magallan"]   I am really no good at writing reports. Let's hear the audio.

[name="Device"]   (lively feminine voice) Hi , Maggie! Today is the one hundred, eighty, seventh day of your survey.
[Character(name="char_248_mgllan")]
[name="Magallan"]  Wow, I've been out here a while. The time really flies.
[Character]
[name="Device"]   (lively feminine voice) You have been out so long, shouldn't you head back? Everyone misses you.
[Character(name="char_248_mgllan")]
[name="Magallan"]  Huh?! Was that in there before... Don't tell me Mayer snuck in some new parameters.
[name="Magallan"]  Well, it's a cute little surprise either way. How nice.
[name="Magallan"]  But, as for going back, I think...

[name="Magallan"]  This snowstorm looks like it'll last at least a week. Good thing I've got plenty of supplies.
[name="Magallan"]  Let's take another look at the to do list. I think I remember a few things still need doing.
[name="Magallan"]  Let's see here. Right. Sample collection is done. Searching for clues in the ruins, I think we can call that done.
[name="Magallan"]  Nothing much new, compared to last year. If only we had a discovery like the year before.
[name="Magallan"]  It's pretty normal, but I bet the section chief still chews me out for getting greedy.
[name="Magallan"]  Nothing here either... Oh? Here's a blank. Low temperature test of new materials... oh.
[name="Magallan"]  I totally forgot!! Where did I put that new material?!

[name="Magallan"] Now to test hardness.
[name="Magallan"] Hey!
[name="Magallan"] Well, no problem. Into the experiment chamber you go.
[name="Magallan"] Thank goodness I put it in my jacket...
[name="Magallan"] With the blizzard and all, I guess I can just put it outside the door and see how it holds up in a low temperature environment.
[name="Magallan"] I think the current temperature out there should be right.

[name="Magallan"]  C- could it be some kind of snow ghost?
[name="Magallan"]  No way. I just have to open the door and take another look. I have to answer this question with science!!
[name="Magallan"]  There's no such thing as ghosts! And I'm not so cold that I'm hallucinating!

[name="Magallan"] My codename is Magallan! Rhine Lab Field Specialist, assigned to Research Outpost #420...
[name="Magallan"] It's only me here, at the moment.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] I see.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Simone, why are you here? Did you get caught in the storm...?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] I was entrusted with the search for a certain individual.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Search? In the Northlands? There's no one here. For all the months I've been, I've seen maybe a couple living organisms.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]

[name="Magallan"] Why are you looking for her?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] This storm will last for some time, which should delay her movements. I came here to retrieve her.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Oh, really? Do you mean me?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] I am not certain.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] R- right. So you're not here for me. But the weather as it is, it really doesn't bother you?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] The Sami... rather, I am familiar with snow.
[name="Simone"] But if the weather continues to deteriorate, many things will change in unpredictable ways.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Yeah. I knew this storm would last a while, but I didn't think it would be this intense.
[name="Magallan"] I wanted to wait for the wind to die down a bit... We would have to speed things up like this.
[name="Magallan"] According to the calendar and my observations, tomorrow would be the best time!
[name="Magallan"] And we have enough supplies. I really did well.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] All these supplies are for you alone?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Oh, no. These are for all the people living at this research station to hold out until next year's survey season.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] ...oh?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] If you need to live here for a while, you can use these supplies too.
[name="Magallan"] But you can't touch my equipment!

[name="Simone"] Oh. Okay.

[name="Magallan"] Good, well, now that that's decided, let's get packing!
[name="Magallan"] Sorry, Simone, there's a few things I have to prepare.

[name="Simone"] You don't get lonely?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] I do! But I don't think loneliness and happiness are mutually exclusive.
[name="Magallan"] I know my colleagues are all waiting for me to come back. And I know these ice fields hold so many amazing secrets waiting to be unlocked. So it's not that bad.
[name="Magallan"] Sometimes I get lonely. But most of the time, I'm really very happy!
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] To be alone... is very scary. A life like this... I don't even know what to say.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] I know it's not for everyone.
[name="Magallan"] Being an explorer isn't easy!
[name="Magallan"] Err, ahem, being a scientist!
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] You are... truly optimistic.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Hehe. To borrow the words of one of the greats: "An explorer's best friend is loneliness!"
[name="Magallan"] Oh, but the section chief said I have this bad habit of talking to myself. Do I? I don't think I do?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] That is not what I mean. My meaning is, do you not fear infection?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Oh. No, I don't need to worry about that. Rhine Lab's research has proven time and again that Oripathy transmission from person to person is not nearly as easy as most people think.
[name="Magallan"] Even though nobody seems to listen... Sigh.
[name="Magallan"] I have lots of Infected friends and colleagues. It's no big deal.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] ...Really?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Yep. Really. Everyone at Rhine Lab Medical is really proud of what we've accomplished!
[name="Magallan"] But when it comes to Infected stuff, we can't compare to a pharmaceutical company called "Rhodes Island..."
[name="Magallan"] It pisses off some of my colleagues, but it's the truth. They do really amazing work on Oripathy over there.
[name="Magallan"] That's why Rhine Lab signed a cooperation agreement with Rhodes Island. I'm actually going there myself!
[name="Magallan"] I'm pretty excited. I have no idea what it's like, but I really hope I can get some really good research done! I thought I'd be cooped up in a lab forever...
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] You really like to talk, don't you?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Obviously! I really like talking to other people. But, um, if I start to talk your ear off, you can just tell me. I'll quiet down...
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] Not at all. I like you talking about all these things I don't know.

[name="Magallan"] Oh. Huh. I'm blushing a little...
[name="Magallan"] You know, Simone, you could go to Rhodes Island for treatment! Hey, I could even take you there!
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] No one else is coming in this weather.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Simone, you just showed up in this weather like ten minutes ago.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] I am different. I am not an explorer, Magallan.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Phew... this heater is heavy...
[name="Magallan"] This outpost is even more important.
[name="Magallan"] For an explorer, base camps like this outpost are lifesaving nodes. If this outpost goes down, an explorer who runs out of supplies or gets lost might come here and find only death.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] Okay, but, since the time it was built, up until I got here, has anyone else come by?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Not a one.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] Then what does it matter?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] It matters.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] How are you so sure?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Because there will be someone coming by. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not until the next research season, maybe not for another couple of years.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] You are just making baseless assumptions. Magallan, it is dangerous out there.
[name="Simone"] No one is coming. At least not until the dry season. No explorer is coming.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Simone... You said you're not an explorer, didn't you?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] That is correct.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Well, different explorers make different choices.
[name="Magallan"] Some of them might choose to come here when it's nice and calm, to explore the length and breadth of the Northlands. No one's done it yet, but people are always trying.
[name="Magallan"] And some of them might come here at its most dangerous, to see how the land shapes and changes, to record what they see and bring it back to civilization.
[name="Magallan"] The Black Flow of Bolivar, the highland plains of Kazimierz, the undersea volcanoes of Iberia... there was a time when no one had seen them either.
[name="Magallan"] But now the explorers have been and gone, planted their flags.
[name="Magallan"] And there are still many places in the world no one has set foot on yet. But that's all it means. Not yet.
[name="Magallan"] Today, I set foot on this ice field. That means more people will come in the future.
[name="Magallan"] And we have no idea under what circumstances they'll be coming.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] And if no one else comes in your lifetime?
[name="Simone"] After you go back, won't this station fall into ruin?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] I can't give up. There's always that minute chance that some nonexistant explorer might come along two months later.
[name="Magallan"] Simone... You have to understand. I, Magallan, believe in exploration. I believe in explorers.
[name="Magallan"] One day, our footprints will cover this entire land.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] ...You have put your hopes in a future that may not come to pass. Will you not be disappointed?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] No big deal. An explorer spends her whole life discovering, and her whole life being disappointed.
[name="Magallan"] No explorer's discovery is purely her own. Every one of us stands on the shoulders of all the explorers who came before us. Every discovery is connected to a long and storied past.
[name="Magallan"] Like, I'm only here in this ice field because of a story I heard as a child.
[name="Magallan"] But I know in my heart that even if the thing I'm looking for doesn't exist, everything I do still has meaning.
[name="Magallan"] Even if it's just some empty, disappointing, imaginary meaning.
[name="Magallan"] Oof, this heater is a little too powerful... burned my hair last time. Oh well, on you go!
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] ...I see.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Yep! Welp, here I go!
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] Let me go in your stead.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Huh?
[name="Magallan"] Simone, you came here looking for someone, right? Our outpost here doesn't hire anybody!
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] I already found her.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Huh.
[name="Magallan"] You mean me, Magallan?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] The environment has deteriorated to the point where our messenger was unable to inform you in advance.
[name="Simone"] Allow me to reintroduce myself. I am a Rhodes Island Operator, codename "Santalla." I am here to retrieve you. Of course, you can keep calling me Simone.
[name="Simone"] Let me go in your stead.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Wow...
[name="Magallan"] Nope. It's too risky!
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] That's what I should be saying to you.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Nope nope nope. I'm the field specialist here. It's my responsibility.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] Don't underestimate me.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Huh.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] Tell me how to do the repair, Operator Magallan. And let me take care of everything outside.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Okay, okay, I got it. Here, take this!
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] What is it?
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] Just press this button and I'll come out and get you! And take this, and this...
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] Heh heh, thank you...
[name="Simone"] I truly found the right person. I don't need them, Magallan.
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=2)]
[name="Magallan"] You do! I can't let you go out there without...
[Character(name="char_341_amona_2#2",name2="char_248_mgllan",focus=1)]
[name="Simone"] No. Operator Magallan... trust me.
[name="Simone"] The land, she trusts me too.
