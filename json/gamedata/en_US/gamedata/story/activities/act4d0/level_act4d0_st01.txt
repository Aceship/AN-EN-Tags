[name="Vanguard Operator"]   Hold up, this... It's Rhodes Island engineering stationary.
[name="Vanguard Operator"]   Who could've left it here? What the hell happened?
[name="Vanguard Operator"]   Woah, that's a lot of big words, and they're all over the place...

[Character]
Operator whose name I do not know, hide yourself well. I had no opportunity to check your nameplate, nor do I remember your name.
Please pardon the hastily scrawled nature of this message, as I am wanting for time. Do me the favor of reading to the end.
First, do not fret. You are safe, for the moment.
However, you must not, under any circumstances, leave these ruins. The probability of the enemy spotting you before nightfall is quite high.
To put it simply, you are at present completely surrounded by the enemy.


[Character(name="char_013_riop")]

[Character(name="char_188_helage_1")]
[name="Hellagur"]   We have both contracted Oripathy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1#2")]
[name="???"]   It truly is you.
[name="???"]   I thought. It was just rumors.

[name="Patriot"]   So. You remember me.
[name="Patriot"]   ...General.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Were it not for you charging so boldly into the fortress with that shield of yours, Barclay, Semyon, and I would surely have died at the hands of Kazimierz's Silverlance, Pegasus Order of Knighthood.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   My warriors. Are brave. Do not fear sacrifice.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Hm. Your manner of speech is quite different now than it was years ago.
[name="Hellagur"]   I once witnessed you rousing the troops with your rhetoric, driving even Barclay the Bald Butcher to cheer your name. No easy feat.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   The infection. Changed my vocal cords. Now. It is difficult. For me to speak. Fluently. Ridiculous.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   ——
[name="Hellagur"]   As is this identity you have constructed.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   Oh?
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   So, the Northern Tundra Guerrillas... that was you leading them. I never would have imagined you could be running around with dozens of Wendigos.
[name="Hellagur"]   That cavalry commander, Alyosha Bluebeard, he made a bet with me that you would become Grand Marshal of the Ursus Army.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   Just staff captain, General. Times have changed.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   …I was jesting. But your loyalty, your record, and the plans you would devise in our staff meetings... You truly were one of the finest officers in all of Ursus.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   You go too far. I am Sarkaz, after all.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   If someone like you couldn't become colonel, the entire Ursus High Command should have been court-martialed.
[name="Hellagur"]   Of course, most of them are long dead.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   Then, I have outlasted them. Your colleagues, are mostly dead.
[name="Patriot"]   And, His Majesty said, the army serves the country. Not their careers.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   He also once said it is not blood that binds the Ursus people together, but conviction. What of that now? I can only hope His Majesty is ready to rest in peace.
[name="Hellagur"]   All our recent Emperors have seen you as nothing more than monsters. You are not Ursus warriors to them. They have done everything they can to oppress your people.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   That one, more enlightened Emperor. Has already passed. This, I understand.
[name="Patriot"]   The war beasts. Of Ursus. Could drown the world, with their numbers. I am not special.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Then it is not because of the Army that you left.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   Correct. I do not care. I want only to stand, shoulder to shoulder. With my warriors.
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1")]
[name="Patriot"]   ......
[name="Patriot"]   General, sit. Drink, with me. I have some. From the north.

[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Life underground is a sort of death. Who I am today has little to do with who I was.

[name="Patriot"]   You hide, here? Less than ideal.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Chernobog has long been uninhabitable. The Catastrophe makes little difference to that effect.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   Seems you must leave.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   The clinic has been extensively looted. We evacuated beforehand, but the loss is still substantial.
[name="Hellagur"]   It was only after I heard the rumors of your presence that I decided to stay here and see for myself.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   I do not deserve, such attention. It is dangerous, here.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   I wanted only to see how one of my few remaining brothers has weathered the years.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   You did not. Those ties broke. Long ago.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Hmph...
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   ...I will find out, who did it. Your clinic. That was, an aberration.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   There is no need. At least, with you here, it is very unlikely that Reunion is responsible.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   I cannot be sure. Reunion, can be, hard to control. There are some, communication barriers.
[name="Patriot"]   Still, General. You could join, Reunion.
[name="Patriot"]   If Ursus was, to be liberated. Then the Infected, and the others, could live. As equals.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   ......
[name="Hellagur"]   Look here. Look around us. Look at this building impaled by Originium.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   I see it.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   This was once a shopping mall. All the people in a three block radius depended on this building for their very survival.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   The Catastrophe. Destroyed Chernobog. Destroyed the fortress, destroyed the city. I do not agree with, the methods. But this was, necessary. We had, no choice.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   It was not long ago that the clocktower was done up in colorful lights. Another dazzling array hung over the intersection below, bathing it in a warm glow.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   The Infected, had no right, to enjoy those lights.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   You want to make the lights glow again, and I simply want to build another market. This is the difference between us.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   ——There was a time. When you would not. Compromise like this.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Perhaps. There may not be such a bright future at Rhodes Island, but I cannot say I feel much for this place either.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   You simply do not, wish to fight your motherland. General.
[name="Patriot"]   Look at this city. Look at the Infected. Look at the mall, ruined by Originium. Look at the dead.
[name="Patriot"]   And you. You have never, been afraid, to get your hands dirty.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   Correct. Should Ursus move violently against us, we will not hesitate to fight back.
[name="Hellagur"]   But Reunion's actions are rather outside my idea of fighting back. Look at this broken city beneath our feet——Reunion is provoking a war.
[name="Hellagur"]   And how many people would die in such a war? How many Ursus lives would a civil war cost?
[name="Hellagur"]   Imagine it. The Ursus devouring itself. Massacring itself. Obliterating itself.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   General.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]   ——
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]   What if, the Ursus, treated the Infected, as Ursus?
[name="Patriot"]   Then, there would be, no war.

[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1")]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]   Excuse me.

[name="Reunion Soldier"]   The leadership has asked for a situation report from each division.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=2)]

[name="Reunion Soldier"]   How am I supposed to answer you, old man?
[name="Reunion Soldier"]   Or were you not really asking? I guess all I can say is we're following the commander.

[name="Reunion Soldier"]   If it's right, he'll do it. If it's wrong, he'll change.

[name="Patriot"]   Should I be? Happy...?
[name="Patriot"]   If the Ursus will it, any city, will be flattened.
[name="Patriot"]   Such an outcome, is most challenging. This battle, it confuses me. The Ursus response.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]

[name="Patriot"]   Perhaps. I have been foolish.
[name="Patriot"]   However, if I do nothing. The chains of the Infected, will grow heavier.

[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="avg_npc_025_1",focus=1)]

[name="Patriot"]   If a conspiracy, of the legislature. We overthrow the legislature.
[name="Patriot"]   If the Army, fabricated resistance. We destroy the army.
[name="Patriot"]   Talulah's goals are broad. Far-reaching. Mine are localized. And specific.
[name="Patriot"]   The past wars of Ursus, were just. Now, the war of the Infected, is just.
[name="Patriot"]   I fight for justice. Justice, forever belongs to Ursus.

[name="Scout"]   Over the past three years, I have suffered many losses, and bid farewell to those like unto my own flesh and blood.
[name="Scout"]   I always believed that as long as one of us lived on, we could someday be reunited. In this spirit I have served Rhodes Island.
[name="Scout"]   But having lost so much, now I see that even a perpetual pessimist like Misery seeks to bring back the Doctor.
[name="Scout"]   He believes with every fiber of his being that we are destined for a future of endless victories, that we shall put death and loss behind us.
[name="Scout"]   I do not share this belief.
[name="Scout"]   It is not that I doubt the Doctor's skill. The Doctor can indeed tip the scales. Without the Doctor, Kazdel would be dust in the wind.
[name="Scout"]   In fact, it was the Doctor who taught me what it means to fight.
[name="Scout"]   And yet... With the Doctor commanding us... looking into the Doctor's eyes, one sees only victory.
[name="Scout"]   Nothing but victory. I see nothing, save victory.
[name="Scout"]   Nothing else in those eyes.
[name="Scout"]   And so I am left thinking: the truth that Kal'tsit is so unwilling to reveal, does it have to do with the Doctor?
[name="Scout"]   In these three years, why must we draw more and more crosses onto the photos of our friends? Why do these sacrifices grow more and more frequent? Why do we fight without understanding the fundamental goals of our organization?
[name="Scout"]   I dare not speculate. I cannot speculate.
[name="Scout"]   If the Doctor must be forged in the crucible of war, then we force this professor to transform from an educator and a researcher into a war machine...
[name="Scout"]   And as such, it would be a truly grave mistake for us to ask Dr. {@nickname} to march into battle.
[name="Scout"]   The Doctor should not command even one more battle. For Rhodes Island's sake, and for the Doctor's own sake.
[name="Scout"]   ...Forgive my naiveté.
[name="Scout"]   I recognize that my ideas are rather juvenile... and have therefore thus far been unwilling to disclose them.
[name="Scout"]   I can only imagine how the others would laugh at me. I do not like being laughed at. And I had planned to carry these thoughts with me to my grave.
[name="Scout"]   But then it came down to this. And I found the hope that someone might join me in taking up this idea...
[name="Scout"]   I want the Doctor to begin anew.
[name="Scout"]   If the Doctor could live without any connection to Rhodes Island, if the Doctor could stand again, having no memory of these preceding events...
[name="Scout"]   If the Doctor could avoid walking once more the path of war, then all would be well.
[name="Scout"]   I bear only this unrealistic hope

[name="Scout"]   I beg you, bear witness to their actions.
[name="Scout"]   Should one ask, you must tell them for me:
[name="Scout"]   While no one will remember the names of my squadmates, they must remember that they died with honor. They did not shrink in the face of death.
[name="Scout"]   Of course, I know many have given their lives in service of the project that is Rhodes Island. No one's death is unique.
