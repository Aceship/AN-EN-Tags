[name="Reunion Caster"]     W, we're in trouble here.
[name="W"]   Ooh... Must be something fun for you to contact me on this channel. What's up?
[name="Reunion Caster"]     Not that much fun, W. While you were sorting out that Sarkaz mercenary, one of our teams deserted.
[name="Reunion Caster"]     They looked like some kind of battlefield mop up logistics team, so we got after them right away.
[name="Reunion Caster"]     They scattered as soon as we made contact, making for the city limits.
[name="W"]   Sounds like somebody earned a cookie.
[name="Reunion Caster"]     There's more... The squad we sent after them fell off the grid too. We haven't been able to make contact.
[name="Reunion Caster"]     I thought maybe you'd know what happened, since you're leading the mercenaries now.
[name="Reunion Caster"]     How does a squad suddenly vanish?

[name="W"]   Am I supposed to understand this?
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]     It is what it is. Other teams report no sign of any enemy ambush or trap. We only know they were facing a Sarkaz.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw")]
[name="W"]   Of course they're Sarkaz. It's not like I've got any other mercs. But anyway, this is a good story. Keep going.
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]     At first contact, we managed to suppress the target. Playing it safe, we held back our squads. The enemy did not appear particularly strong.
[name="Reunion Caster"]     Then, suddenly, all communications ceased.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw")]
[name="W"]   ...Yeah, you guys tip your hand pretty easily. A real predator knows not to bare his fangs too soon.
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]     What should we do?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw")]
[name="W"]   Well what's so special about those Sarkaz?
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]    ...I'm not sure. We lost contact with the eyewitnesses. But from a distance, all we know is they have a close quarters fighter who really likes to get up in there.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw")]
[name="W"]   Then I need you to avoid direct contact with them. Stall that one, I'll be there in a bit.

[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_1002_nsabr_2",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   Nothing. Just a little baby squad that made good bait.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_1002_nsabr_2",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Blademaster"]     Should we move to support them?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw",name2="char_1002_nsabr_2",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   C'mon, everyone's got a job to do. Why can't we just let everybody handle their own thing?
[name="W"]   Yeah... Let's not think too hard about this one. I do care so much about the Sarkaz weirdos my poor predecessor brought along.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw",name2="char_1002_nsabr_2",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Blademaster"]     Understood.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2")]
[name="Reunion Blademaster"]     Inform all squads: prepare for battle, move to the outskirts of the city.

[name="W"]   It's been a while, wandering swordmaster.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#4",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     You——
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   They call me W now.
[name="W"]   How about you?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     Flamebringer. Surely you know what it means to exchange names with me.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   Oooh, spooky. So you traded business cards with all those dudes you sliced up before?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     Commissions and combat are not the same.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   A Sarkaz like you, having been through a battle like that, suddenly up and vanishing, it makes a girl worry.
[name="W"]   And a mercenary running off just because he's got a new leader? That's a little wobbly, isn't it?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     That is utterly insignificant.
[name="Flamebringer"]     Though I never imagined your subordinates would be so unworthy, unfit to even hear my name.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#4",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   Then I guess I should be honored... Oh, but those men weren't under me very long. Ah, are you inviting me to kill you?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#4",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     No, I have no interest in your petty fighting style. It relies so much on outside forces.
[name="Flamebringer"]     But I have to admit, tactics are a kind of skill. Then if your tactics are more elegant than they used to be, I am willing to taste them.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   ...That's weird. Weren't you one of those "as long as the target dies, anything goes" types?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2")]
[name="Reunion Blademaster"]     W, the squad has fallen back to the target location and successfully cut off the enemy retreat. They have nowhere to go.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     And I never expected you would be leading this band of mooks. We've all changed a lot.

[name="W"]   Right. Whatever you say, buddy. Let's set the dragon lady aside for a second, what do you think of running with the mercenary team?
[name="W"]   You're used to the work. You get to do pretty much whatever you want. And the commander you hate is already dead.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     That last bit disproves the first bit.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   Nah. What I'm saying is I might have an idea of how your old mercenary team got wiped out.
[name="W"]   The honored captain of your swordmasters behind the plot that turned you into the man you are today, may very well be in the place you intend to go?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#3",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     Is that right...?
[name="Flamebringer"]     Is it...
[name="Flamebringer"]     Fascinating.
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#5",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="W"]   Ahahaha! So you didn't even know! I mean, I only just found out myself.
[name="W"]   You'll figure it out soon enough. Things aren't as simple as you think.
[name="W"]   I'm really looking forward to seeing what you do. Hehe. What ever will you do?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#5",name2="char_1011_wizard_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Caster"]     W! What are you waiting for?!
[Character(name="char_131_flameb_5")]
[name="Flamebringer"]     ......
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw#1")]
[name="W"]   Okay, listen, my Sarkaz aren't going to do anything? Whatever needs doing, you guys do it yourselves.
[name="W"]   Swordmaster——Er, Flamebringer, you might die in this battle we're about to have.

[name="Flamebringer"]     It's been a long time since I've been in a position like this. I'm excited.
[name="W"]   Long time? Maybe getting your whole team wiped out didn't turn you as icy cold as they say. Looks like you're all cheered up?
[name="Flamebringer"]     That's one way we're different, W. Happiness isn't a goal worth chasing.
[name="Flamebringer"]     I lost so much "last time," but now the path before me is crystal clear.
[name="Flamebringer"]     This time, I hope you won't disappoint me.
[name="W"]   Look at that big smile.
[name="W"]   If I said I'd let you live, would you believe me?
[name="Flamebringer"]     Funny, I was going to ask you the same question.

[name="Dobermann"]     According to the contract, there is no requirement that you engage in open hostilities with Reunion prior to your onboarding.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     At my request.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="Dobermann"]     We welcome Infected and those ambitious enough to pursue solutions to the Oripathy crisis, but we reject those who violate rules and regulations.
[name="Dobermann"]     Considering our lack of information surrounding the specific circumstances of that incident, it has not factored into our decision.
[name="Dobermann"]     But this will not happen again.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     Should anything happen, we can deal with it your way.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="Dobermann"]     We have already dealt with it. Your goals and motivations have also not factored into our decision.
[name="Dobermann"]     If we determine you are inadmissable into Rhodes Island, then no matter how upstanding you may be, we cannot make an exception.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     Right. It's just a personal request.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Hmph. No matter. Welcome aboard.
[name="Dobermann"]     Listen, your actions from here on reflect on the operators beside you, and they will be making decisions based on your actions.
[name="Dobermann"]     As long as you abide by our regulations, Rhodes Island welcomes you as one of our own, regardless of your past.
[name="Dobermann"]     Conversely, Operator Flamebringer, should you step even one pinky toe out of line...
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=2)]
[name="Flamebringer"]     Right.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_131_flameb_5",focus=1)]
[name="Dobermann"]      Now then, let's go to Medical. There's someone who'd like to see you.
