[name="Closure"] Kal'tsit, you think I could see the Doctor for a bit?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Has it been too long since you pranked {@nickname}? Feeling antsy?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Oh come on! I'm really a very caring person.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Last time you called yourself a caring person, you set up a facility to broadcast "Closure's Midnight Video Market" at twelve o'clock for three months straight.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] But...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] We still have no way to turn the volume down.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Okay okay, I admit it! I want to go tease the Doctor.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Not to mention {@nickname}'s memory loss. I can't say for sure if the Doctor even knows who you are.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Huh? Slept too much and turned stupid, huh? That's sad. I'll have to bring the Doctor some snacks as a little cheer-up gift.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Whatever. Just try not to make a bad impression.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Warfarin went bad enough. Add in the Doctor's misconceptions about vampires and the Kazdel matter will have to be postponed. Indefinitely.
[name="Kal'tsit"] This is an opportunity to rehabilitate yourself in the eyes of the people. Seize it well.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Do I really need rehabilitating?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] After the time you set the climate control system to 36 degrees, yes.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] That was a power outage in the machine shop.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] We found your fingerprints on the console.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] It was a power outage in the machine shop!
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] You hacked the surveillance system and deleted the recording, but the console served as a biological backup. I have thirteen tissue samples from thirteen different instances.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] I'm sorry it's my bad that envoy is such an arrogant prick I just want to rub his nose in it sorry.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] ......
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Anyway, the welcome party. Dr. {@nickname}'s welcome back party. We're not throwing one?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Afraid not. Circumstances such as they are.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Hey, why you gotta be like that, Kal'tsit? This is the Doctor we're talking about, the Doctor with amensia. We gotta create an atmosphere of warmth and camaraderie. 
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Did you always look at the Doctor so?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Maybe... I've never been that close to the Doctor. But didn't you just say this is the perfect time to make a good impression?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Closure, let's talk about something else.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Hmph. If you're not going, I'll go myself. I don't care what you do.
[name="Closure"] Did I hear we're going to Lungmen? I think that was on the schedule.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Yes.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] And we can operate freely?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Lungmen has become quite dangerous.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Huh? Really? Lungmen? I thought that place was all about law and order.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] It's the closest city to Chernobog. That should be pretty self-explanatory.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] So why are we going?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Because it's the closest city to Chernobog.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] I think you're hiding something...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] No. I said everything there is to be said in the last meeting. Right about the time you were slumped back in your chair, wearing an eye mask, fast asleep.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] What can I say? Keeping this operation well maintained is tiring work.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] I never said I blamed you. Without you, Rhodes Island wouldn't even get off the ground.
[name="Kal'tsit"] But I still want to do away with your suspicions... What is it you called me in for, exactly?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] What? I can't just call up an old friend?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] I'll be in my lab.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Hey! Wait! Okay... we have a power outage down two corridors in sector three.
[name="Closure"] Can you come look at the cables with me?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Just send an engineer down there. Is it a problem with the power supply cables?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] Or the two of us could go look ourselves.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Whenever I ask you for an inspection, you always delegate it to another operator.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="char_007_closre_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Closure"] My sense of responsibility as Chief Engineer of Rhodes Island has suddenly awakened! Let's go!

[Character(name="char_304_hvrain",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_304_hvrain",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] No thanks necessary. Just doing my job. You don't thank people for that.
[name="Kal'tsit"] You know the way back, Heavyrain?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"] I know.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] Then you show yourself out. Closure and I have something to take care of.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"] But I'm a guard. If I go, will you be okay, Dr. Kal'tsit?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"] You may be mistaken, Heavyrain.
[name="Kal'tsit"] I asked you to come with us just to give you a the layout of the ship. You may not come here often in the future.
[name="Kal'tsit"] I don't need protection.

[name="Kal'tsit"] Before she can establish interpersonal relationships, she needs to find a proper position for herself and integrate into Rhodes Island. That requires both support and tolerance, as well as her own self-awareness.

[name="Closure"] Spanner, please!
[name="Closure"] Thanks, Mon3tr!
[name="Closure"] Hm...
[name="Kal'tsit"] What is it?
[name="Closure"] I can't reach it. Can you give me a boost so I can fix the cable?
[name="Kal'tsit"] Okay.
[name="Closure"] Oof... This whole area has been totally cut off from the power supply. We can start troubleshooting.
[name="Closure"] Kal'tsit, do you think it was a mistake to go to Chernobog and rescue the Doctor?
[name="Kal'tsit"] It was certainly unwise to enter Chernobog at that time.
[name="Closure"] So...
[name="Kal'tsit"] Amiya was very firm in her decision. No one could sway her. And you know how the elite operators are.
[name="Closure"] It only happened because you abstained.
[name="Closure"] I'm starting to think this was some kind of test of Amiya?
[name="Kal'tsit"] Test? No, not a test. Or rather if it was a test, it wasn't me administering it. It was the situation she found herself in.
[name="Kal'tsit"] But as firmly as she believed in that decision, I could only support her... Though I certainly didn't have to make her feel like it would all go smoothly.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Her choice is her choice.
[name="Closure"] Well said. But you're the one who has to deal with the consequences. Aren't you tired...?
[name="Kal'tsit"] Nobody gets it all right from beginning to end, Closure. Not even me.

[name="Closure"] Hey hey hey! Hold me steady! If the three-pin power connector drops, that's the end of both of us.
[name="Closure"] Okay, hold up, I'm laying out the wire.
[name="Kal'tsit"] Did you just stuff two whole sets of wires in behind them?
[name="Closure"] Shhh! I must feel the thrum of the electricity in my own heart, to achieve peace and balance with the current.
[name="Kal'tsit"] I advise you to mull over what you just said.
[name="Closure"] But, Kal'tsit... Oh, should be good. Try the switch.
