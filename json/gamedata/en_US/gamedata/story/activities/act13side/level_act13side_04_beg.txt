[name="Zofia"]  Her very first time entering a knight competition, Viviana Droste earned a title; 'Glimmer' Viviana. Three years later, with her Major debut, she became one of the Grands, taking on the honorific title 'The Candle Knight.'
[name="Zofia"]  In terms of talent, she's the youngest any of the ten Grand Knights have ever been. In terms of strength, hers is still growing to this day. She can't be taken lightly.

[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6")]
[name="Zofia"]  Margaret, are you listening?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Yes. I'm just reminiscing some.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Maria"]  Auntie, is this like how you and Margaret... used to take on the Major?
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1", focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]  Well, if you want to talk then... heheh.
[name="Zofia"]  A certain someone always vanished after a match ended, either holing up in her room studying deep into her next opponent's traits, or secretly running off to train her swordhand with Młynar...
[name="Zofia"]  I still remember us all agreeing to celebrate with a feast the first time Margaret won, and in the end she let it completely slip her mind.
[name="Zofia"]  When we found her, she was dragging her battered body, attempting her own Arts in the garden.
[name="Zofia"]  I did want to ask right then, aren't you freezing?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  It was because my Arts can alleviate pain, too, so...
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  So ultimately it's not proper treatment, or else what value would modern medicine even have?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Heheh... I won't argue with that.
[name="Margaret"]  I know many a doctor that would astonish you. It's thanks to their invaluable techniques that rescuing others is no longer a far-fetched notion.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals? Or was it those two Sarkaz women?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Both. They're all in the fight against suffering.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Maria"]  Come to mention it, Miss Shining and Miss Nightingale went to link up with friends from Rhodes Island, didn't they?
[name="Maria"]  I'm not sure how they're doing right now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  No matter if they're in the Grand Knight Territory, they're still giving all they have to assist the Infected. I believe in them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  But what I myself must do is unrelated to Rhodes Island's will. I can't force this responsibility upon them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Hence why I separated from Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#7", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]

[name="Zofia"]  Alright—anyhow.
[name="Zofia"]  What's the plan of action now? I don't think training would have much meaning to you now, personally speaking.
[name="Zofia"]  But this is your first time in years facing a Grand Knight. Should we have a little exercise, get back to peak condition?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  If you would, Zofia.

[Character(name="avg_npc_061#4", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]  Sit and watch? I didn't ask you to bring your equipment for no reason, did I? Didn't you see what happened last time? Do you want me taking the Radiant Knight alone again?

[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=1)]
[name="Młynar"]  Toland. I've warned you, don't set foot on my carpet whenever you please.
[name="Młynar"]  The Armorless Union's eye is firmly fixed upon you. Are you planning to drag me down alongside?
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  Now that's beyond my wildest dreams. Relax. As long as they don't fold their big slippery kill-men in, how are a bunch of armed lackeys ever gonna track me down?
[name="Toland"]  I'm not winning in a fight, this city's their turf. But if they want to catch me, they'll have to show they want it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1#6", focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  Now that'd be something else. A high knight praising me, some lowlife? I wouldn't carry that weight, would I?
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#3", name2="avg_npc_213_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Młynar"]  I am no longer a knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#3", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  Not even today, with the Radiant Knight getting her title back?
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=1)]
[name="Młynar"]  Shamelessness.
[name="Młynar"]  Why are you here?
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  C'mon, I didn't come to the Grand Knight Territory just for you, Mister Knightsir... but in seriousness, if I could talk you into lending a hand to us, that'd be a fine, fine thing.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=1)]
[name="Młynar"]  I regretfully inform you, this matter is already settled.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  Even though I've given a hundred percent to protecting your little Nearl nieces?

[name="Młynar"]  Even then.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  Alright, fine.
[name="Toland"]  Maybe you really have changed. Młynar. I'm just giving you a heads up...
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  I passed by the border of Kawalerielki today. Those districts were originally a city of their own, right?
[name="Toland"]  You still remember the sight we saw when we came back to the GKT together, back when we were young?
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  Miles of camps outside the city knocked together by the refugees and the poor, bonfires in the evening lighting up the faces of the homeless.
[name="Toland"]  Infected, bandits, farmers, workers, even knight nobility thrown to the beasts. If tragedy was a melting pot, there it melted.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  The sobbing and the anger all mixing together. Even as people to the side are being robbed and killed, they just shuffle their bodies around and try to give themselves a better sleep.

[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=1)]
[name="Młynar"]  I won't need you to help me decide.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  The Armorless Union is cleaning out the Infected's haunt tonight. The coordinates are on this sheet.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=1)]
[name="Młynar"]  And what do the Infected knights... have to do with me?
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", name2="avg_npc_213_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  Oh, Kazimierz is loaded with ways to treat the Infected. Even if they drive them to take each other's lives like gladiators, they still beat Ursus by a long shot.
[name="Toland"]  —But the workers infected in the building of the city, the farmers infected when they couldn't escape Catastrophe, and the survivors struggling so they can become knights?
[name="Toland"]  They'll die like wretches before your eyes. What the Infected will go through will directly impact how public opinion determines the Radiant Knight. And then, in the end, everything you love will be swept into the storm that follows.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2", name2="avg_npc_213_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Młynar"]  You don't need to threaten me.
[name="Młynar"]  What about you, then?
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  I'll help out a bit, 'as I feel it.' If it really comes down to it, I might risk my neck a little.
[name="Toland"]  Pinus Sylvestris is an important potential partner of ours, and I want to pull them in with us. Ha, sure, they're Infected, but they're big fancy knights, just like you, aren't they?
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2", name2="avg_npc_213_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  And that's about that... I'll give you a final touch of advice, Młynar.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2", name2="avg_npc_213_1#5", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_122#8")]
[name="Sona"]  The plan's very simple.
[name="Sona"]  Three years ago, on the day before that Major, the moment the four cities were about to link up, the core city power plant got paralyzed by terrorists.
[name="Sona"]  In order to merge smoothly, each district already had its own engines shut off. When the core city's power dropped out of them in that state, every district was forced to switch over to their independent power systems, which included their cities' engines.
[name="Sona"]  At that point, in order to stop the districts colliding, the Grand Knight Territory was forced to completely scatter apart.
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1#2", name2="avg_npc_122#8", focus=1)]
[name="Justyna"]  The Great Kawalerielki Separation.
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1#2", name2="avg_npc_122#8", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  Yep.
[name="Sona"]  But this time, while the Major's on, we're going to completely cut the lights in all the Grand Knight Territory's arenas.
[Character(name="avg_npc_220")]
[name="An Infected Knight"]  I've heard it multiple times and it still sounds crazy. Can we really pull this off all on our own?
[name="An Infected Knight"]  If the Grand Knight Territory fell this easy, then Ursus would've razed Kazimierz to the ground ages ago.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1#3", name2="avg_npc_122#8", focus=1)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Does this tie in with your... 'Sprawiedliwi friends?'
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1#4", name2="avg_npc_122#8", focus=1)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Strange. The Adeptus allowing the Separation to rear its scandalous head again? What are they calculating?

[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_npc_122#8", focus=1)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  What's the specific plan?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#8")]
[name="Sona"]  Tomorrow evening, Greynuty's taking a team to shock-attack the Grand Knight Territory power plant.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  Ordinarily, it's heavily guarded down there, but on this occasion, the Adeptus are gonna deliberately leave an opening... to give us 'something to exploit.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=1)]
[name="An Infected Knight"]  If the Adeptus are willing to help us so much, why don't they just do this themselves?
[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  Haha, they don't exactly speak in unity. Not just the Adeptus, the law-and-order National Council, the Knights Association, even the General Chamber of Commerce...
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#2")]
[name="Sona"]  We've seen our fair shares of the volatile human condition. Since when would they ever be so simple?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#8")]
[name="Sona"]  Justyna, you go with Ashley.
[name="Sona"]  After you complete your mission, cover them while they withdraw, then rush for the General Chamber building three kilometers out. Szewczyk'll be there to back you up at the designated spot.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#2")]
[name="Sona"]  As for you, Iwona, you're gonna have to handle the Armorless Union.

[Character(name="avg_npc_122#8", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=1)]
[name="Sona"]  The Armorless are already watching this place, so we won't get to pull this off so smooth. You've gotta find some way to proactively get them into a fight, Iwona, draw their attention away.
[name="Sona"]  Of course, if any 'elites' show up, you've gotta hit the brakes, turn tail, and scram.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#8", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=2)]

[name="Iwona"]  Relax. As long as you don't mess up and electrocute yourself, I'll keep with you to the bitter end.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#8")]
[name="Sona"]  Finally... with the help of a few conscientious reporters, we've found a passage to infiltrate the General Chamber of Commerce.
[name="Sona"]  The entrance to the Chamber building's freight elevator is underground. Usually it's only Messengers and porters that go through there—
[Character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  —Of course, even a freight elevator has its cameras. It won't be as easy as that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#8")]
[name="Sona"]  But at the time of the last Great Kawalerielki Separation, with the power out, a Messenger trapped in the elevator escaped by himself, then got caught by a reporter for an interview—
[name="Sona"]  He got into the elevator well through the air vent, climbed up, all the way to the fourth floor meeting rooms.
[name="Sona"]  Our objective's the penthouse computer room. Once we steal the data, I'll find a way to immediately upload it to your terminals, and all of you can get the material—
