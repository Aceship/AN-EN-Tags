[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Does this 'Nightmare Knight' not have a Knightclub affiliation? I thought the Radiant Knight was the only case of an independent qualifying for the Major?
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  And besides, 'Nightmare Knight'... Aren't the Grand Knights' titles usually less of a mouthful? And he doesn't have a 'The' either?
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  He's not one of the Grand Knights, then? So what's so special about him?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#4", name2="avg_npc_223", focus=2)]
[name="A Corporate Employee"]  Ah, this one... haha. He's been a great pain for the Knights Association to handle. I don't entirely know what's up, but...
[name="A Corporate Employee"]  He doesn't care a single bit about knight titles or any such thing, and brushes off all arrangements the General Chamber makes, but he isn't deliberately disobedient either.
[name="A Corporate Employee"]  He's a weird one.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5", name2="avg_npc_223", focus=1)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  A weird one, huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5", name2="avg_npc_223", focus=2)]
[name="A Corporate Employee"]  Yes, sir, but there's no doubt about his strength. And besides, I don't know why, but it seems some knight families are extremely curious about his identity. They've tried asking the Association countless times already.
[name="A Corporate Employee"]  But we're not too clear on what's going on with him either. Things suggest he came from some rural area near Sargon?

[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5", name2="avg_npc_223", focus=2)]
[name="A Corporate Employee"]  Mr. Malkiewicz?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1", name2="avg_npc_223", focus=1)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  ...I understand. You're free to go.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1", name2="avg_npc_223", focus=2)]
[name="A Corporate Employee"]  Yes, sir.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1", name2="avg_npc_223", focus=1)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Oh, one thing, Jewell.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1", name2="avg_npc_223", focus=2)]
[name="A Corporate Employee"]  Hm? What is it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#9", name2="avg_npc_223", focus=1)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  I'm still the same Malkiewicz you know... so no need to be so reserved with me. I'm not used to it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#9", name2="avg_npc_223", focus=2)]
[name="A Corporate Employee"]  Ah... as you wish, I mean, understood, Mal—Mr... Malkiewicz.
