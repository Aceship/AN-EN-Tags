[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Hello, Malkiewicz speaking...
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5", focus=-1)]
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Spokesman Malkiewicz, hope you're having a good day.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  I'm a deputy justice of the National Council. Your suit has reached us, Spokesman.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#3")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Ah...
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#4")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  How do you plan to proceed?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#4", focus=-1)]
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  It is the obligation of a spokesperson to report those knights out of line with the regulations of the General Chamber. As such, we will prioritize our considerations your... complaints against Brassrust Knight.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  However, matters with said Knight Olmer Ingra are somewhat complex.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  You should be aware it was not long ago that Ingra's application for bail was given fresh approval by the National Council; to try him again now could have adverse implications for the National Council's authority.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  We consider, of course... that the spokesperson's demand equates to the Board of Directors' demand. Such as is the only interpretation we can make, we would not refuse you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#8")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Which is why we're having this call. I understand. What are the National Council's conditions?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#8", focus=-1)]
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Oh... conditions? Please, not in those terms. I hope you understand this to be a perfunctory business call.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Mr. Czarny suffered banishment external to proceedings; that was beyond many expectations. Even we do not consider Mr. Czarny's mistake to be so irredeemable.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  But regardless, the past is the past. Czarny has left the Grand Knight Territory and been deprived of his place as a spokesman.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  But because of the abruptness of this banishment, we have not been able to appropriately—handle the aftermath, with regards to all parties.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#8")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  ...You...
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#8", focus=-1)]
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  The Rose Paper Union is a patron of Brassrust. That is Mr. Czarny's personal handiwork.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  He is privy to too much... Mr. Malkiewicz, do you understand?

[name="Zofia"]  Margaret!
[name="Zofia"]  What happened? What was all the talk of you getting carried off by the Candle Knight?!
[name="Zofia"]  What did that woman tell you? Did she threaten you? Was the General Chamber of Commerce—
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#2", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#4$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Calm down, Zofia.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#2", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  We were just dodging reporters, that's all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  Really?
[Character(name="avg_npc_120")]
[name="Old Knight"]  The Candle Knight Droste, eh? Always been an enigma, she has...
[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_101", focus=2)]
[name="Old Craftsman"]  But she's probably in the top three knights of Kazimierz, based on popularity alone. The turnover on her birthday each year'd be enough to build a whole fort.
[Character(name="avg_npc_101", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#4$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  What sort of knight is she?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#4$1", focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  Why are you so like Maria? Listen, you need to pay a little more attention to the rivals around you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  You're here for me, aren't you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#2", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  Sweet-talking me won't get you anywhere.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  She's an astronomical rising star. People even call her 'the second Black Knight.'
[name="Zofia"]  She comes from Leithanien, and has a terrifying talent for Arts, an aristocratic upbringing, fine looks, and meteoric fame for her accomplishments.
[name="Zofia"]  With all that plus her opaque background adding to the scent of mystery around her, practically overnight, the Candle Knight became one of Kazimierz's household names and a Grand Knight.
[name="Zofia"]  The media is still digging into how she leads her private life...
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  But she's by no means just for show.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  She's very young, and very fierce.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  I met plenty of supremely talented Casters during my roaming days. Victorians, Leithanians, and... Infected.
[name="Margaret"]  Even the most outstanding Caster in the world would find it hard to challenge the qualities she exudes. She may not be a soldier, but I won't underestimate her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1", focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  The Black Knight's a very unusual case of Leithanian. She was no good at even the slightest bit of Arts. It's as though she was born to be martial.
[name="Zofia"]  That age has come and gone, but I don't think anyone could forget the sheer impression she left, brandishing her massive armaments about.
[name="Zofia"]  And the Candle Knight, on the flip end of the spectrum, she's practically a 'model' Leithanian knight.
[name="Zofia"]  We don't know what the core of her Arts is, exactly, but the word 'Candle' is absolutely reflective of her equipment's form and her fighting style.
[name="Zofia"]  Margaret... is she your next opponent?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  In two days. It'll be a bitter fight, and we don't have long to prepare... Where's Maria?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  She's at home resting... Are...
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  Are you smiling?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#4$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Hm? Am I?

[name="Spokesman McKee"]  ...I predicted you would refuse, Miss Droste.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  But the General Chamber wants no more of the Radiant Knight winning left and right like this. We must ensure, at least, that she falls to the loser's bracket.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Strange... Wouldn't it have been easier if you didn't give amnesty to the Radiant Knight to begin with?

[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Well... That's...

[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  The Board of Directors is sure to have internal disputes, there's no doubt of that, but if a knight like you were to express such opinions, I worry it'd impact your status.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  My apologies... you must have it just as hard, McKee.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Ah... yes, thank you for your concern...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  In short, I'll be working to mediate for you, even if you aren't willing to use any 'special tricks' against the Radiant Knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  But I'd like for you to understand: though you've refused the Board of Directors's proposal, they will adopt other methods. The situation may, perhaps, evolve towards some extreme...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  The Armorless Union, you mean.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  If possible, I'd like for you to prevent such circumstances from taking hold.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Miss Droste... *sigh* That's far beyond me to promise.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Heh... come to speak of it, is the Board of Directors so untrusting in my power? As a knight, that really does give me mixed feelings.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  No, that's absolutely not the case, I assure you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  The Grand Knights at the forefront of the Major all, without a doubt, have the power to rival the apex knights of any country.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  But opposingly, once you step into this domain, once you near the so-called 'limit,' the gaps shrink in size.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  The uncertain elements will only grow... isn't that so?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Yes?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  I have no intent of putting you in a predicament. I know how the Board of Directors thinks.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  You can go now. I'll look into this... Radiant Knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Good. I'll leave the competition tapes and personal files you need here, then.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  The Radiant Knight seems to have changed vastly since her banishment, I need to warn you of that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Yes... hence why I wanted to meet her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#2", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Margaret Nearl... Margaret Nearl... hm.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Despises the knight tournament industry, granddaughter of a war hero. The Nearl family's pegasus, yet a high-profile champion of the Major too...
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Said to be noble, yet she gives off the air of a campaign knight. Has she seen war and death for herself...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  No, she must have.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#2", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Then has she transcended death before? Has she truly dreamed of casting off the fetters and chains?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Or has she already stridden over a whole new boundary?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Heheh, Margaret. How much she seems like... a true knight.
