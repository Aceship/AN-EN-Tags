[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Yes. The Knights Association has just issued your official title.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Your proposal... a path for the Infected to gain official entry into the tournament, has been great reference material. As we speak, the Board is moving to make it a reality.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  You and your Crimson Chalice Knightclub may well be the pilots for this new program. At the same time, this is also a declaration to all the Infected in Kazimierz that we have not given up on them.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Hopefully, this can keep the Infected problem from boiling over.
[character(name="avg_npc_214_1#2$1")]
[name="The Blood Knight"]  Spokesman, will the Infected still face discrimination, even after becoming knights?
[Character(name="avg_npc_212_1")]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Unfortunately, they will. I can say this with near certainty.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  No matter when or where, people will always dread this disease. If you want them to change their views, you must resort to radical methods.
[character(name="avg_npc_214_1#2$1")]
[name="The Blood Knight"]  If it's just the disease, there's nothing wrong with being afraid of a disease.
[name="The Blood Knight"]  But the Infected are also victims, and Infected knights are still knights.
