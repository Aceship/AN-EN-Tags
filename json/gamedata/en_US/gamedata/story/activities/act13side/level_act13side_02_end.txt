[name="Margaret"]  Now then...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#4$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  You've been through a lot, legend of Kazimierz.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Your banishment has conversely cast much of a veil of mystery on 'The Radiant Knight'... the holy, haloed knight, the awe-inspiring golden pegasus, the hero who returned like a shooting star...
[name="The Candle Knight"]  I saw as I came close today, you were still very young, and disconcerted by such a sudden situation... Margaret Nearl, this is the real, living person.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Come what may, I thank you for helping me just now.
[name="Margaret"]  I assume you're a knight too, though I don't believe I know you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  It's been a while since someone asked me who I was. More than who I am, they care who they wish I was.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#5$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Er, I'm very sorry. I haven't been back in Kazimierz for too long...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#5$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  ...Heheh.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Are you concerned that because you don't recognize me... I may fly into a rage?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  I can tell, you're quite unlike anyone else.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  My, now, thank you for the praise.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  I'm very pleased myself to get to know such a Radiant Knight. My name is Viviana Droste.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Or perhaps, you may also call me The Candle Knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  The Candle Knight... no, Miss Droste, thank you once again for your help today. Were you seeking me for any reason?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Before long, we'll face each other on the field.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  You are an Infected, and one who was once met with banishment. Make no mistake, I have no habit of connecting with my opponents before a match.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  I come from Leithanien; I am an expatriate, living in this bustling city under an identity I could never imagine.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Kazimierz's recognition is already yours, Miss Droste.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  I hear the Radiant Knight never approved of the current system of knighthood, and so, you were consequently banished. Do you still feel the same way?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  The knights of Kazimierz are forgetting their obligation as we speak.
[name="Margaret"]  Have you ever been to the most destitute corners of Kazimierz? Conflict, starvation, infection... the common person suffers enormously, while the knights hide in their cities, making great shows of peace and prosperity.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  The spirit of knighthood is almost completely lost. It's a legacy for capital to wantonly toy with.
[name="Margaret"]  How is it not a form of disgrace?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  ...I see.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  It seems—it is you who stands as a true knight.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  But you are... still no more than a knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  How about your sister? She's been active on the field for the past while.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Has she renounced... the path of knighthood?

[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Miss Droste... and Miss Margaret, good evening.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Good evening, Mr. McKee.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Thank you for tending to the commotion just now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  ...*Sigh*. So you do have that much self-awareness...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  With two Grand Knights such as yourselves, the masses could make each and every move a hot topic. Put the two of you together in front of the media...
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  But never mind all that, there's always some way to sort it out. Miss Droste, you should be preparing for your meeting with the Leithanian noble tomorrow.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  If you would, I'd appreciate you avoid exacerbating uncertain factors for the next while.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Such as, meeting with an Infected knight?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  It seems the noble in question has come for your sake, Miss Droste. You have a celebrity status to the Leithanians too.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Mieszko Industries is very willing to assist them with construction planning in Leithanien, but the one putting the final seal on this trade contract is you, Miss Droste.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Of course... it is my obligation.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  It seems I must apologize, Madam Radiant Knight, that I'm unable to continue my chat with you tonight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  It's alright. You gave me a pleasant surprise... that Kazimierz still has knights such as yourself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  The next we meet will be on the field.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Yes.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  I look forward to the day.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  A final word of advice... Madam Radiant Knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  The storm is nearing.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  The trails will be especially radiant in the starry sky, these coming days of ours.
