[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Ah, Mr. McKee. Do... do you need me for something?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#4", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  It's good to see you again. Have you gotten the letter from the Chamber?
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  The only spokesmen on competition duty for the duration of the Major will be us two... an arduous task, but a gallery of eyes will be trained on us.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  If you want to continue your ascent up the ladder after you drop the 'spokesman' title, this is your greatest chance.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Haha... even if you're joking, I'm not really into the attention. I'd rather go off and handle arena event planning and stuff...
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Is that your particular expertise?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#7", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  It's not exactly expertise or inability or whatever, I'm just...
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#7", name2="avg_npc_212_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  You're being modest again. You've adapted much faster than any of the more senior personnel.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#7", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  —But I have something else I needed to tell you first. I need you to know in advance.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Let's find a lounge to talk in?

[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  I... shouldn't actually be telling you this, but Mr. Czarny left quite hastily.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  On each Major occasion, Kawalerielki picks three of the cities with the most rapidly developing economies to merge into the Grand Knight Territory you see now.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Within the few months following each Major, non-Grand Knight Territory cities aside, the nomadic cities return within their own one-month span to their original routes, following the route engineers' plans.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Each merging of the four cities is glorious. Marvelous flows of people, seamless trade relations, as well as the chance... to deal with a few problems.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  To be honest, if it weren't for how excessively enormous the Kawalerielki Alliance is in scale, how unable it is to effectively move and avoid Catastrophes, and how difficult it is to handle supply distribution and mining...
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  I'd hope to never see the disbanding of the Kawalerielki Alliance.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  But what I'm going to tell you today is about... mm... an unspoken rule.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Regarding...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  ...The Infected.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  This year, Mieszko Industrial Group has provided the Grand Knight Territory seven nomadic platforms, to rival other countries' whole cities in scale... of course, this is how it appears on the surface.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  I heard about this from my colleagues.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  The main thing we should focus on right now is Area 0. It shows up nowhere on the legal listing Mieszko Industries has given.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  It is a unique plate—a small-scale nomadic platform, currently linked at the southwest corner, outside Plate #17.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  That's where...
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Yes. It's right next to the Infected shelter and treatment center.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Do pardon me, Mr. Malkiewicz, but every word we're about to exchange must be on video record.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  This is by regulation. No spokesperson is permitted to act in any way which would betray the General Chamber.

[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  ......
