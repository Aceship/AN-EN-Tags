[name="Roy"]  —What is the Armorless Union?
[name="Roy"]  Long ago, the local farmers and affinities pulled together and hired a group of veteran assassins to stand up to an indulgent knight noble.
[name="Roy"]  But they all failed—Every last one of them.
[name="Roy"]  The knight hanged the traitors atop his castle, to make an example of them. The villagers in the territory could only keep their mouths shut and give up their fight.
[name="Roy"]  Some time after that, however, there was an archer who took matters into his own hands. Back then, everyone figured that bows and arrows were no match for a Kuranta knight's speed, so they weren't really holding their breaths.
[name="Roy"]  Yet when the cruel knight's family awoke the next morning, they found the knight impaled through the ground by a long spear, mid-charge, his head still looking up.
[name="Roy"]  When the crowd got closer, they realized it wasn't a spear at all. It was an arrow. An arrow forged by Darksteel.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="Roy"]  'Darksteel,' the very first member of the Armorless Union.

[name="Roy"]  I'm very well aware that we're hired killers, but nonetheless...

[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1", name2="avg_npc_208_1", focus=1)]
[name="Roy"]  Nothing, it's just... it's been a while since I last saw Darksteel make a move.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1", name2="avg_npc_208_1", focus=2)]
[name="Monique"]  When was it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1", name2="avg_npc_208_1", focus=1)]
[name="Roy"]  You weren't a Lazurite yet... It was when we took care of the last Platinum.
[name="Roy"]  That Platinum was Centaurea's master... or something like that, I guess?
[name="Roy"]  It was raining that day. The time was 4:47 P.M., and I was just about to go on a business trip to another city.
[name="Roy"]  I was the only Lazurite at the time, and I got a call all of a sudden. They told me that 'Platinum' betrayed us, and I had to take him out immediately.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1", name2="avg_npc_208_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Monique"]  So...? Did you kill your coworker with your own two hands?
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1#2", name2="avg_npc_208_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Roy"]  Nope. If I'd done that, I'm not sure I'd ever get a decent night's sleep again.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1", name2="avg_npc_208_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Roy"]  Actually, by the time we made it there... Haha... It was an unfinished building.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1#2", name2="avg_npc_208_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Roy"]  The whole third floor was wrecked, and the traitor... was nailed to the wall high above the ground with one of Darksteel's heavy arrows pierced straight through his chest.
[name="Roy"]  Now, I may be an amateur when it comes to on-site investigation, but I could tell that 'Platinum' tried to run away, only to get shot through the chest by the arrow mid-air, and pinned to the wall like that.
[name="Roy"]  I was standing right under the wall, and the poor guy who fell in love with his target and tried to betray us was nailed right there above me.
[name="Roy"]  I can still see it in my mind. I'd never seen a wall as white as that, and he looked like he really suffered.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1#2", name2="avg_npc_208_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Monique"]  Only an idiot would be fooled by somebody spouting freedom and platitudes. They don't understand what it actually means to survive.

[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1#5",focus=-1)]
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Why didn't you position yourself at the specified coordinates?
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  The Confessarius and the Radiant Knight wouldn't have blocked that arrow.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1#5")]
[name="Roy"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1#5",focus=-1)]
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  You had them face north, and they saw my arrow in time.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  I could've killed the Sarkaz sitting on the chair at least.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1")]
[name="Roy"]  Ahaha, I'm not sure what you're talking about—I can't just laugh this one off, eh?
[name="Roy"]  That was my quick thinking, Boss. The Radiant Knight's a stubborn one. If you kill one of her friends, you'll just end up provoking her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1",focus=-1)]
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  If she'd lose her cool, I don't see why we shouldn't have.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1#5")]
[name="Roy"]  That would've been too dangerous, Boss. Sorry for only cluing you in after the fact, but I think the threat level we're at is just right. Let's not overdo it.
[name="Roy"]  Trust me. The Radiant Knight won't get in your way... By the way, may I ask how things are going right now?
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1#5",focus=-1)]
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  The Board will figure this out soon... but no matter. When the city is paralyzed by the Infected...
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  I will end the last of the insiders, personally.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  And then no one alive will know the identities of the Armorless Union's highest ranking members.
