[name="Ioleta Russell"]  ...'Fear neither hardship nor darkness.'
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  These excellent saplings... must take root and grow in this poisonous land.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  Perhaps we made the wrong decision after all, Nearl...
[character(name="avg_npc_224")]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"]  Grandmaster...
[character(name="avg_npc_210_1#5")]
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  The General Chamber was unable to figure out our objective.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  Naturally... They must've assumed that we came here to topple them, opportunistically, to consolidate the power of the Adeptus.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  And of course, they'd be correct. The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi has taken over the supervision of Area 0, and the General Chamber must be made to pay.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  But the businessmen will never understand... just how far we're willing to go for the sake of that girl, Margaret.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  'Fear neither hardship nor darkness.' That has long been the motto of the Nearl family.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  But these words have also been inscribed on the swords, spears, and shields of the nearly thirty members of the Silverlance Pegasus Knightclub.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  During that war, in the midst of that hopeless battle, mired in that pitch-black swamp, Kirill Nearl vowed to save every last besieged knight.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  They were without supplies, their communications cut off. The combined army's artillery division and tactical unit were searching for them.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  Nearl only convinced seven knights to take part in the rescue operation. Before they set off, each of them engraved those words on their shields: 'Fear neither hardship nor darkness.'
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  Seven knights set out, but forty-one returned.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  But, of the original seven knights, only Kirill and I remained.
[character(name="avg_npc_224")]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"]  But the two of you saved over thirty comrades.
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"]  And also... brought back everyone's shields.
[character(name="avg_npc_210_1#5")]
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  'Fear neither hardship nor darkness.' After that night, all forty-one inscribed those words. On their swords, their armor, their staves, their shields.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  After that, we broke through on the east.
[character(name="avg_npc_224")]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"]  And when you regrouped with the knightclub again, only seven knights were left once more.
[character(name="avg_npc_210_1#5")]
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  Just as heaven willed.
[character(name="avg_npc_224")]
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"]  But three thousand enemies were wiped out, and the shields of those forty-six knights, all bearing the coats of arms of their respective families, were returned to Kazimierz. Not a single one was left behind.
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"]  Daybreak over the Golden Prairie. Every single campaign knight knows this battle well, Grandmaster.
[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"]  We salute you!
[character(name="avg_npc_210_1#4")]
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  The Armorless Union wants to harm the children of the Nearl family?
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  Hah. I wonder if they have enough forces in their reserves.

[character(name="avg_npc_210_1#6")]
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  Very well. Just like I couldn't convince your grandfather back then... Come, come closer, and let me have a look at you.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  Kirill's granddaughter is all grown up now... It's uncanny how much you take after him. He... would've been proud.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  What you seek to do goes against the flow of the times, Margaret.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  You don't need the privilege of the military, of nobility, or of competitive fame.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  This is only your beginning, young lady. Even after all these twists and turns, you've only just begun your tumultuous journey.
[name="Ioleta Russell"]  It's almost dawn.
