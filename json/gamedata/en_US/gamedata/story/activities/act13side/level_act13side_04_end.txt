[name="Candle Knight"]  When a room is illuminated by only a single candle, the candlelight will naturally draw our attention more so than anything else. Yet it is the shadows of everything around that truly engulf us.

[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  It looks like neither of the knights are in a rush to slaughter her opponent for a win. On the contrary, you could say this scene is like an elegant aristocratic social gathering!
[Character(name="avg_npc_121")]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  B-But even so—Did you see those Arts?! The Candle Knight's lightning-quick swordhand! Did it just engulf all that light?!
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Is the Radiant Knight's endless radiance starting to wear thin?!
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Just a small candle-flame—That's right, it's just a tiny candlelight, but check out its surroundings! The flame is engulfed by the darkness around, and it's that unlit darkness, not the candle's light, that's drawing our attention!
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Rather than that tiny glow, you could say the Candle Knight is controlling the shadows underneath that light!
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#3")]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Gotta hand it to them! This isn't something you often see in our matches, not even the finals!
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Their Arts are calm and elegant, but there's no mistake that these Arts are of the highest caliber!
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  That's the Radiant Knight, Margaret Nearl, and the Candle Knight, Viviana Droste, we know and love!

She will stand solemnly in this place till she ceases, perhaps even till the end of times.
Even if no one has walked the path she alone illuminates—
—There is nothing to fear any more.

Malkiewicz looks silently in the direction the Infected knight ran away.
There is a small alleyway, from which he can hear music playing and see waves of heat wafting out of a midnight diner.
The knight's blood trail extends into the distance.
