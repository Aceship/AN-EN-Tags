[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Many organizations in Kazimierz have announced intent to collaborate with Rhodes Island. After arrival at Rhodes Island, their requests are classified into Long-Term Goals and Daily Tasks.
[Tutorial(target="down_back_img",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Each item in Long-Term Goals is unique, and you'll receive corresponding rewards upon their fulfillment.
[Tutorial(target="top_select_img",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Daily Tasks come in many forms. You may select the items you wish to fulfill, and will receive considerable rewards upon their fulfillment.
[Tutorial(focusX=-132, focusY=-53, focusWidth=226, focusHeight=28, anchor="TopRight",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] You can acquire 3 Agenda Proposals per day, and accumulate, at most, erm... let's say fifteen. It'll be hard enough work handling so much; if surplus proposals come in, I'll find some way to handle them for you.
[Tutorial(target="pool_first_daily_slot", searchBtnInChildren=true, waitForSignal="act13side_mission_pool_routed",            animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Try accepting a new Task.
[Tutorial(focusX=191, focusY=0, focusWidth=350, focusHeight=535, anchor="Left",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX=-315, dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] All the Daily Tasks you can accept will be listed on the left side. Accepting a Task will consume a corresponding number of Agenda Proposals. If you find yourself unable to fulfill the Task after accepting, you can choose to turn it down, and all consumed Agenda Proposals will be returned.
[Tutorial(focusX=191, focusY=0, focusWidth=350, focusHeight=535, anchor="Left",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX=-315, dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] But if you choose to turn it down, that Task does not return to the day's list of selections. Please do be aware of that.
[Tutorial(target="btn_search", searchBtnInChildren=true, waitForSignal="act13side_mission_search_routed",            animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX=-315, dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] Each day, when you begin work, I'll sort out your Daily Tasks for you first. If you have any requirements or inclinations, Doctor, we can reconduct our search to update the list.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Before updating the Daily Tasks list, you can choose the organizations you want to contact and the reward materials you'd like to obtain. After you're done, tap the Search Again button, and the list will be updated accordingly.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] While you can reconduct searches, there's still a limit on the number of times. Otherwise, with too-frequent updating, we'd be getting a lot of complaints from these organizations.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Those are the things to be aware of while cooperating with Kazimierz's varied organizations. You may end up very busy with work while we're stopped in Kazimierz; make sure you get enough rest, Doctor!
