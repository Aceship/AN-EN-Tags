The young Nightzmora lets out a long sigh. He looks up to find the familiar night sky has been dispelled by the bright lights of the city.
Is this, too, a symbol of a civilization's advancement? Is Kazimierz conquering the night skies with its bright neon lights?
He finds himself struck with a sense of melancholy.

[name="Margaret"]  Music...? Is there a bar nearby?
[Character(name="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1")]
[name="Margaret"]  It used to be a row of regular old offices here. If I remember correctly, there was a publisher.
[name="Margaret"]  The Grand Knight Territory wasn't this big...
[name="Margaret"]  But, for the past couple decades, every time there was a Major, the Grand Knight Territory would pick out three cities to dock with after a round of competitive bidding.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]  The Kawalerielki Alliance.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#5$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  The city's changing... and even though this is my home, it feels a little... foreign.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#5$1", focus=1)]
[name="Nightingale"]  You haven't been back for very long yet, Nearl.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#5$1", focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]  And you dove straight into the Kazimierz Major right away... you chose to throw yourself into your ideals.
[name="Shining"]  You haven't started living a new, proper life here just yet.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  I will, sooner or later. But now's not the time.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Nightingale"]  You must be tired... I can feel it.
[name="Nightingale"]  Should we take a walk? The night breeze might sweep away some of your exhaustion.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  Sure. Take my hand.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="Nightingale"]  Of course.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]  How tough was the Candle Knight?
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  I was surprised to find a knight like her in Kazimierz these days.
[name="Margaret"]  She's strong, but her hesitation proved to be her weakness. It's too bad we couldn't face each other when she's at her best.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]  Did you enjoy it?
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  I used to despise knight sports. No... even now, I feel nothing but sorrow for the shape Kazimierz is in.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1", name2="avg_1014_nearl2_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  But... haven't we been through a lot together?
[dialog]
[character]
The three friends walk slowly down the street under the Kazimierz night sky.
Far away from the loud markets and hustle and bustle, only traces of the city's warmth can be felt in this alley.
The warmth comes from liquor and song, as well as the aroma of baked goods that yet lingers as pedestrians come and go.
[Character(name="avg_1014_nearl2_1#1$1")]
[name="Margaret"]  This doesn't change what we need to do.

The blue bird takes flight in the gentle night sky.
It dances amongst the glowing neon towers and navigates through a gently flowing river of time.
Taking the Sarkaz's hand, the knight waltzes back and forth under the dim lamplights.
The sight is reminiscent of the noblest statues found in Laterano.
[dialog]
[name="Shining"]  You're beautiful, Liz.
[name="Nightingale"]  R-Really?
