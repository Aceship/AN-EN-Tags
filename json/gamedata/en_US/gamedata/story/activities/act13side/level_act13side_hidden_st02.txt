[name="Sona"]  We knights aren't the only ones affected either. There are still so many ordinary workers, farmers, and civilians with us... and we can't force them to suffer through Oripathy.

[name="Greynuty"]  Those villages on the outskirts of the Grand Knight Territory were established over the last few years in conjunction with the Kawalerielki Alliance. There shouldn't be anyone out there except a bunch of ordinary farmers.

[name="Sona"]  But as 'Sona,' this isn't how I want to leave you all... Still, I'd rather that than force you down a path you never intended to take.

[name="Greynuty"]  I've seen you lost in thought a whole bunch recently, and it's made all of us uneasy. But I hope... I hope you understand one thing.
[name="Greynuty"]  Pinus Sylvestris may be the name of a knightclub, but we all know that even if we're knights, we also aren't really knights.
[name="Greynuty"]  Whether you're coming to us as a knight, as an Infected, as a Zalak, or even as just regular old Sona, you can always talk to us.

[name="Greynuty"]  And, you'll get the same answer every time.
[name="Greynuty"]  We're not splitting up.
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1")]
[name="Justyna"]  To be honest, after everything we've been through, I don't think there are any Infected in the knightclub who strictly identify as knights.
[name="Justyna"]  Of course, those who want to leave and pursue an ordinary lifestyle, we'll help them as well...
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1#8")]
[name="Justyna"]  But that lifestyle isn't for us. Not the four of us.
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1#8", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1#10", focus=2)]
[name="Iwona"]  That's right! If we were as mercenary as those guys, I would've waited all these years for nothing!

[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1#2", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=1)]

[name="Iwona"]  Woah... Great idea!
[Character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  Haha...

[name="Czarny"]  Come in.

[name="Czarny"]  What, are you surprised that my house is so run-down?
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#3", name2="avg_npc_211_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  The thing that surprises me more is how well you seem to have adapted to this life.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_211_1#7", focus=1)]
[name="Czarny"]  Haha... I'm sure that one day, the number of people in high positions solely because of their birth will become fewer and fewer.
[name="Czarny"]  Just look at your tone of voice now, Malkiewicz. You're more qualified for your job than I ever could've imagined. Congratulations.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  I...
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#3", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Czarny"]  Before I found work in the Grand Knight Territory, I was just the son of a winery worker.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#3", name2="avg_npc_211_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  That's quite different from what was on the resume you left in the office.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_211_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Czarny"]  Oh... You even did your homework on me. See, Malkiewicz? I have a good eye for talent.

[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_211_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Czarny"]  You are in peril, and you are powerless within the K.G.C.C., but you still managed to track me down and find my home, even after I completely changed my identity... You found me, Malkiewicz.
[name="Czarny"]  'I can hardly recognize you anymore.'

[name="Czarny"]  If you're going to be uncomfortable, at least try not to show it. It's bad for negotiations.
[name="Czarny"]  I am a branded criminal, and you... Well, the fact that you've come before me today without a completely new face means that you've risen through the ranks since the end of the Major.
[name="Czarny"]  Come, let us toast to your promotion.

[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Mr. Czarny, your exile was unjust.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#2")]
[name="Czarny"]  Oh. You didn't come here just to tell me that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#3")]
[name="Czarny"]  The fact that you know the truth, about how I was treated... means that the people who told you this truth wanted something from you.
[name="Czarny"]  If I was in their position, I surely would've wanted 'Czarny' dead.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#8")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  I'm not doing that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#2")]
[name="Czarny"]  Why?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#2")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  That goes against my principles.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106")]
[name="Czarny"]  Principles, hm? Do you not realize, the person standing before me, speaking so confidently of 'principles' was a pauper who couldn't even put food on the table just a few months ago.
[name="Czarny"]  Face it, Malkiewicz. You've already embraced this society. Sooner or later, you'll join its chosen.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#3")]
[name="Czarny"]  Mmm... Quite a nice aroma to these two cups of wine.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#3")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  But I... don't think you should have to lose your life...
[Character(name="avg_npc_106")]
[name="Czarny"]  Platinum of the Armorless Union was just as naive and innocent as you, which is why I have my life. Of course, I think she only spared me out of convenience.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#3")]
[name="Czarny"]  My family chose not to accompany me to this little village, instead continuing their comfortable lives in the Grand Knight Territory.
[name="Czarny"]  They divided up my assets, the Radiant Knight became the champion, and Czarny became a criminal. The Infected can never break the shackles of public perception–
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#2")]
[name="Czarny"]  ––It proves I never misjudged Kazimierz. It is what it is.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106")]
[name="Czarny"]  Come, Malkiewicz.
[name="Czarny"]  This bottle of brandy was given to me by a former employee who I had promoted. He secretly sent someone to deliver this to me after learning that I was still alive.
[name="Czarny"]  Despite that, though, he still looted my ill-gotten 'bribes.' I had to pretend not to see that the necklace he was wearing came from my collection.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#6")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_106")]
[name="Czarny"]  And this glass... is poisoned. But don't worry, I only just slipped in the drug. As long as you don't drink it, nothing bad will happen.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#3")]
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=30, ystrength=30, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  ––What's the meaning of this?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_106")]
[name="Czarny"]  Help yourself to a glass. I'll take the other one.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#8")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  No! This is ridiculous–– I'll be taking my leave!
[Character(name="avg_npc_106")]
[name="Czarny"]  Of course you can leave, Malkiewicz, but the end result will be the same. Oh, and don't try to throw out the wine either. Wine is very precious, but poison is plentiful.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#8")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Why... Why are you forcing me to do this? I don't understand! We only just met by chance during the Major––
[Character(name="avg_npc_106#2")]
[name="Czarny"]  Why?
[name="Czarny"]  Malkiewicz, have you really not figured it out yet?
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#7")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_106")]
[name="Czarny"]  Cheers, Malkiewicz. To your continued ascendance, and to... my retirement.
[name="Czarny"]  Cheers!
