[name="A Voice on the Broadcast"]  Our champion, having appeared out of nowhere, has put a stop to the battle with a thunderous momentum!
[name="A Voice on the Broadcast"]  Last night's match was cut short when Nightmare Knight's Arts were ruled a violation, and the one who stopped things from getting even further out of hand was the hero, the Blood Knight!
[name="A Voice on the Broadcast"]  The match between the Radiant Knight and Nightmare Knight ended in a tie, and Nightmare will be facing the Blood Knight, whose opponent has dropped out, in his next round—
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#5")]
[name="Greynuty"]  A tie...? Nightmare broke the rules. Shouldn't they have promoted the Radiant Knight to the next round?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#5", name2="avg_npc_122#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  They don't want to let an Infected to just move up the ranks like that, of course.

[Character(name="avg_npc_123#3", name2="avg_npc_122#5", focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_123#3", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  We can tell.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#3", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  He's still alive, real flesh and blood, right?
[name="Sona"]  The city makes us forget it a lot... but we're all alive.
[name="Sona"]  We should have our own choices, our own lives... instead of drifting about in the endlessly beating waves, never to find out who we really are.

[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1#9", focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1#2", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1#9", focus=1)]
[name="Justyna"]  It's... a really awful kind of Arts. As things are, just casting normal Arts is enough to make me ache. I can't imagine how much pain the Blood Knight has to bear, controlling Arts like that.
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1#2", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1#9", focus=2)]
[name="Iwona"]  The Blood Knight... He's strong.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#2", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1#9", focus=1)]
[name="Sona"]  Everybody knows.
[name="Sona"]  It's thanks to the Blood Knight that the Infected won the right to fight in the Major.

[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=2)]
[name="Iwona"]  The Blood Knight. No doubt about it. He's the one who opened up the future for us Infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#3", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  But what we need is an unflagging fight instead of the status quo... so I choose the Radiant Knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  And you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#2", focus=2)]
