[name="Ioleta"]  The ancient race's traditions always believed 'self-reflection' to be the ultimate test. Confidence or arrogance, caution or cowardice; all would come to light.
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_210_1#1", focus=2)]
[name="Ioleta"]  Not all Nightzmora tribes had this tradition though. Only a few examples of similar rituals can be found in historical texts.

[name="Ioleta"]  He stood in the middle of the vast prairies, looking out across the wide land, and made a promise to his tribe and to his brothers and sisters–
[name="Ioleta"]  His Khaganquest would cross the kingdoms of the hippogryphs and the pegasi. He would topple the exalted throne of the Gaulish Emperor, and tear down Leithanien's thousand Spires...
[name="Ioleta"]  In the final ten years of his life, he did indeed complete his Khaganquest as promised. The great Khagan flayed the entire world, burned away the previous epoch, and set his sights on the border of human civilization.
[name="Ioleta"]  Your ancestors accomplished great things. Tola, you are a part of the Khagan genealogy... the last descendant, living right before our eyes.

According to the 7th Expedition Team's intel, two Ursus patrols found an 'army' at the far northern border.
And when they followed the trail of the 'army', they reportedly heard the sounds of war drums and clashing weapons, but could not find traces of any people.
The only thing left behind was an abandoned horn, nothing else.
The Sami individual denied doing anything, and the Columbian observatory only further corroborated this denial. The snowy land was shining peacefully, as far as the eye could see.
There was only a single row of footprints gradually disappearing into the thick snow, extending past the far north, beyond the border of civilization.
