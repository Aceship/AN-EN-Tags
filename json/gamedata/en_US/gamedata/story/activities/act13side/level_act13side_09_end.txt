[name="A Voice on the News"]  The Blood Knight has successfully made his way to the finals, becoming only the second knight in the history of the Kazimierz Major to have a chance of defending his title.
[name="A Voice on the News"]  However, the Blood Knight's status as an Infected continues to draw criticism. A General Chamber of Commerce spokesman came out with this statement: 'The Blood Knight will not be treated differently on the basis of his status as an Infected'––
[name="A Voice on the News"]  Nevertheless, some knight families do not agree with this statement, and in light of the recent power outage and recurrence of the Great Separation, an incredible amount of public pressure has been mounting. Next, we invite a representative of the Knights Association to speak on the matter––

[Character(name="avg_npc_122#5")]

[character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1#3")]
[name="Szewczyk"]  That isn't 'living,' that's called 'surviving'
[name="Szewczyk"]  Anyway, I'm here to say goodbye. The Major isn't over yet, and there are many people moving in and out. It's a good opportunity to quietly slip out of the Grand Knight Territory.

[character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1")]
[name="Szewczyk"]  Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, there's something I have to tell you all.
[name="Szewczyk"]  The fact that the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi has been informed of the Armorless Union and of the Infected containment and treatment facility does not necessarily mean that they'll immediately move to depose the K.G.C.C.––

[name="Old Knight"]  You poor lad. Your folks won't even pay the bills for you when you're in the hospital.
[name="Old Knight"]  But your body is undoubtedly sturdy. Anyone else in your position wouldn't have much life left in them after a bout with the Blood Knight.

[name="Old Knight"]  Even if you're an independent knight, you should've at least had some money saved up from making it to the semifinals. Where'd it all go?

[name="Old Knight"]  Stop moving around. Your wounds are deep.

[name="Old Knight"]  Where are you going?

[name="Old Knight"]  Hey, hold on! Where are you going?
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120#2", focus=1)]
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  ...I'm leaving.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  A golden pegasus, a crimson Minoan. I... I've gained much.
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120#3", focus=2)]
[name="Old Knight"]  You're unhappy?
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120#3", focus=1)]
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  ...No, I failed.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  I won't fear failure anymore.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  I won't be afraid to retreat anymore.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  I won't fear... the beauty of weakness.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  ...But I am still lacking... I have yet to finish my Khaganquest.
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120#3", focus=2)]
[name="Old Knight"]  Khaganquest this, Khaganquest that... Do you even know where you're going?
[name="Old Knight"]  Even in ancient times, it's not like there was a path you were supposed to follow for years, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120#3", focus=1)]
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  North.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  In the distant north... the echoing north where my ancestors disappeared.
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120#2", focus=2)]
[name="Old Knight"]  And after you make your way there, then what?
[name="Old Knight"]  Are you going to come back?

[name="Old Knight"]  You... I assumed you were searching for something you were missing.
[name="Old Knight"]  But it turns out... are you searching for a place to die?
