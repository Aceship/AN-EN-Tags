[name="Roy"]Hm.
Roy's eyes meet with those of the Sarkaz for a moment.
There is only one thing on his mind.
How to strike up a conversation later, without embarrassing himself too much.
[name="Roy"]Haha, I suddenly had a change of heart. Turns out it'll rain later tonight, and I happened to forget my umbrella.
[name="Roy"]But...
[name="Roy"]Should I take this as evidence that the Nearl family intends to shelter the Infected?
[name="Młynar"]Take it however you'd like.

[name="Shining"]Forgive me.

[name="Młynar"]You? You're a Sarkaz...
[name="Młynar"]......
[name="Młynar"]As for the Infected situation, I'll assume you already contacted Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1",name2="avg_npc_108",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]Your assistance is appreciated... The Armorless Union is a powerful enemy.
[name="Shining"]If he insisted on slaughtering every Infected hiding in this area, I fear we would be powerless to stop him.

[name="Shining"]If you want to know what Margaret has been through the last few years, I'm willing to tell you what I know.
[name="Shining"]Of course, if you'd prefer to ask her yourself...
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#2",name2="avg_npc_108",focus=2)]
[name="Młynar"]...I don't care.
[name="Młynar"]I already understand, just from the look in her eyes.
[name="Młynar"]Her mother and father, and even me in the past, all embraced that era of resplendence and glory.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#2",name2="avg_npc_108",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]You... are her true family.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1",name2="avg_npc_108",focus=2)]
[name="Młynar"]You already know everything you need to know. From now on, I won't be lifting even a finger.
[name="Młynar"]You can tell Margaret, and that... 'Rhodes Island.' Tell them beneath the glory-gilded exterior of the Grand Knight Territory... the extent of the rot on the inside.
[name="Młynar"]But a more practical suggestion I have is to leave the Grand Knight Territory as soon as possible. Leave Kazimierz.
[name="Młynar"]Try your best to leave this entire era behind. That's probably one of the few right choices anyone can make.

[name="Shining"]I'm from a pharmaceutical company. This Area 0 that you mentioned... is that the place that shelters the Infected?
[name="Shining"]The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi Kazimierz has funded the establishment of a clinic hub specifically for the examination and treatment of Infected knights...

[character]
Shining is in no hurry to finish her sentence.
In the eyes of the Infected in front of her, she sees doubt, mistrust towards her, fear, and the slightest glimmer of hope.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1",name2="avg_npc_221",focus=2)]
[name="An Infected Knight"]You really aren't from Kazimierz... But that makes sense, they also hate the Sarkaz here. Ugh, sorry, but that's just how things are.
[name="An Infected Knight"]Do you treat the Infected over there?
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1",name2="avg_npc_221",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]Yes.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1",name2="avg_npc_221",focus=2)]
[name="An Infected Knight"]Don't you think it's strange?
[name="An Infected Knight"]Such a big mobile platform has practically become a cage for the Infected knights. Did you know the Infected knights are examined and treated there, but they also 'live' there?
[name="An Infected Knight"]As if existing like that can be called 'living' at all.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1",name2="avg_npc_221",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]......
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1",name2="avg_npc_221",focus=2)]
[name="An Infected Knight"]Alright, it seems you outsiders don't even know this much.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1",name2="avg_npc_221",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]But if all the Infected were to live there...
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1",name2="avg_npc_221",focus=2)]
[name="An Infected Knight"]Then there's not enough space, right?
[name="An Infected Knight"]Those Infected who can still make money will step back into the arena, or carry on... finding whatever odd jobs they can.
[name="An Infected Knight"]For those who can't become knights, they'll be sent to off to do some iffy work... Mining, transporting, all in dangerous environments.
[name="An Infected Knight"]And if you get hurt, and you can't even do that kind of manual labor...
[name="An Infected Knight"]Take a guess, outsider. Where do you think those Infected from Area 0 end up?

[name="Shining"]......!
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1",name2="avg_npc_221",focus=2)]
[name="An Infected Knight"]You may think it's a hospital, and the knights may think it's a prison. But let me tell you, it is neither.
[name="An Infected Knight"]The Infected are shipped there, washed of their dignity, stripped of their basic worth, and finally sent to the cutting boards to be culled.
[name="An Infected Knight"]What you're looking at, Sarkaz, is a glorified slaughterhouse.
