[name="Platinum"]  So... you took advantage of the blackout caused by the Infected... to kill everyone with connections between the Board and the Union.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1", name2="char_204_platnm_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Roy"]  They deserve the credit for making it so easy.
[name="Roy"]  The Board can't stop fighting with itself, under the table or otherwise.
[name="Roy"]  Whoever controls the Union holds an overwhelming advantage–– and no director dared to blatantly manipulate it, or let others do so.
[name="Roy"]  It is precisely because of this tacitly agreed restraint that they ended up losing control of the Union.
[name="Roy"]  Haha, let me tell you a joke. The people of Kazimierz no longer know the name or whereabouts of the person leading the organization they hire for their hitjobs.

[name="Platinum"]  Does Darksteel really exist?
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1#2", name2="char_204_platnm_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Roy"]  Who knows?
[name="Roy"]  Darksteel might be a single person, maybe two. Darksteel might even be a front, or just refer to the signals us Lazurites use during operations.
[name="Roy"]  But for all you know, Darksteel might've passed you on the street, or be sitting in a board meeting, or on vacation in a Sami villa.

[name="Roy"]  Nobody knows. And that's why the name strikes fear.

[name="Sona"]  This is the place?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  Quaint little town, isn't it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=1)]
[name="Sona"]  Do you always come stay out here?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  I used to stay at a more classic den of thieves. Even if I had my eyes on other cities, I did most of my work underground and in the black market.
[name="Toland"]  But then... I met some people. They changed the way I saw things.
[name="Toland"]  I'll skip to the important part though. A bit after that, we fought a battle with the Rusthammers. Know those guys? A bunch of lunatics.
[name="Toland"]  Many people have the wrong idea about the Rusthammers, that they're just a band of thieves. But they aren't. During that battle, I saw kids, teenagers, swinging metal pipes.
[name="Toland"]  Pretty crazy, huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#5", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=1)]
[name="Sona"]  Yeah... Sounds scary.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#5", name2="avg_npc_213_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  That is what makes 'em truly scary.
[name="Toland"]  The Rusthammers weren't born to fight against civilization. They were born of the development of civilization.
[name="Toland"]  Don't expect them to have some end goal in mind, or some greater purpose. It's a mistake to treat them like a group of rational actors––
[name="Toland"]  They're just the orphans of civilization. They were born when it moved on, but couldn't bring everyone along.
[name="Toland"]  Homeless, with nowhere to go, forced to survive in the barren wilderness littered with Originium. They are the Catastrophes.
[name="Toland"]  Thanks to them, we've become united, and as a result, we've also realized a few things...
[name="Toland"]  That we don't want to end up like those lunatics.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_npc_213_1#4", focus=1)]

[name="Sona"]  What kind of people?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  A few Infected.

[name="Sona"]  A real melting pot, huh.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  A few manual laborers, a few bounty hunters.
[name="Toland"]  A few village chiefs unable to make ends meet, a few worn-out nobles.
[name="Toland"]  A few college students, a few illiterates.
[name="Toland"]  A few people trying to change Kazimierz. A few people who were changed by Kazimierz.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#6", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=1)]
[name="Sona"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#6", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  Don't be surprised already. The real surprise has only just begun.
[name="Toland"]  Sona, you've asked me before, what's the point of thwarting the General Chamber. What's the point of the knights.
[name="Toland"]  I'd like to pose the same question back to you. Before the rise of the merchants, before Kazimierz was firmly in the grasp of the General Chamber of Commerce––
[name="Toland"]  ––who was it that exploited the poor and oppressed the masses? Who hanged the Infected, while hiding inside the massive edifices erected by and to their power?
[name="Toland"]  The knights.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=1)]
[name="Sona"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_npc_213_1", focus=2)]
[name="Toland"]  We don't prop up the reality of a villain just beacuse there isn't one now. Why bother though? We always lose out in the end.
[name="Toland"]  But to be honest, though you rarely hear the words 'General Chamber of Commerce' spoken without curses attached... even a broken clock is right twice a day.
[name="Toland"]  The people who've been left behind by the city should unite.
