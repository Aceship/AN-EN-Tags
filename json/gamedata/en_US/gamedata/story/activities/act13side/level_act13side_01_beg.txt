[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Greetings, Madam Droste... What are you reading there?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  A wayside poetry anthology, Mr. McKee.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Ah... you've always been keen on the like.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  I still remember my first time seeing you, stood in that blood-soaked arena with the stench of iron, carrying a book like this too. Your surroundings were every bit out of place with you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  You recall the details quite vividly, it seems...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Ah... haha, ashamed as I am to admit, I'm one of your fans too. If you're not busy, I must have you sign something.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  It would be my greatest honor.

[name="Spokesman McKee"]  *sigh* Truly, a fine wine. It's a coveted Gaulish bottling, and its value would boggle any mind. A worthy tipple for a day such as today...
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  And for a knight such as you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  You flatter me. I've simply been of good fortune.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  This poetry anthology...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Authored by a poet of little name from my hometown. I very much adore the verses he pens.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Ah, a Leithanian anthology... the title means 'Twin Moons and Marigold'?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Your Leithanian is superb as ever.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Haha, it was simply necessary to learn for diplomacy. I'm guessing you like marigolds? We've very few Kazimierzians nowadays who know how to appreciate poetry.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  In the end, the letter can't break free of our mind's eye. These are all but marks for imaginations.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  To the contemporary man, poetry is no more than warrens of words lacking aesthetics, too self-assuming, too pretentious.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Perhaps Kazimierzians are accustomed to a different sort of consumption now, a kind poetry could never match. It's a very typical course of things.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Might you be... insinuating?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#2", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  I'm merely discussing poetry, Mr. McKee.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#2", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Oh... I wonder what.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Ah. Your new glasses suit you very well.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Haha... w-well, it's sharp of you to notice such things. What a surprise, haha...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  *ahem* However, that's not quite relevant to you. No, there's been some prior rumors going around the intercity net and print presses...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Ah... The red wine baths?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Yes, it's been slandering your reputation...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Do people really bathe in red wine? Wouldn't it stick to them so?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Excuse me? I assume... I'm not sure.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  *sigh*... And who would believe such news?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Some would, Madam Droste... many would believe it. Sure as they know it may not be the truth, they'll still let the information color them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Could we not clear the air?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Ah, you always do take non-knightly matters too lightly...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  I've gotten in touch with the Rose Paper Union HQ; it turned out to be some entertainment editor's doing.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  It seems it had already drawn considerable attention by the time it was noticed, and with all the factors at play, no retraction came...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  This is the way they work. I give them no mind.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  You're very forgiving, but that strengthens my feeling you've been wronged.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  You've donated practically all your income to the poor of Leithanien, to build schools back home, to set up nomadic platforms.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  But even if you deny the rumors now, the masses know the taste of delirium already, and they won't care what the truth is.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Hurting and slandering are simple things. They'll grab hold of the rumors and spread the news.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  And how many times have you seen, after the truth came out, those who'd worked against you turned to help you wash away the lies, to make the facts clear?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#2", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Gossip can be fresh and exciting to people, while the truth is an all too boring thing. By all rights, this is how it is.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#2", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  *sigh* How are you so unconcerned?!
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Others should see an example in an upstanding, honorable knight like you! This ought to be better for your reputation, and besides—
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  McKee.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Erk...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  I'm touched.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  You're all too thoughtful a person... and all too tender.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  As a Chamber spokesman, ensuring no external factors are of disturbance to any knight is part of my duty.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  That said, I'd like you to care more, please, about what happens to you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Oh, I have a question for you.
[name="The Candle Knight"]  When will we have the competition schedule?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  *sigh*... How can not even your own matches concern you?
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Provided nothing happens, your next opponent will be Graybeard Knight, followed by... the Radiant Knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Are you that shocked, Madam?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#2", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Of course. The Radiant Knight, Margaret Nearl... I've heard this name many, many times. Such beauty, firmness, and grace too.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#2", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  The Chamber wishes you victory.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#4", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="The Candle Knight"]  Mm... and yet...
[name="The Candle Knight"]  A 'Candle' to the 'Radiant.' What chance do I have of winning?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#4", name2="avg_npc_212_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Don't be like that. Knight titles nowadays are more for catchiness than anything else. They've got nothing to do with true power, Madam Droste.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  You're very strong.

[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_npc_221", focus=1)]
[name="A Weathered Knight"]  The Council don't hide when they're watching, and in the worst case, we just throw some money around. Money's the key to getting the law on your side.
[name="A Weathered Knight"]  But if this keeps up... will the Armorless Union stand by and let it happen?
[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_npc_221", focus=2)]
[name="A Hoarse Knight"]  The Armorless Union? Do they even really exist?
[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_npc_221", focus=1)]
[name="A Weathered Knight"]  Best not doubt them. You'll be wiser for it.
[name="A Weathered Knight"]  Oh, look over there, the ones coming over. They must be the Pinus Sylvestris knights.
[name="A Weathered Knight"]  Huh. They look like a bunch of kids, at a glance.
[name="A Weathered Knight"]  But... maybe some things, only the young can do.

[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_npc_221", focus=1)]
[name="A Weathered Knight"]  Are we going to even make it through alive, if we jump on board with these kids' plans? And if we do, what then? What about next month? Next year?
[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_npc_221", focus=2)]
[name="A Hoarse Knight"]  There's something Infected often say, my friend. It all depends on you.
[name="A Hoarse Knight"]  We've got Oripathy. Plenty choose to resign themselves to that... our lives will be short, and they could end at any moment.
[name="A Hoarse Knight"]  But at the same time, my thinking is that's no guarantee we'll die tomorrow. As long as we've got so many 'tomorrows' lined up in front of us, we should damn well be taking them, fangs out.

[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1", name2="avg_npc_122#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  I know. That's why we need to find an opening, ASAP.

[name="Szewczyk"]  Hmph... Where's a couple of Infected-turned-knights' wealth and privilege going to get you in this city?
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_npc_122#2", focus=1)]
[name="Szewczyk"]  All the money you spend on charity for these Infected, all the meaningless work to conceal them, dragging out their miserable lives in shacks and gutters.
[name="Szewczyk"]  The city itself let you have all of this. You've got nothing close to an opening.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_npc_122#3", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  Ahaha, that's real hurtful to hear, Plastic Knight, sir.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  What about your family, then, Szewczyk? Didn't the knight nobles win all those entrepreneurs over for you, heart and soul?
[name="Greynuty"]  With the General Chamber of Commerce targeting you, you're no different from us. Take a long, hard look at yourself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Szewczyk"]  ...Keh... fair enough, we're all trash smashed down to the dirt here. No real difference at all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1", focus=2)]
[name="Szewczyk"]  Your name was Greynuty? The knight nobility have been doomed since the moment all those years ago when the Affinity was established.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1#6", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1", focus=2)]
[name="Szewczyk"]  Keh. You know what, I'm dying to get out of this place. Heaven knows when you're going to pass that Oripathy around—
[name="Szewczyk"]  But seeing how you're not going to die for the next while, let's focus our attention on other matters—
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_npc_122#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  The Armorless Union.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_npc_122#2", focus=1)]
[name="Szewczyk"]  The Chamber's scumbag lackeys. I'll give them something to regret.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1")]
[name="Szewczyk"]  On that note, you're all so willing to face off with the Armorless... so you must have some ace up your sleeve, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  ...Area 0.
[name="Justyna"]  Or in other words, the Grand Knight Territory's Infected assembly and treatment section. A place for Infected healthcare, formed by an alliance of several companies.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Szewczyk"]  Aren't you Infected knights regulars in those parts? So you tell me. What secrets are the Armorless Union hiding there?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#5", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  —Slow down, Szewczyk.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#6", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  Of course we've got methods... but that doesn't mean we'll tell you about them just like that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#6", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1", focus=2)]
[name="Szewczyk"]  If that's what you really thought, Infected, you would've left me in that wretched hospital and waited for the Armorless to come torture me for answers—you wouldn't have busted me out of there.
[name="Szewczyk"]  Don't you talk at me like this. We're only here now because we all did what we had to. Would your status alone give you the standing to address me, Ashlock?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#6", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Szewczyk"]  Or do you think your busting me out means I should be weeping over you with gratitude?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#6", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  You arrogant noble—
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#3")]
[name="Sona"]  Uh—alright, alright, I'm not against you two fighting it out here and now. Better right this moment than a stab in the back after the Armorless Union shows up, anyway—
[Character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  —We've been doing this for a few years now, for better or worse... we have ins with some government channels.
[name="Sona"]  There's the impoverished and Infected who can't even get by day-to-day, but do you know who else in Kazimierz hates the General Chamber of Commerce?
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=1)]
[name="Szewczyk"]  ...Keh.
[name="Szewczyk"]  Either I've gone mad, or Kazimierz has. You couldn't be telling me a ragtag group of Infected are in deals with the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi to take down the K.G.C.C.?
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  Ahaha...
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_npc_122#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  Look at where you are in life. Look at the knights, Szewczyk.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103nc_1", name2="avg_npc_122#8", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  —They went mad forever ago.
