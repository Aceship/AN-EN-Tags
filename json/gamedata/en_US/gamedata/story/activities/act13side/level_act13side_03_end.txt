[name="Sona"]  Before Szewczyk and Ashley come back, we need to find people who were there... reporters work, heck, eyewitnesses work. The more, the better.

[name="Justyna"]  ...The Great Kawalerielki Separation.
[name="Justyna"]  External reports said it was an industrial accident caused by damage from Leithanian extremists, to shatter the smooth running of the Major.
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  No city comes that weak. More than likely it was everyone dragging each other down.
[name="Sona"]  But what's clear is the whole shake-up showed people just where Kawalerielki... this 'City of Greatness' was rotting through.

[name="Plastic Knight"]  Don't get so full of yourself, Infected. You think the only thing that makes up this city is 'your enemies' and 'your friends?' What a model victim complex...

[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Hilarious. The Armorless wouldn't choose a public venue—especially not a hub of the elite like this to start killing.
[name="Plastic Knight"]  It'd give the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi too much of a hold on them. That's where they draw the line, and we're going to toe that line for all it's worth.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1", focus=2)]

[name="Greynuty"]  The Armorless Union has its informants far beyond where Kawalerielki ends.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  I know that.
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Maybe if I get another chance, I'll cut back on the recklessness. At least until my child grows up, and can take care of himself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_103nc_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  But the K.G.C.C. don't sell remedies for regret. This is where we are, Infected, so we'd better put the complaining to rest.

[name="Sona"]  You had an interview in your report with a pretty unassuming janitor, who said 'I thought there was an earthquake, and I climbed out of the transport pipes, I was so desperate.'
[name="Sona"]  Looking at the picture, this is the General Chamber of Commerce Tower, right? During the Great Separation, the electricals were all out, but the Chamber has a standalone power source.

[name="Old Knight"]  You crossed Kazimierz on foot?!

[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120#2", focus=1)]
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  Batbayar, do you know of the 'Khaganquest?'
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120#3", focus=2)]
[name="Old Knight"]  ...What...
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120#3", focus=1)]
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  It was once... the apotheosis of a Kuranta's glory.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  At the time a warrior comes of age, in order to manifest their glory as a Kuranta, in the company of their mother and father, they would make a promise.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  From the place they were born, they would leave for a distant site of trial. Taking only a weapon gifted by their parents, they would go on foot.
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120", focus=2)]
[name="Old Knight"]  A site of trial...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120", focus=1)]
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  The site of trial is decided by themselves. True courage must be recognized by themselves.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  The way of the courageous spans a thousand folds of the earth, while the cowardly only dared choose the forests before their own door.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  A distance or lack of it was by no means the sole judge. Some brave brought back the heads of prey; some brave cut off their enemies' ears; some brave were empty-handed, but bountiful with pure gold and spices.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  Our forebears never once forgot this tradition. This was proof of valor. Countless Nightzmora soldiers walked the Khaganquest, as the start of their long journey.
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120", focus=2)]
[name="Old Knight"]  So, right now, you're... you're completing your rite of adulthood alone?
[name="Old Knight"]  Where's your parents?
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120", focus=1)]
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  Since I can recall, I had no one at all.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  Batbayar, I'm not ashamed to admit. To be with you, one of the same blood, no matter how distant, consoles me somewhat.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  At least, it lets me take in that, in this age twistedly proceeding, my past brethren... are still alive.
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120", focus=2)]
[name="Old Knight"]  Alright... Are you gonna hang around the Grand Knight Territory like this for the time being, then?
[Character(name="avg_npc_225", name2="avg_npc_120", focus=1)]
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  Kawalerielki... I learned from the travelers, this place is the center of the land of the knights, Kazimierz's glory.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  Yet now I see, it's no more than a rotting fort, trampling the glory, the honor that should shine esteemed.
[name="Nightmare Knight"]  Once, my brethren were trialed in their Khaganquests by beast and Catastrophe. And what I face now, is a forward-roaring, grassland-crushing metal titan.

[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Each knight in Kawalerielki has their own reason to fight.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Maybe many of the ignorant beyond Kazimierz would criticize the modern knight competitions as 'defying tradition,' 'renouncing glory.'
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  But we're not of that mind at all. The times are changing, industry and finance are expanding. Do you honestly still want the people putting stock in the traditions of killing? Rampant duels paid with blood, in modern society?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  No, the General Chamber of Commerce finds it very hard to sanction such things.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  Cities springing up, engines rumbling as they turn.
[name="Candle Knight"]  This is an age of rapid progress. Yes, wildly unlike it was over a decade ago, Mr. McKee.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Madam Droste. The General Chamber expects your certain victory.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  The Infected knight crisis is intensifying. Taken as a locus, the Radiant Knight will extol it, and the Board of Directors will lose great face over it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  I understand.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  I... *sigh* I don't mean to trouble you—I'm guessing you still won't accept our proposals, will you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]

[name="Candle Knight"]  McKee.
[name="Candle Knight"]  I want to decide a victor between me and the Radiant Knight, fair and square.

[name="Spokesman McKee"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  'I won't need to do anything.' These last few years, I've always been solicited as such.
[name="Candle Knight"]  Mr. McKee, as a knight, inaction itself is one brand of action. Can you sympathize with that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  I...
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  Am I not even allowed the satisfaction of a single request anymore? Mr. McKee?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  No... if you really are so determined... I'll try and talk over the Knights Association and the other spokesmen.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  But... can you tell me why? You have no preexisting relationship with the Radiant Knight, as far as we know... What makes you so insistent?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#4", name2="avg_npc_212_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  Why is the General Chamber so focused on her?
[name="Candle Knight"]  Though she's of a famous family, she is no more than a knight once banished, in the end.
[name="Candle Knight"]  Tell me, just what is the K.G.C.C. so focused on?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#4", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  This isn't something you and I should discuss right now, Madam Droste.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#4", name2="avg_npc_212_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  But... alright. Behind this affair, it's a contest between the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi and the General Chamber.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#4", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  In fact, neither the K.G.C.C. nor the Adeptus ultimately care too much who 'takes the championship.'
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Do you understand? I've currently obliged with you... I respect your way of thinking, but your steadfastness is harming the K.G.C.C.'s outlook towards you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  I'll explain to the knightclub myself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  Our Leithanian visitors wouldn't want to see any mishaps befall you in the arena, either.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#4", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  Mishaps? Losing to an Infected champion, you mean?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  I've no illusions of the way they work. The Candle Knight Viviana Droste is celebrated so because she is a Leithanian.
[name="Candle Knight"]  A Leithanian, finding success in the Kazimierz knight competitions, makes them beam.
[name="Candle Knight"]  And since the Black Knight, it's a glory they've taken for granted. I became a substitute for the Black Knight by luck, no more.
[name="Candle Knight"]  No more than vanity.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#6", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  It might be vain of them, yes, but their support for you is authentic. The K.G.C.C. is hoping to sign a trade agreement with the nobles at this moment, and your impact cannot be ignored.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  McKee.
[name="Candle Knight"]  Two knights meet in a contest, hoping to fight a fair battle. Is this something so inherently forbidden?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#5", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  No. You're... you're right.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#1", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  Kazimierz, Leithanien. The home that birthed me.
[name="Candle Knight"]  In childhood I imagined, that the place I lived was one where romance and glory could coexist.
[name="Candle Knight"]  I simply want to... see, with this 'special case,' this Radiant Knight. See who comes out on top.
[name="Candle Knight"]  At least this once, I won't need to consider how to 'win beautifully.' I only need to consider how to claim victory.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#4", name2="avg_npc_212_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  Is that not abideable?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#4", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  The outcome won't change.
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  The K.G.C.C. will find some way to force the Radiant Knight's loss. Losing to you was the most appropriate decision to make.
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=1)]
[name="Candle Knight"]  You support them?
[Character(name="avg_npc_215_1#3", name2="avg_npc_212_1", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman McKee"]  In order to prevent this situation from degrading further... in order not to give the Adeptus more excuses to revolt, yes, I support this decision.
