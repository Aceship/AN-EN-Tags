[name="Jamie"]  We had to fight wild beasts in the underground arenas, sometimes even our fellow men. We still carry the pain and scars that will never go away.
[name="Jamie"]  The bosses wanted more blood and excitement, they wanted us to throw matches, and do their shady bidding outside the arena. We had no choice but to do what they wanted.

[name="Jamie"]  We have Oripathy, an incurable disease. We will die sooner or later, and when we do, we'll lay waste to whatever unfortunate patch of ground we collapse onto.
[name="Jamie"]  We are ominous, we are uncontrollable, and we are different. We are here to be despised.
[name="Jamie"]  Do you think the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi will really allow the Infected to start a proper knightclub?
[name="Jamie"]  Is there really room for the Infected to live in Kazimierz... no... anywhere in this world?
[name="Jamie"]  And even if there were...

Sona has always felt as though she is fighting against something.
Against the Armorless Union, against the General Chamber of Commerce, against all the injustices the Infected face, and against even fate.
She has never actually doubted whether her actions are necessary.
But, right this moment, she feels a chill reaching from her head all the way to her feet, causing her to waver a little.
Indeed, this is the first time she has ever wavered.
It's as though she's just seen a tremendous ice sculpture in the middle of summer.

[name="Sona"]  Hello?
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Flametail Knight... Sona.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  I appreciate your efforts. Excellent work.
[name="Sona"]  Huh...?
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Right now, you have two options.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  'Lazurite' Roy is standing outside the conference room you are in, as we speak.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  This is going to be a very simple transaction. You are holding two storage devices.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Hand over the one on the Armorless Union. You may keep the information on Area 0.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  That will be more than enough for you to bargain the right to a legitimate life from the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  The way I see it, you have no other choice.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Get a grasp of the situation, Flametail Knight. I have nothing against the Infected, much less you.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Be it knights, merchants, or Infected, they are all narrow-minded.
[name="Sona"]  ......
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Don't make an enemy of society, Infected.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  The server has already been destroyed. The chip in your hand is the very last copy.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  The choice is yours.
[name="Sona"]  ............
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Perhaps you are thinking of smashing this telephone right now.
[name="A Voice from the Phone"]  Then do it... if you believe that's the answer to your revolt against fate—

[name="Sona"]  'Lazurite' Roy. You're the only Lazurite assassin who hasn't been replaced in the past dozen-or-so years. There are all kinds of rumors centered around you. Of course we know you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_209_1")]
