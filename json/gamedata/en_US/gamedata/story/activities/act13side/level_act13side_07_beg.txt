[name="'A Silverlance Pegasus'"]  Each of my journeys back to the Grand Knight Territory fill me with sorrow. Our people are losing respect, and our noble ideals have become a tired joke.

[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Everyone who found it unreasonable has been eliminated, creating this thoroughly reasonable history. Fortunately, I've accepted this truth. You understand me, don't you?
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  You're trying to take on Kazimierz... and I suggest you stop.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#2")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  We may have other options, and if you can think of anything, I'll be more than willing to help.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#8")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  But not right now.
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  The prime suspect in last night's blackout is none other than the Infected knights.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Let's suppose the blackout caused a traffic accident... or an elderly person who relies on a ventilator stopped breathing because of it—
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Will we have to turn a blind eye to tragedies like these in the name of helping the Infected?
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Allowing the Infected to participate in the competitions in large numbers has been a source of stress to everyone—
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#2")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  And this stress comes not from some organization or people out there. It comes from society itself, Doctor.

[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#6")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  There are many people dying of unnatural causes right this moment. Disease, Catastrophe. We can't help everyone.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#2")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  I'm sorry.
[Predicate(references="2")]
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  True...
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  If you have an idea... I'm sure you'll get it done.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#6")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  But please remember what I just said. Don't treat this whole affair like you're helping the elderly cross the street.
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  The contradictions that persist in Area 0 are complicated.

[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#7")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Sorry... Perhaps I've gone too far with my words.
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  It'll benefit the both of us if you could calm down and think all this over, carefully.

[name="Gravel"]  ...Doctor.
[name="Gravel"]  Someone here to see you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  I'll get out of your way...
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  And don't get the wrong idea... If possible, I would like to be on your side.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#8")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  That said, it's difficult to find the one best answer out of all the unreasonable things we can do nothing about.
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  You're right... The blackout, the Radiant Knight, and the Blood Knight... It all fueled the Infected knights' will to resist.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#2")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Before everything gets out of hand, I hope both you and I can keep casualties... to a minimum.
[Character(name="avg_npc_211_1#5")]
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  'Goodness pays off,' or so it's often said, but I'm afraid this no longer holds true in our society. Unless, that is, you reach out and grab hold of the payoff yourself.
