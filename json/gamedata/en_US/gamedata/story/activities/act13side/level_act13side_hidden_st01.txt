[name="Młynar"]  You speak of paths, and the future.
[name="Młynar"]  The Nearl knights have never needed others to judge the directions of their paths. I just didn't believe those girls had the power to stay on that path.
[name="Młynar"]  Nor did I believe... in the companions they found.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2")]
[name="Młynar"]  But that was then.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2", focus=-1)]
[name="???"]  Heh...
[name="???"]  You have a point. You and the Radiant Knight are of a kind.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108")]
[name="Młynar"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", focus=-1)]
[name="???"]  The only difference is you're more disillusioned than she is. You believe in the country less than she does. That's all.
[name="???"]  It is a pity. I had thought that our disillusionment and wrath were one and the same.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108")]
[name="Młynar"]  You did everything you could to try to integrate into the General Chamber of Commerce. Don't you dare lump me in with you.
[name="Młynar"]  The time for reminiscing is over.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", focus=-1)]
[name="???"]  What, it's not enough that the Armorless Union will no longer harm Rhodes Island or the Nearl family? Is that not enough to show my sincerity?
[Character(name="avg_npc_108")]
[name="Młynar"]  It is enough.
[name="Młynar"]  Otherwise your corpse would already be outside, collecting the sun and rain.
[Character(name="avg_npc_108", focus=-1)]
[name="???"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2")]
[name="Młynar"]  You know better than me all the things the Union has done.
[name="Młynar"]  We've never seen eye to eye... 'Darksteel.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_108#2", focus=-1)]
[name="???"]  Ahh, as harsh as ever.
[name="???"]  Goodbye, Młynar. I hope that your vacation... will prove fruitful.

[name="Platinum"]  Can't argue with that.
[name="Platinum"]  But don't worry. At least for now, I have to work hard to earn the Doctor's trust. If you don't even know the basics, you'll never make it in the Grand Knight Territory.
