[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Looks like a longer snowstorm is incoming. We'd better get ready to evacuate.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Before that though, let's brush up on some physics knowledge that'll surely come in handy for future operations. I invited Shaw for a special demonstration.

InstructorDobermann, youwantme topushthatMetalCrab intothepit, right? Evenifthecrab isprettylight, I'mnotsure Icancoverthatdistance.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Don't worry. Just wait for the Metal Crab to become <@tu.kw>Frozen</> before pushing it.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] If <@tu.kw>Frozen</> enemies are affected by a shift effect while on an Icy Surface, the strength of the displacement will be <@tu.kw>greatly increased</>. If the terrain allows for it, make use of this knowledge to eliminate difficult enemies in one fell swoop.
