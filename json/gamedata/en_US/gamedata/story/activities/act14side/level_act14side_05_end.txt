[name="Sharp"]How did you know it was me?

[name="Enciodes"]It's not that hard at all.
[name="Enciodes"]I already told you. I'm very familiar with warriors who can break a deadlock.

[name="Arctosz"]Enciodes!
[name="Arctosz"]Are you alright? Where's the assassin?!

[name="Enciodes"]Arctosz, I never expected to see you here. Perhaps this is a portent of the Silverashes and Paleroches finally burying the hatchet?
[Character(name="avg_npc_254_1#7$1")]
[name="Arctosz"]Pfft! I'm here, but that's got nothing to do with you!
[name="Arctosz"]I'm only here to flush out the underhanded lowlife who dared to disrupt Kjeragandr's Grand Ceremony! They will pay for this!
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#7$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]You are truly Kjeragandr's most faithful follower, Arctosz.
[name="Enciodes"]I'm afraid you came too late, though.
[Character(name="avg_npc_254_1#7$1")]
[name="Arctosz"]What do you mean? You would never let an assassin go. Where are you hiding him?
[name="Arctosz"]Wait, this cliff... Don't tell me...!
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]Exactly, Arctosz. My men will look for any traces of her.
[name="Enciodes"]Let's continue our hunt.

[name="Arctosz"]There's blood on the ground. Are you hurt?
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]It's nothing major.
[Character(name="avg_199_yak_1#6$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"]Master, we must treat your wounds immediately!
[name="Matterhorn"]We must... We must at least stop the bleeding!
[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#8$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]We're getting back to the hunt.
[name="Enciodes"]I refuse to ruin Kjeragandr's ceremony.

[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]Send the word out that all is well.
[Character(name="avg_199_yak_1#3$1")]
[name="Matterhorn"]Of course.

Before everyone's eyes, the young head of the Silverash clan takes a step forward.
The snow blows all around him, scattering as he gazes upward. There is not a single scripture that describes such a sight.
The patches of red behind him gradually turn fainter in color, before finally leaving nothing but pure white that blends into the mountainous scenery.
No one can stop him. No one dares to.

Enciodes keeps walking straight ahead.
