[name="Business-Tripping Manager"]Sir, this is just a shoddy plank of wood. What makes it sell for fifty whole pounds?
[character(name="avg_npc_222",name2="avg_npc_278_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Now, sir, you'll want to learn something new today. This is no ordinary piece of wood. It's a blessing of Kjeragandr, Goddess of the Snow Realm.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]It's all thanks to Her protection that Kjerag could be free from the Catastrophes and set down roots here.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]And the stuff that made this charm comes from the evergreen trees of Mount Jungfrau, our own second-highest peak in all of Kjerag.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Do you know much about Jungfrau? Legends say, it's a mountain formed from the tears of Kjeragandr as they fell and froze.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]The trees watered in that snow from on high grow full with Kjeragandr's love and favor for this land, and charms made from that timber assure your safety and warding of calamity where you may go.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Seeing as it's your first time here in Kjerag, why not take some souvenirs for your homefolk back in Victoria?
[character(name="avg_npc_222",name2="avg_npc_278_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Business-Tripping Manager"]What gives you that idea?
[character(name="avg_npc_222",name2="avg_npc_278_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Listen, these last two years, Mr. Enciodes has had more and more of these big corporate whosits flocking in. I heard your accent and I knew straight away.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]To new people like you, see, I recommend these charms in particular to mark the occasion.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Heard of the Tschäggättä, maybe? They're people-eating beasts deep in our mountains. Sinister to the eye, inhuman, there and gone again when you least expect.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]But so long as you're wearing this charm, blessed by the Vine-Bear Court, you'll cower those things under Kjeragandr's might, and they won't harm you.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]And just think, you take it back to your family and tell them, this charm bears the divine protection of Kjerag's Mount Karlan. Paints the complete picture, doesn't it?
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]You've tripped halfway across the land to Kjerag. You wouldn't go back to your own without something nice for it, would you?

[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Well, hahahah, they said Miss Ensia loved climbing ever since she was little. Seems she knows more about the snowcaps than us commoners after all.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]All these wares of mine came from the hunters in the mountains, actually. They must have been the ones swindling me, no doubt.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]I'll be going to find them and settle our score!
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]As for this charm... Miss Ensia, would you mind?
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]

[name="Ensia"]If you want to ward off any rumored Tschäggättäs with it, forget it. But if you take it back as a souvenir, I think it'll work great.

With a steam whistle and a faint announcement, the train departing for Karlan sets slowly into motion.

[name="Ensia"]Doctor, let me tell you about the names of all these peaks.
[name="Ensia"]Look. The one there with the flat-ish slope is Jungfrau. The third Saintess named that one.
[name="Ensia"]The really steep one there, that's Matterhorn. His name actually came straight from that one.

Ensia continues on, with something to say about all the scenery that passes by, and all that Kjerag is.

Aside, Courier wears his eternal smile, listening to every word quietly and respectfully. But from time to time, the faraway look in his eyes carries a hint of something unclear.

Sharp reclines against the seat browsing net pages. He'll find that the contents of Kjerag's internet far exceed his expectations.

Alternately, you listen to Ensia, and cast your gaze out of the window.
Outside, remnants of ice drift in a lake reflecting the blue sky. Some locals are together at its shallows, some drawing water, some doing their laundry, some laughing.
The purest white snowpeaks stand imposingly tall, any attempt to lift your head and see their end blocked by the sunlight.
Halfway up, where the mountains level somewhat, a young shepherd herds flocks of stockbeasts home. No surprise crosses him as he sees the people aboard the train; instead, he lifts his whip, waving at you in greeting.
Not far away is the village where he lives, smoke spiraling from chimneys, peaceful and prosperous.
