[name="Ratatos"]When I first heard that the Edelweiss clan followed Enciodes back to Kjerag, I frankly was not too surprised.
[character(name="avg_npc_253_1#1$1",name2="avg_206_gnosis_1#2$1",focus=1)]

[name="Gnosis"]Needless to say, I never expected you to understand in the first place, Ratatos. You will never be a researcher after all.

[name="Gnosis"]It may be difficult for you to understand how thrilling it is to freely explore the innovation and application of technology, backed by plenty of resources and privilege. To be given a legitimate purpose.

[name="Gnosis"]The number of Infected living in Kjerag will only increase– this is the reality of our world. During the process of Kjerag's continued development, the ability to deal with Oripathy will ultimately become a new bargaining chip.
[character(name="avg_npc_253_1#2$1",name2="avg_206_gnosis_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Gnosis"]He is about to make the people of Kjerag decide between faith and technology, and faith alone will no longer protect them from Oripathy.

[name="Ratatos"]Empty rhetoric. There's no proof.
