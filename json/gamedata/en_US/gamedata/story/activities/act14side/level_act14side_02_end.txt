[name="Weiss"]Today, together with all of you, our guest will bear witness to this message:
[character(name="avg_198_blackd_1#1$1")]
[name="Weiss"]At the Tri-Clan Council, the great houses and the Vine-Bear Court reached an understanding for the interim, and will begin discussion on any follow-up matters.

[name="Weiss"]Because of the grave mistakes made by Gnosis, the previous CTO, Karlan Trade must shut down all of its factories in a show of goodwill.
[character(name="avg_198_blackd_1#1$1")]
[name="Weiss"]Once the transfer of powers is complete, the Silverash family will actively work with the Vine-Bear Court and advocate for a gradual reopening of some of our factories in a controlled, carefully-planned manner.

[character(name="avg_198_blackd_1#1$1")]
[name="Weiss"]Now, as I introduced earlier, and will emphasize once more, this is Sir Enciodes's esteemed guest as well as Karlan Trade's current CTO.
[character(name="avg_198_blackd_1#1$1")]
[name="Weiss"]Our guest is a master not only of the production and mining technologies that we are all familiar with, but also the prevention and treatment of Oripathy.
[character(name="avg_198_blackd_1#1$1")]
[name="Weiss"]The Doctor likewise represents a medical organization that will help Karlan Trade answer the critical questions that we are all struggling with, including the medical support issue we were just discussing.
[character(name="avg_198_blackd_1#1$1")]
[name="Weiss"]Such things would not be possible in our mountains of yore, and, together with the Doctor, Karlan Trade will bring about this new future.
