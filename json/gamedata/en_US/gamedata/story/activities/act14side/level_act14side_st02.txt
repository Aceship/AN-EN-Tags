He activates his Arts, letting a dazzling standard-issue military sabre gently slide down next to his feet. With but a gesture of his hand, the weapon is already in his grasp.

[name="Enciodes"]He bore the burdens of Karlan Trade for so many years, so it's only natural that he would have the ability to exceed my expectations in certain areas.

[name="Enciodes"]I always thought I would have the right to shoulder Kjeragandr's burden only when I was prepared to shoulder all of Kjerag.
[name="Enciodes"]It has been too long since the Tri-Clan Council and the Vine-Bear Court left this burden.

[name="Enciodes"]She may eventually come to make the same choice.
