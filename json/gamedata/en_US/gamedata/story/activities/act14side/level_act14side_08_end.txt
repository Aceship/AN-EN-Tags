Sharp takes a few steps back with a shallow breath.
He has fought many opponents throughout his career, and has also learned from – or at least watched – many formidable fighters at Rhodes Island.
But he has to admit – he has never faced anyone like Degenbrecher before. Or rather, an opponent as pure and simple as Degenbrecher.
She has speed and strength, qualities that every warrior should possess.
Degenbrecher has nothing more, but clearly needs nothing more.
Why would anyone need anything more than incredible speed and strength?
Fortunately... Sharp became an elite operator because he also possesses these two things.

As if reaching a tacit agreement, the two sides take a few steps back.
They both realize that their previous moves achieved nothing toward the goal of eliminating the opponent.
They would have to tap into more of their power.
Degenbrecher casts her sword aside, and pulls the swordbreakers from her waist.
Sharp likewise discards his shield and holds his knife with both hands.
An evergreen tree branch buckles under the weight of the snow with a crackling sound.
In the same instant, Sharp and Degenbrecher both vanish from where they were just a second ago.

Enya suddenly understands why the Doctor sent her sister to her side.
For protection. For a way out. These are the two reasons told to Ensia.
But the Doctor also knows about her ideals, as well as the fact that being able to see her sister would be inherently meaningful.
Have Ensia protect her?
Have Ensia help her escape?
No, quite the opposite.
She is the one who should protect Ensia.
She is the one who should help Ensia escape.
She is the one –– who should be fighting.

Time seems to stand still in this moment.
Only the Saintess's footsteps reverberate through the mountains.
The wind and snow already gave way, at some unknown time.
The dark clouds overhead seem to part before her path, slowly spreading to both sides.
The light filtering through the clouds shines upon the Saintess, and for a second, the people see her descending from the sky itself.
But this is no illusion.
A miracle...
It's a miracle.
It's a miracle!!!
In this moment, only one thought remains in the hearts of the warriors.
And that is –– to offer their staunchest devotion to the Saintess.

All the warriors along the mountain trail lay their weapons down.
