Ratatos takes a sip of her cystymilk, her words carrying a hint of nostalgia.
Those were indeed wonderful times. The Silverashes and the Browntails worked together, side-by-side, while Karlan Trade, representing Kjerag, traded with the outside world.

[Character(name="avg_npc_253_1#1$1")]

[name="Enciodes"]It's my time to wonder, Ratatos.
[name="Enciodes"]What is it that drove you to go this far just to stop me?
[name="Ratatos"]Everyone always says that, just like Old Luca, Ratatos looks cares for nothing but profit. Sure, I am his granddaughter, how could I not?
[name="Ratatos"]I started working with you because I had my eyes on the riches that trade with the outside world could get us. In the end, you and Karlan Trade gobbled up all the profits.
[name="Ratatos"]That's why I was going to crush Karlan Trade through the Great Elder. That way, I could take the lucre for myself.
[name="Ratatos"]That's what everyone thinks. That's been my reputation the past couple years.
[name="Ratatos"]And you think the same way.
[name="Enciodes"]I won't argue that.
[name="Ratatos"]My grandfather always wanted to make the Browntails the greatest clan in Kjerag.
[name="Ratatos"]That's what separates the two of us.
[name="Ratatos"]Right before he died, he summoned me to his deathbed, and loudly mocked Arctosz's old man for being a coward.
[name="Ratatos"]Then, he told me to swallow both your family and the Paleroches whole.
[name="Ratatos"]The way I see it, Arctosz's dad was a more decent human being.
[name="Enciodes"]I agree.
[name="Ratatos"]And I also think that even if the Browntails became the only clan in Kjerag, the people wouldn't call themselves Browntails anyway.
[name="Ratatos"]Kjerag is called Kjerag is because Kjeragandr herself named this place so.
[name="Ratatos"]Because our faith stood in these lands for over a thousand years.
[name="Ratatos"]But, look at us now. It's been several hundred years since the clans started to manage their own lands.
[name="Ratatos"]Before you came back, all the Tri-Clan Council ever discussed was each year's events and which family would foot a bigger portion of the ceremony's bill.
[name="Ratatos"]We stand on the same lands, we speak the same language, eat the same food, and believe in the same Goddess...
[name="Ratatos"]Yet we grew further and further apart because we belonged to different clans, and the truth is that's how we differentiate ourselves.
[name="Ratatos"]Kjeragandr's still in the people's hearts, but the Kjerag name is slowly being forgotten.
[name="Ratatos"]When you came back to Kjerag and told me about your plans to open the borders, I was really happy.
[name="Ratatos"]I was happy because you told me that not only will the Silverashes trade with the other countries, you wanted the other clans to join. I thought that could bring all three families together.

[name="Enciodes"]Karlan Trade trades with the outside world as the Silverash family business. It's naturally a different beast from operating it as Kjerag's window to the outside world.
[name="Enciodes"]And I've actually considered uniting the three clans myself.
[name="Ratatos"]You have? *Cough*.
[name="Ratatos"]I studied up on economics quite a bit to figure out what it is you were doing.
[name="Ratatos"]You lowered the tax rate to lure foreign capital and gave them special treatment.
[name="Ratatos"]To keep the money flowing, you signed all kinds of unequal trade agreements with those big corporations.
[name="Ratatos"]And, you should know, I knew you were building factories to shore up the military. You were never going to be able to hide that from me.
[name="Ratatos"]Do you think I called it quits because I had my eyes on your money?
[name="Ratatos"]I was scared.
[name="Ratatos"]I couldn't see anything that suggested you were going to unite the three cans. All I could see was you trying to turn Kjerag into something of your own. That, or somebody else's.
[name="Ratatos"]If the choice is between you and the Great Elder, I choose the Great Elder every time.
[name="Enciodes"]......
[name="Enciodes"]I have to admit that I have misjudged you, Ratatos.
[name="Enciodes"]If you're opening up to me, I may as well tell you a little about this.
[name="Enciodes"]Kjerag may be rich in minerals and other raw resources, but, crucially, we lack any technology of our own.
[name="Enciodes"]This places us at a disadvantage when it comes to technological trade.
[name="Enciodes"]Some technologies can be bought with money, while others cannot.
[name="Enciodes"]Do you know what that means?
[name="Ratatos"]......
[name="Enciodes"]For example, the rights to operate the Mount Karlan trade route bought us an entire set of last generation railway signals, as well as the right of first offer for soon-to-be-retired railcars.
[name="Enciodes"]Without these, we'd have to rely on what my parents left us with. The old tracks and a railcar fleet over a decade old. They were practically useless for both industrial or civilian transportation.
[name="Enciodes"]As another example, we traded the collaborative mining rights to the eastern mines for Rim Billiton's ore smelting technology and equipment.
[name="Enciodes"]Do you know how much more efficient our processes became thanks to this technology?
[name="Ratatos"]I don't care what you managed to trade, Enciodes. I care about what you gave them.
[name="Enciodes"]We are out of time, Ratatos.
[name="Enciodes"]Be it Victoria, Minos, Columbia, or Kazimierz.
[name="Enciodes"]The only reason they haven't yet laid their fingers on Kjerag is that they don't have to.
[name="Enciodes"]In earlier times, before nomadic cities were invented, when men were sent scrambling across the world by Catastrophes, the different cultures that had been broken up all across the lands knew little about one another.
[name="Enciodes"]Modern nations had yet to be established, and there were no communications or contact between them.
[name="Enciodes"]Then, the age of innovation came two hundred years ago. It was still a time when everyone focused only on their own development, rarely making contact with one another.
[name="Enciodes"]However, fast forward to a few decades ago, the nations in the world gradually began making contact and clashing.
[name="Enciodes"]With Gaul's support, Columbia declared its independence from Victoria.
[name="Enciodes"]However, barely a decade after that, the Battle of the Four Emperors led to Gaul's destruction.
[name="Enciodes"]Columbia and Leithanien's war over Bolívar continues to this day.
[name="Enciodes"]Not only that, but the conflicts between nations sped up their communications with one another. Countries began to enter into trade agreements, establishing trading companies in each other's territories...
[name="Enciodes"]None of them could keep themselves isolated anymore, and they all began to find ways to get along with the other nations.
[name="Enciodes"]And when all of this was happening, Kjerag was completely oblivious.
[Dialog]
[Delay(time=1)]
[name="Enciodes"]And now that the danger is at our doorstep, we're still oblivious.
[name="Enciodes"]Victoria is busy with its own mess. Columbia's pioneering efforts are nearing its western mountain ranges.
[name="Enciodes"]For a long time, Kjerag has been nothing but a barren, impoverished territory not worthy of occupation.
[name="Enciodes"]But if Victoria solves its internal problems, if Columbia has any ideas about Victoria, or even if Kazimierz wants to head south.
[name="Enciodes"]When the time comes, do you think Kjerag will still be able to enjoy peace?

Degenbrecher grins a little and cuts through the wall with ease.
Then, she lightly kicks the wall, sending what appeared to be an indestructible barrier collapsing onto the ground like a child's toy.
The only thing that serves as a testament to its tremendous mass is the loud bang that can be heard when the wall crashes to the floor.
However, Degenbrecher doesn't seem satisfied with the result.

The flames are spreading throughout the room, engulfing everything in their path.
Yet the room's two occupants seem completely unconcerned about what's happening around them.
It is as though they can't feel any of the heat, or perhaps they themselves are burning even hotter than the flames around them.
[name="Enciodes"]I have to admit that I never expected you to feel this way about Kjerag.
[name="Enciodes"]If our conversation had happened sooner, things would not have come to this.
[name="Enciodes"]But it seems this must have been inevitable.

They are all moments to which she can no longer return. She shakes her head. Enciodes, sitting opposite her, has maintained his posture throughout. Be that as it may, she is no longer able to clearly make out his face.
[Blocker(a=0.5, r=0, g=0, b=0, fadetime=0.51, block=false)]
Sure enough, he'll act so calm even at a time like this.

A nobleman from among the crowd ardently removes his coat. He then courteously walks up to Enciodes and puts the coat over his shoulders.
However, Enciodes takes the coat off and walks over to Ratatos, who is sitting on the ground, to put the coat on her instead.
Then, without saying another word, he stands up and heads for his car, parked on the side of the road.
