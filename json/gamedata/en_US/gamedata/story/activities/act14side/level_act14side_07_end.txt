[name="Great Elder"]What people believe in... is not Kjeragandr.
[name="Great Elder"]People can believe in anything, as long as there's a story, a few neat coincidences. They will believe in you, in me, in Enciodes, in the mountain, in the water, even in a single leaf.
[name="Great Elder"]If people can believe in anything, then what is faith?
[name="Great Elder"]The Great Elders finally came to an answer:
[name="Great Elder"]What people believe is faith itself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_258_1#2$1")]
[name="Great Elder"]People choose to vest power in the object of their faith.
[name="Great Elder"]People attribute the things that they shun to their faith.
[name="Great Elder"]People unconditionally trust the way of life to which their faith guides them.
[name="Great Elder"]So, what is faith?
[Character(name="avg_npc_258_1#4$1")]
[name="Great Elder"]Faith is laziness, escapism, and decadence! Faith is stability, faith is stagnation! *cough* *cough* *cough*––
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#3$1")]
[name="Enya"]Let's get you to bed, Great Elder.
[Character(name="avg_npc_258_1#4$1")]
[name="Great Elder"]No, Saintess. Saintess!

The Great Elder desperately clutches at Enya's wrist.
His grasp is so tight that it leaves a red mark on her skin, as if he spent all his remaining strength on it.
His eyes are fixed on the Saintess before him, but he seems to be looking at someone else.

[name="Great Elder"]Faith is ugly! But even so, it is indestructible!
[name="Great Elder"]In the thousands of years of Kjerag's history, the cracks between the three major clans have gradually widened, yet no one can deny faith. Faith is the foundation of Kjerag!
[name="Great Elder"]Faith unites the people of Kjerag. People seek out faith, people rely on faith!
[name="Great Elder"]Kjerag has existed like this for thousands of years!
[name="Great Elder"]The people crave stability! The people crave stagnation!
[name="Great Elder"]Enciodes thinks he has won, but he hasn't. He cannot win.
[name="Great Elder"]How could he possibly defeat the faith that has coalesced in Kjerag for millennia?
[name="Great Elder"]This old man is about to die, but you are still young. You are the Saintess of this Vine-Bear Court, and you will become the Great Elder of this Vine-Bear Court.
[name="Great Elder"]Go forth and instruct him, overcome him. Make him understand that in the face of faith itself, his actions are insignificant, beneath even mention!

Enya remains silent for a while, but forces herself free of the Great Elder's grip.
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=40, ystrength=10, vibrato=30, randomness=20, fadeout=true, block=false)]
She feels pity for the old man before her, but she feels a greater determination.
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1")]
[name="Enya"]...I disagree, Great Elder.
[name="Enya"]You say that faith equals stagnation, and that people depend on faith because they demand stability.
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1")]
[name="Enya"]But that's not how I see things.
[name="Enya"]It is true that once people accept a faith, they come to rely on it. Laziness, escapism, decadence... I can't argue those.
[name="Enya"]But this does not mean that faith itself is stagnation.
[name="Enya"]Faith is just faith, nothing more. It has no attributes by itself, and its substance comes from what is put into it.
[name="Enya"]If the faith progresses, then the faithful will progress with it.
[name="Enya"]If the faith stagnates, then the faithful will stagnate with it.
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#9$1")]
[name="Enya"]The reason why you think the people of Kjerag crave stagnation is precisely because Kjeragandr's faith has been stagnant for thousands of years in the hands of the Vine-Bear Court!
[name="Enya"]We've drawn up this land as a prison to preserve the rules of some ancient agreement, surviving in these snow-capped mountains for millennia without exploring or even making contact with the outside world.
[name="Enya"]And you mean to tell me this agreement has anything to do with our faith?
[name="Enya"]Is it not just the arrogance of the Vine-Bear Court?

[name="Great Elder"]Arrogance? No, no, this is how things were meant to be!
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1")]
[name="Enya"]Nothing is inherently meant to be.
[name="Enya"]If it seems that way, it's only because it's never been changed.
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1")]
[name="Enya"]It's time to change, Great Elder.
[Character(name="avg_npc_258_1#5$1")]
[name="Great Elder"]No, Saintess, you cannot change anything.
[name="Great Elder"]Faith... *cough* *cough*... is the fundamental reason why Kjerag is Kjerag.
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1")]
[name="Enya"]I will go and face Enciodes, but not in the way you want.
[name="Enya"]I don't know if I'll succeed.
[name="Enya"]But, since the Saintess has always been used by the Vine-Bear Court as a tool to guide the peoples' faith...
[name="Enya"]I shall put this tool to good use.
[name="Enya"]I am the Saintess, but I am not the Saintess of the Vine-Bear Court. I am the Saintess of Kjerag.
[name="Enya"]I will use my own methods to guide the people to freedom. The freedom to progress, to explore, to take risks.

Enya stands up and walks to the door of the great hall, her eyes fixed forward.

[Blocker(a=1, r=0, g=0, b=0, fadetime=2, block=true)]
Behind her, the Great Elder occupies his same seat, watching her back grow ever smaller in the distance. He stretches out his hand as to grasp something, but finally, powerlessly, it drops.
He grasps nothing at all.
He remains there evermore, motionless, just like the snow of Kjerag blanketing his dreams.
