[name="Enya"]Thousands of years ago, Kjeragandr descended into this land, naming it Kjerag and bestowing upon it Her eternal vigil.
[name="Enya"]For thousands of years, Her teachings have continued to pervade the lives of all of Kjerag's people.
[name="Enya"]She gave Her flesh to the Paleroche clan, Her hide to the Browntail clan, and Her bones to the Silverash clan.
[name="Enya"]But we all share a common name –– the people of Kjerag.
[name="Enya"]Our belief in Her is the foundation of Kjerag, and is also the reason why we stand here today and call ourselves the children of Kjerag.
[name="Enya"]We all harbor the greatest respect for Her in our hearts, and work together to survive in this land to this day.
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#3$1")]
[name="Enya"]However, as we all know now, Kjerag is not the only country in this world.
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1")]
[name="Enya"]Beyond these snow-capped mountains lies a vast world filled with people who do not look like us, do not speak like us, and do not share our belief in Kjeragandr.
[name="Enya"]In the past, we've had terrible disagreements over how to deal with such people.
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1")]
[name="Enya"]In reality, these disagreements are not an existential crisis. Rather, they are Her way of testing us, Her way of guiding us.
[name="Enya"]She is the object of faith for all the people of Kjerag, our mother and guardian.
[name="Enya"]And as a mother, she never wishes to see her children stagnate.
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#3$1")]
[name="Enya"]Therefore...
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1")]
[name="Enya"]Do not let your desire to preserve the old prevent you from trying the new. You are Her children, and you should be full of courage.
[name="Enya"]Do not let your nostalgia for your homeland prevent you from exploring new places. No matter where you go, She will walk with you.
[name="Enya"]Do not let what you already possess prevent you from seeking greater ventures, for you have the right to more in life.
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1")]
[name="Enya"]After all, She is tolerant. The land She protects should be tolerant, and Her people should also be tolerant.
[name="Enya"]By the authority She has vested in me, I solemnly declare:
[Character(name="avg_174_slbell_1#11$1")]
[name="Enya"]The Vine-Bear Court will tolerate the beliefs of outsiders towards Kjeragandr.
[name="Enya"]Furthermore, the Vine-Bear Court encourages all citizens to pursue a better life in their own ways.

[Character(name="avg_npc_278_1#1$1")]
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]My, if it isn't Lady Ensia. Welcome back to my humble shop.
[Character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
[name="Ensia"]You sure know how to keep up with the times.
[name="Ensia"]When I came back to Kjerag, you were still selling Vine-Bear Court merch. Now you've switched to selling stuff with the Saintess on it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_278_1#1$1")]
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Hahaha, I'm not the only one. Plenty of folks all over the streets. We're even being encouraged to do business now.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Now that you mention it, those things I was hawking before, I didn't actually believe in them.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]But when I make goods for the Saintess, I have real faith in what I'm doing.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]When we first heard about the transfer of power, us businessfolks were real worried about what was going to happen.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]But I never imagined that the Saintess would be so open-minded.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Now, even the most stubborn of folk have nothing to say against dealing with foreigners.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Also, I heard that Sir Enciodes plans to meet with the Saintess for discussions to fully open Browntail and Paleroche territory to the outside world.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]If you ask me, I'm looking forward to seeing this new day more and more.
[Character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#6$1")]
[name="Ensia"]Hehe.
[name="Ensia"]I'm glad to hear you say that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_278_1#1$1")]
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]You certainly ought to be!
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Take a look around you. Of all these people walking the street, who isn't smiling these days?
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Even though all that craziness happened during the ceremony, the Saintess was able to mediate the situation among the three clans.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]And that resulted in something most people could agree with.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Y'know, I have to thank the Saintess and Sir Enciodes for all this.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Oh right, were you planning on leaving Kjerag in that getup of yours?
[Character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]

A painting hanging on the wall catches Ensia's attention.
It's of her sister Enya and her brother Enciodes, standing at a negotiating table and shaking hands, seemingly reaching some sort of agreement.
For a moment, she pauses.
[Character(name="avg_npc_278_1#1$1")]
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Ah, this painting depicts Sir Enciodes and the Saintess reaching an agreement on Kjerag's future.
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]Though I don't know if this scene actually happened, there's no doubt that those two are the ones governing Kjerag now...
[name="Kjerag Merchant"]And everyone knows they're siblings.
