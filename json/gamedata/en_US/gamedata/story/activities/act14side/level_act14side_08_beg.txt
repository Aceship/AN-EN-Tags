Though she was physically fit, she'd always give up halfway through.
Her favorite thing to do was to curl up on the sofa by the fire, knitting something for herself or her brother, or just napping.
'My sister probably doesn't like the mountains.' That's what Ensia thought.
But in the end, after becoming the Saintess, she was bound atop the mountain.
Ensia always had a dream – that one day, she would save her sister from the mountain.

It was hard to send letters back to Kjerag from Rhodes Island.
Usually, she would only get the opportunity when Courier showed up.

Each time he visited, she always felt conflicted.
Fortunately, Courier would bring a letter from her sister.
Unfortunately, Courier and Matterhorn would always treat her like a kid, as if she couldn't see the sadness on their faces.
She is also a child of the Silverash family. She read the books left behind by her parents and knew of the vision they had for Kjerag. She also got good grades in Hypatia's class!
