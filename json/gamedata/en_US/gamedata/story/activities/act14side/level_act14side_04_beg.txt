[name="Kjerag Commoner B"]Impossible. Tomorrow is the day of the Holy Hunt. The Master is surely preparing his offerings to the Saintess, so why would he be patrolling his territory so early in the morning?

[name="Kjerag Commoner A"]I heard it used to be forbidden to ride burdenbeasts to Mount Karlan.
[name="Kjerag Commoner A"]Especially those seeking an audience with the Saintess. They had to keep their palms together, eyes on the ground, head bowed in prayer from the moment they left home.

[name="Kjerag Commoner B"]What kind of fool do you take me for? That's not what I meant!
[name="Kjerag Commoner B"]I'm just worried about the Master. You know as well as I do that the other two clans are insatiable. The Master proposed to return the Saintess to power, and they weren't too happy about that.
[name="Kjerag Commoner B"]They are jealous of all the progress that the Master has brought, and even sabotaged one of our railways. I heard they're in bed together now, working to keep Kjerag sealed.
[character(name="avg_npc_280_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_277_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Kjerag Commoner A"]They wouldn't dare. Resorting to violence right before Kjeragandr's eyes would anger Her.

[name="Kjerag Commoner B"]Is there anything they wouldn't do?

[name="Great Elder"]It's good that he's willing to show piety at a time like this.
[name="Great Elder"]Silverash also ordered a number of idols from the Vine-Bear Court not long ago, and enshrined them in places that lacked them.

[name="Elder A"]Saintess, whether or not his devotion is true is for Her to judge. It is not our place.
[name="Elder A"]But, even those ignorant of Kjeragandr will be converted and pray to her after seeing a majestic aurora.
[name="Elder A"]Looking at things this way, to become devout overnight is actually a manifestation of Her power.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#1$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus=1)]

[name="Great Elder"]Enciodes aside, the other two clan leaders will head up the mountain and wait.
[name="Great Elder"]Since you will be accepting the transfer of power from the three clans, your speech will need to be more than just satisfactory.
[name="Great Elder"]Whether during the Holy Hunt or the ceremony itself, if you seem to display any sort of bias towards the three clans, people will immediately interpret that as a sign that a clan has gained or lost power.

[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#6$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Great Elder"]Enya, you are familiar with the records of the previous Saintesses, and should know that the Saintess is not required to personally join the hunt. Were you planning to use this longbow at the ceremony initiating the Holy Hunt?
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#6$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Enya"]Although the Saintess is not required to personally join the hunt, it should not be an affront to Kjeragandr if she does so.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#6$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Great Elder"]This has been the tradition in the Vine-Bear Court for thousands of years. You must not disregard your status, Saintess.
[name="Great Elder"]The Saintess must accept the offerings of the three clans on behalf of Kjeragandr, bestowing food upon Kjeragandr's children in Her place during the ceremony.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#6$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Great Elder"]What would it mean if the Saintess hunted the prey with her own hands?
[name="Great Elder"]Besides, this isn't some kind of safari for your amusement.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#6$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Enya"]You're right. In thousands of years, there has never been a precedent for the three clans to cede power to the Vine-Bear Court.
[name="Enya"]The transfer of power was originally meant to be a peacekeeping measure, but these days, turmoil wells up beneath Mount Karlan, and the land meant to be handed to the Saintess is being senselessly torn apart.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#6$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Enya"]As if they are not afraid to blaspheme Kjeragandr.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#1$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Great Elder"]Kjeragandr's children need the Saintess to appease Her anger and show Her that the pious hearts of the people of Kjerag have not changed for thousands of years.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#1$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Enya"]Maybe what Kjeragandr needs is a Saintess who will convey her wrath.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#3$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Great Elder"]Don't invite ill omens within the temple.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#3$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Enya"]And in addition, 'those who toil will hold power, and those who idle will suffer.'
[name="Enya"]Though the three clans are supposedly ceding their power to the Saintess, it is not for the sake of handing over any true authority.
[name="Enya"]But in order to maintain the faith's standing, I cannot simply wait for the bounties of the three clans. I am not trying to portray them as incompetent, but rather leading by example.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#6$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Great Elder"]If maintaining the faith's standing is what you care about, then it is impossible to speak of change.
[character(name="avg_npc_258_1#6$1",name2="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Enya"]Kjeragandr's children have already moved forward. The prayers they offer to Her are certainly different from what they were a thousand years ago.
[name="Enya"]And surely, She is not responding to them the same way She did a thousand years ago.
