The frost-like moonlight shines down on the paulownia table in the middle of the hall. Sitting at it are a husband and wife. The wife rubs her hands as though she has something to say, while her husband props his head up with his hands, attempting to catch a nap.
She swallows her saliva and begins to speak hesitantly.

......
The wife waits for a long time and hears nothing. Only a barely audible noise can be heard from the kitchen.
She holds her breath and stands up to listen more closely. All she can hear is the sound:
Da-da-da.
The wife's expression changes immediately and her pupils dilate. Cold sweat drips from her forehead, and just as she is about to run to her neighbor for help, her husband speaks.
[name="Husband"]Come here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_141")]

The wife picks up a candle and inches towards the kitchen before nudging open the slightly-open door. Inside is pitch black; barely anything is visible.
She holds up the candle to find her husband leaning against the wall. She breathes a sigh of relief.

A bolt of lightning strikes outside the window, briefly lighting up the entire room.
That's when she realizes that her husband isn't leaning against the wall. Rather, his entire body has fused into the wall, with only his pale face still visible.
At the same time, a familiar noise can be heard once more.
Da-da-da.
At last, she cannot contain herself anymore and starts screaming.

[name="Xiaohei"]Uhh...
[name="Xiaohei"]Why did you decide to keep it? Does it just... happen to suit to your fancy?
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]Why else?
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#8$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=1)]
[name="Xiaohei"]So if you didn't like it, you'd have listened to the other guy? Would you have killed it?
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#8$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]If I did, what would you do?
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=1)]
[name="Xiaohei"]I'd have stopped you.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]Then good.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#8$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=1)]
[name="Xiaohei"]...What do you mean?
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#8$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]If my decision wasn't gonna affect yours, what's the problem?
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=1)]
[name="Xiaohei"]But—
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]If you've made up your mind, stop yammering and follow through with it. You better think it through first, though. Else you might regret it your whole life.

[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#10$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]You know it?
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#10$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=1)]
[name="Xiaohei"]Yeah, Mr. Lee told me about the slums before. It's where the people with the Stone Disease live.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#10$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]What else did he tell you?
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=1)]
[name="Xiaohei"]That I should stay away.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]He's right. This ain't a place for brats like you to be hanging out in.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=1)]
[name="Xiaohei"]Then why'd you bring me here...?
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1", name2="char_105_emper", focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]Because ain't nobody wants to come here, which makes it a perfect hideout for anyone who doesn't wanna be found.

[name="Xiaohei"]Mr. Emperor, who's this?
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]A doctor. He's got mad skills. Knows how to treat both people and animals.
[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]Haha, I can deal with just about anyone or anything. As long as they're not scared to visit me, that is.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#4$1")]
[name="Xiaohei"]If he's so amazing, why hide here?
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]Eh, because I'm a criminal.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#8$1")]
[name="Xiaohei"]How could a doctor be a criminal?
[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]Because a doctor will always force you to face your pains in the most direct and cruelest way possible. They bring nothing but bad news.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1")]
[name="Xiaohei"]That just makes you honest, not a criminal.
[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]Haha, the most honest people are also the cruellest.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#8$1")]
[name="Xiaohei"]So what are you getting at?
[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]Very good. Stay suspicious. Don't take everything at face value.
[name="Doc"]It's the things you're most sure of that will always betray you in the end.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#8$1")]

[Character(name="char_105_emper")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]Forget I said all that. Oww...
[name="Doc"]Here, sweetie, let me take a look... It doesn't look so bad. It's pretty thin, and its fur lacks luster, so it's just malnourished. Looks kind of out of it, though. Did something happen?
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]Is it sick?
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1")]
[name="Xiaohei"]Maybe it's scared? It was in the storm cloudbeast's mouth not too long ago.

[name="Doc"]Good boy, let me take a look. Ah, I knew it. I stitched this leg wound up myself. It's neat, elegant, and just perfect.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1")]
[name="Xiaohei"]Do you remember its master?
[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]Hm, they brought this little fella to me three years ago. If memory serves, they had Oripathy. By the looks of it, they were on their last legs.
[name="Doc"]I felt sorry, so I patched the cloudbeast up for free, but then they asked me to keep the little guy too.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#10$1")]
[name="Xiaohei"]And you didn't.
[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]Of course not. I'm a doctor, not a philanthropist.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]Not 'cause your broke ass couldn't afford it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]See? What did I just say? The most honest people are also the most cruel.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#1$1")]
[name="Xiaohei"]Uh... I guess?
[name="Xiaohei"]So... Do you know where that person is now?
[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]They was very sick, so probably dead by now? There's an empty lot on the outskirts of the slums, where people sometimes put up whatever an Infected's left behind, to remember them by. You could try checking there.
[name="Doc"]Come to think of it, I still remember them turning out their pockets to find every last bit of change, just so I would adopt it. Poor thing.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#4$1")]
[name="Xiaohei"]You still remember after so long?
[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]Well... I have a good memory. It's strange, isn't it? I even remember how much they managed to scrape together.
[Character(name="avg_lolxh_4067_1#4$1")]
[name="Xiaohei"]How much?
[Character(name="avg_npc_331_1#1$1")]
[name="Doc"]Sixty-seven. Sixty-seven LMD exact.
