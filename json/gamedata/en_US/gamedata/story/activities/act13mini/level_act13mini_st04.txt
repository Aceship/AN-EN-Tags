Xiaobai remembers the park she went to yesterday. Candles and flowers placed on clean, neat grass. All sorts of people attended the funeral, solemn-faced and sorrowful.
But this place couldn't be more different.
The weathered photos, the rusted barbed wire, the strident screeches, and choking smell in the air all told her—
When the Infected pass, the only thing they can take with them is life itself.
