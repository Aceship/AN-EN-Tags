Instructor Dobermann! The brand spread to me! I can sort of hear this slip-slippy noise...

Take care. Nethersea brand will deal Arts damage and Nervous Impairment to any Operators deployed on its tiles.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_snakek")] —C-Can I retreat, please... It feels like my shoes are gonna melt, and I can't stand up—
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] —Deploying Operators on nethersea brand is the only way to prevent its further spread. Any tiles without Operators deployed will allow the brand to freely spread!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] I'll send a Medic Operator to back you up. Hang in there, Cuora!
