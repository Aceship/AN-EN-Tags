The fluorescing nethersea brand has devoured the golden Iberian hall.
The intricate dome reflects a ghastly blue light. And amidst the glow stands a lone, out-of-place woman.

She turns her head. Her eyes hold nothing but compassion and expectation.

Before Irene can fire her handcannon, the Seaborn lurches forward.
As the wall cracks audibly, Skadi leaps back with tremendous force, before closing the gap between her and the Seaborn almost instantly.

The Seaborn's murmurs can be heard from afar. Gladiia frowns slightly.
For an ordinary land-walker to recklessly make contact with the ocean and win eternal madness is certainly conceivable.
But what of the other Seaborn that obeyed him?
But Gladiia does not think about it too deeply. Because a nauseating premonition is gnawing at her nerves—
—It makes her neck itch.

[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
