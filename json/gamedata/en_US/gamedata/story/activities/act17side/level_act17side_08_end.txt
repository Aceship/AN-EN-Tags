Still attempting to spit out vestiges of human speech, the chief mate is punctured by the Seaborn's fangs.

Irene. You know where this is.
Yes! It's the Inquisition's—
Underground. Where every High Inquisitor has seen the truth.
The truth...
Consider this one thing, Irene. What is the Inquisition fighting for?
For Iberia's purity and virtue, for the sanctity of our Laws and Scriptures.
But what if the concept of truth as seen by the people is only superficial? What if the Law has no reach, the Scriptures fail to prophesize, and the morality that governs all things amounts to naught? How will you pass down judgment then?
I... will judge based on my own standards.
Even if it means casting aside the distinction between good and evil that you've always adhered to?
Of course!
That is easier said than done, Irene. There's no point trying to teach from my example, and I'm not as partial towards words as you are.
Maestro...
But.

Irene raises her handcannon.
A second cavity suddenly appears in the Seaborn's adamantine body, as a torrential flow of heat melts through its sturdy, unusual walls.
The surging temperature turns the surroundings into a sea of fire. The chief mate sobs and retreats to the side, staring blankly at the scene before its eyes.
The Seaborn has never been enveloped by such Arts before. It feels a sense of being overwhelmed, but quickly adapts.
However, the Inquisitor's barrage will not cease until the flames of her lantern sputter out.
[name="Irene"]Release the chief mate, you monster. And get a good whiff of the scent of Originium.
[name="Irene"]You have not sinned in any way. The Holy Scriptures do not even mention your existence.
[name="Irene"]Right now it is only I, as an Iberian, who is handing down this verdict.
[name="Irene"]The scourge of the seas must be wiped out. You have no right to live.
[name="Irene"]In the name of Iberia.
