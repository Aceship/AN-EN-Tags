Gladiia looks all around her.
She knows that someone once considered a friend is watching her closely.
But she does not hesitate, nor does she have the luxury to hesitate. She must retrieve the secrets of this ship as quickly as possible, and... return them to Ægir.
She wishes to return to her home. She wishes to offer it her aid, to avert calamity.
She looks at the key in her hands.
She swings open the door to the treasury.

[name="Gladiia"]What situation?
[name="Ulpianus"]......
[name="Ulpianus"]I... Like you, I have spent some time on land.
[name="Ulpianus"]But what I saw was different. Did you come to understand the civilizations on land? No, you don't need to answer that, Gladiia the ever-arrogant.
[name="Ulpianus"]For their civilizations to survive, they tapped into Originium. It brought them opportunity and hope, but it also unprecedented calamity. To this day, they still have not fully analyzed its principles.
[name="Ulpianus"]I've witnessed many tragedies... They've given them the name 'Catastrophes.' They are foolish, ignorant, and weak, but the way they struggle and die is still harrowing.
[name="Ulpianus"]And the Ægir... are no different.
[name="Gladiia"]You were never this sentimental in the past.
[name="Ulpianus"]No, sentiment has nothing to do with this.
[name="Ulpianus"]What I'm saying is, Ægir provoked the ocean in order to survive, and the ocean devoured it in return. Then, ocean gave birth to us.
[name="Ulpianus"]We are products of a grotesque struggle. If we are unable to resolve this problem at its root, then we are unable to resolve it at all.
[name="Gladiia"]...What did you see, Ulpianus? What did you see to make you abandon the bonds of blood and the camaraderie we shared in battle?
[name="Ulpianus"]'Sanctuary.' No doubt that is what those filthy cultists would've called it.
[name="Gladiia"]Your familiarity with them only reduces my trust in you.
[name="Ulpianus"]But the word is an apt description.
[name="Ulpianus"]You know what Ægir once found in the depths of the ocean. Even if aren't a historian, a general education should've covered at least this.
[name="Ulpianus"]Thousands of years ago, we reached the heart of the ocean. There, we found the point of origin. The cradle of civilization.
[name="Gladiia"]......
[name="Ulpianus"]As far as I know, Gladiia...
[name="Ulpianus"]He, and those Seaborn, in the deepest recesses of their nest...
[name="Ulpianus"]I saw it. A 'construct.' No, not even the greatest science consuls of Ægir would have been able to make sense of what I saw.
[name="Ulpianus"]I was unable to go deeper, as my injuries were too severe. My blood boiled, my ears rang, but still I felt—
[name="Gladiia"]...What?
[name="Ulpianus"]—The plurality of Him.
[name="Gladiia"]......
[name="Gladiia"].........
[name="Gladiia"]Well... That doesn't even slightly explain why you abandoned the team. You should have brought this information back.
[name="Ulpianus"]When millions of cries returned to a single point, the unhatched Seaborn all murmured the same name from within their differently-shaped sacs.
[name="Ulpianus"]...Ishar-mla.
[name="Ulpianus"]Or rather, Skadi.

[name="Ulpianus"]Ishar-mla.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]When I sank into the trench along with the titan's corpse, enduring a pressure that no ordinary Ægir could bear, I saw something I'd never seen before.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Gladiia, you know why Ægir distances itself from the land. You know the many theorems as to why Originium and Catastrophes cannot invade us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Most of them have been proven correct. The ocean is like a petri dish, nourishing and protecting the purity of Ægir.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]But... what if the civilization we're so proud of is nothing more than mold growing on the back of some giant?
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]You were always exceptionally inquisitive, a quality that allowed you to make contributions in various fields, sowing the seeds for great breakthroughs. But to slander Ægir? You've changed so much I hardly recognize you.
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]Plus, you should know the boundaries of what is appropriate. Your speculation about Skadi... You levy the cruelest of accusations against your fellow Hunter.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]'Seaborn' is just a broad, catch-all name. As you know, their morphology is significantly more complex.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]You've been concerned that Skadi might become an even higher form of them, have you not?
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1")]
[name="Gladiia"]First and foremost, I'm concerned that you've chosen the wrong path.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]The 1st Company and the 4th Company perished along the way, one after the other, to create an opportunity for us to break through.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]And you, the 2nd Company, stayed near the nest's entrance. It seems wrong to even describe it as a 'nest.' We'd entered a vast, singular entity, where we nothing more than tiny germs.
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1")]
[name="Gladiia"]But germs are more than capable of killing a healthy person.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]And we were successful, or so we led ourselves to believe.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]I simply fell into a deep sleep, along with His corpse. Blood, if that luminous substance can even be called that, had drenched my whole body and enveloped me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]But I simply slumbered with His corpse for a long, long time. I hid in the crevasses of His empty shell, leaning against the remnants of His flesh, until all sounds around me fell silent.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]But what about Skadi? It was she who dealt the final blow.
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]That was not a normal 'killing.' Nor was it a 'hunt.' It was 'feeding,' a feeding of their kind.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Your conjecture is both correct and faulty. Did you assume that all Hunters will eventually lose control and become Seaborn? No, not Skadi.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]You already understand. Those who've witnessed Him, those of us who sank into the trench and floated back up, all understand.
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]You mean to say that...
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]If anything goes wrong, we must kill her.
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1")]
[name="Gladiia"]She's YOUR Hunter.
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1")]
[name="Gladiia"]You still haven't offered an explanation for your deliberate cover-up and betrayal. And you would have me trust your speculation like this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]......
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1")]
[name="Gladiia"]I'm not keen on your habit of staying silent. Maybe I'll have to take away your mobility and drag you back to Ægir.
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1")]
[name="Gladiia"]A pity that one of our consuls might finally fall in battle. Could harm morale.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Let's see you try.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Gladiia. How can you still claim to represent Ægir when you are so distraught about your own transformation?
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]This is an opportunity. I don't expect your assistance, or even understanding, but some of us cannot afford to pass up this opportunity.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Only by uncovering the truth do we have a chance at survival.
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#2")]
[name="Gladiia"]And how is that related to what you're doing?
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]You came for the ship. I came for Breogan.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]I've already made a breakthrough. Breogan's evidence corroborates what I've seen. Truly an amazing man. To think he arrived at these same conclusions, in that era, under those conditions.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Those by your side— You already understand that only they are truly valuable. None of the land-dwellers will ever understand. And thus, he died in solitude.
[Character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1")]
[name="Gladiia"]I wouldn't say that nobody understands, but...
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]'But.' For someone as strong and resolute as yourself, how many times have you said 'but'?
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]We are colleagues. Together, we were the architects of this war. We should trust in each other more.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]A final word of advice—don't return to Ægir. It is too soon, too dangerous. Too many things we haven't straightened out. Going back now is wasted effort, and you do not know what has become of it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Remain on land. Should something happen, of course—she IS my Hunter.
[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]I will shoulder the responsibility.

But when she turns her head, a tremendous cracking sound spreads through every corner of the room. A violent shuddering follows, and the truth filling the table is scattered across the ground, seeming to sear her vision.
'Leviathan.'
Before the chief designers of warfare proposed the Abyssal Hunter plan, before the Abyssal Hunters delved into their nest, Breogan chose a title that the foolish land-dwellers are obsessed with to this day.
He wanted to thoroughly elucidate the nature of calamities. He found the last piece of the puzzle on land.

[Character(name="avg_npc_445_1#1$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Day in and day out, he searches for the terrible waves and seeks to quash them. An endless, futile pursuit.
