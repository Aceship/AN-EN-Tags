[name="Thiago"]Aye. Your parents, or more accurately your grandparents, came from a place called Ægir, a great country deep beneath the ocean.
[name="Thiago"]That's where you were from, lad.
[name="Jordi"]Ægir.
[name="Thiago"]Years ago, the dream we had for Gran Faro wasn't the lifeless town you see today. It would have been a fortress, one that laughs at any siege.
[name="Thiago"]We would have built defenses on the coast around it, protected our country from calamity, heralded her revival, and rebuilt our home. All with our own hands.

Jordi does not interrupt. Thiago grows increasingly excited, a light returning to his dull and cloudy eyes.
Every hair on his body stands on end. He changes his posture. The sea breeze brushes against his brow, and he even looks grander somehow.

[name="Jordi"]The lighthouse?
[name="Thiago"]A relic of the Golden Age, spared from destruction by the Profound Silence.
[name="Thiago"]Not even calamity could break us. We marched ever forward, our hearts filled with hope.
[name="Thiago"]Marin wore that blue hat of hers. She said we'd become heroes, that our names would live on.
[name="Thiago"]Your grandparents, your parents... two generations of Gran Faro gave everything they had for this blueprint. Their greatness should have been immortalized forever.
[name="Jordi"]But...
[name="Thiago"]But now there's nothing left.
[name="Thiago"]You see that ship? There used to be many ships at the port. The Penal Battalion should have taken it, but they've forgotten all about it.
[name="Thiago"]All that's left is some junk, a town out in the middle of nowhere, more troubles than I can count, people stuck in a dead end, and—
[name="Jordi"]And that ship.
[name="Thiago"]Yes. That ship.
[name="Jordi"]My parents, and the grandparents I've never met... were they proud of their duty?
[name="Thiago"]This isn't the first time you've asked that.
[name="Thiago"]You asked it when you first learned to talk, and when you started working at the chapel. You asked it many times, pointing at the dust-covered notebooks and schematics at home.
[name="Jordi"]I... I remember.
[name="Thiago"]Yes, lad.
[name="Thiago"]No matter how many times you ask, my answer is always 'yes.' No matter the outcome, they never lost hope after that great disaster, and gave their all to the cause.
[name="Thiago"]Your parents even volunteered for our final attempt to reach the Eye.
[name="Thiago"]Don't blame them for abandoning you. They were carrying what was left of all our dreams. So many years had come and gone. We HAD to succeed.
[name="Jordi"]......
[name="Thiago"]The last we saw of them was when their fleet set sail from right here.
[name="Thiago"]They were heroes. Marin said we would all become heroes, but now none of us are, except for the dead.
[name="Jordi"]I see...
[name="Jordi"]So my father and mother...
[name="Thiago"]But you know what laid waste to it all? In the midst of despair, we managed to muster the hope to relight the lighthouse. And what came of it?
[name="Thiago"]The Inquisition. They arrested the Ægir. They said there were Church of the Deep spies among us.
[name="Thiago"]We were fighting for Iberia, but the Inquisition took everything from us—our pride, our dignity, our dreams... everything.
[name="Thiago"]Do you understand now?
[name="Thiago"]Leave this hopeless town, leave Iberia and go as far as you can. Go to another country, go to a better place.
