[name="Jordi"]Huh? Wha–? Me? Join the Inquisition?
[Character(name="avg_npc_447_1#1$1")]
[name="Saint Carmen"]Strictly speaking, I won't give you a chance to refuse. Gran Faro needs more hands than ever, and you will play a pivotal role as an Ægir.
[Character(name="avg_npc_447_1#9$1")]
[name="Saint Carmen"]After that, hrmm. Maybe I could use a young secretary?

[Character(name="avg_4009_irene_1#7$1")]

[Character(name="avg_4009_irene_1#7$1")]
[name="Irene"]But don't you want to see it? The future that Iberia once promised to Gran Faro, and to Thiago?

[name="Jordi"]......!
[Character(name="avg_4009_irene_1#7$1")]
[name="Irene"]Joining the Inquisition will be a test. As an Ægir, you wouldn't be wrong to treat it as a trial by fire. Or as practice for enduring hardship.
[Character(name="avg_4009_irene_1#7$1")]
[name="Irene"]Don't get the wrong idea.
[Character(name="avg_4042_lumen_1#7$1")]

[Character(name="avg_4009_irene_1#1$1")]
[name="Irene"]My status as an Inquisitor hasn't done me any favors in my relationship with the Abyssal Hunters, or even the Ægir, so I got rid of it.
[Character(name="avg_4009_irene_1#1$1")]
[name="Irene"]But abandoning a faith that's supported me to this day, especially after the untimely demise of my maestro... has not been an easy decision.
[Character(name="avg_4009_irene_1#1$1")]
[name="Irene"]Please... let's not talk about this now. Maybe if we meet again someday.
[Character(name="avg_4042_lumen_1#10$1")]
[name="Jordi"]I'm sorry.
[Character(name="avg_4009_irene_1#1$1")]
[name="Irene"]It's just...
Irene looks at the sculpture in the plaza. A scaled-down version of the Eye of Iberia.
In the chaos of battle, streets were torn up, houses were destroyed, and makeshift tents were erected.
And the statue has always looked out over all of it.
[Character(name="avg_4009_irene_1#7$1")]
[name="Irene"]Even though our enemy is well beyond the reach of the law, Iberia must banish this blasphemy.
[Character(name="avg_4009_irene_1#7$1")]
