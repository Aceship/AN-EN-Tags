[name="Saint Carmen"]And did you find them? Are there more... false bishops, presiding over the sea's invasion of the land?

[name="Calm Townsperson"]Without concrete evidence, I can only speculate as to who their leader is.
[name="Calm Townsperson"]But Mayor Thiago, a worker from the Iberian hinterlands, is nominally the mayor of this town.
[name="Calm Townsperson"]Since the Eye of Iberia project was scrapped and the Inquisition made quick work of the traitors in Gran Faro, it's been no secret that he has been a pointed critic of the Inquisition.

[name="Saint Carmen"]Thiago... One of Gran Faro's laborers, sheltering the cultists. It would seem we have our next target, Dame Kal'tsit.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_461_1#1$1")]
[name="Calm Townsperson"]There's one other thing. Umm, Lord Carmen, the Penal Battalion seems to have come under attack.
[Character(name="avg_npc_447_1#4$1")]
[name="Saint Carmen"]What...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_447_1#3$1")]
[name="Saint Carmen"]They've invested a Tercio just to quash the evil writhing in Gran Faro, to the point that it's a rare luxury to see even a single badge. What could they up against?
[Character(name="avg_npc_461_1#1$1")]
[name="Calm Townsperson"]The nethersea brand has seeped through the ground to the surface, drawing a circle roughly fifty kilometers around Gran Faro.
[name="Calm Townsperson"]And, it's a perfect circle, almost as if it was drawn with a compass...
[name="Calm Townsperson"]It's not the town that's been surrounded, though. It's us.
