The Seaborn continues to increase its speed, appearing to leave an afterimage of itself in place.
It strides and bounds, and in an instant, is already on the opposite side of the deck. Barely touching the ground, it dives straight into the ocean.
But something else is even faster than it.
A black shadow cuts off its retreat and smashes it to the floor. There, away from the light, something sears a mark into the deck, causing the entire ship to shudder.
