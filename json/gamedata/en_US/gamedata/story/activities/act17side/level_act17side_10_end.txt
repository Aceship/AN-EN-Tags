Jordi knows that if doesn't take this opportunity, then he'll drift into the endless ocean along with the ship.
There's no other choice. He has to return to the Eye of Iberia and hide inside the lighthouse.
Just like he hid in that little town for over a decade.
Just like he hid when Dario died.
Just like with Thiago.
He clings to the mast to avoid falling into the aberrant waves. Mon3tr is visibly dissatisfied, urging him on.
Sea Terrors leap from the water's surface from time to time, darting back and forth rapidly and kicking up plumes of water. The Eye of Iberia is already becoming smaller and smaller.
He sees words carved crookedly into the boat's mast:
'Gran Faro'

Alfonso slowly lowers himself into the throne. He closes his eyes.
The warmth of the bright Iberian sun as it splashes at an angle across the deck.
The aroma of a winery. The melody of his hometown.
A damp and empty room. Freshly burgeoning petri dishes.
The ocean's waves.
The ocean he once knew. The warmth of Garcia's hand. Breogan's lonely countenance. Carmen's smile. His comrades' roars resonating through the sky.
[character]
He opens his eyes, and lets out a hearty laugh as everything is consumed by the flames.
His laughter crosses through time, until it reaches a small town of pomegranate flowers, where one can smell the sea upon the breeze, and mingles with the first cries of a newborn child.
Alfonso. That is what the people call him.
He lifts his old, rusty blade, and places it against his neck. He prays. He laughs.

The ship breaks apart.
The glow of the flame blankets a sea that had been silent for nearly a hundred years.
An era comes to an end.
A legend passes into history.
In the distance, the sun rises.
Here sinks the Stultifera, and with it, the long-cherished wishes of Iberia, nay, of all civilization.
All succumbing to calamity.
