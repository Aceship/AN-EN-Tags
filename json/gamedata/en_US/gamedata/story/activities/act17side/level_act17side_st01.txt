'Terra', 'the land', 'these lands', the nations 'across the world'.
These terms and the language around them flow in widespread use only because of how narrow they actually are.
Has there ever been some majestic language of the ancient past that could describe everything between heaven and earth? Where we put into words the 'everything' we might encounter in our day-to-day lives?
A grandiose term encompassing the earth, the sky, and even the seas of which the landbound nations know so little? A single word to narrate millennia of life's progress?
Where among the collective mind of mankind is such a word, Kal'tsit?

[name="Kal'tsit"]I'm sure you know the answer yourself.
[name="Prudent Elder"]I know quite a bit myself, yet still I find myself asking, day after day. No man may truly escape the unknown, and the unknown will forever torment mankind.
[name="Kal'tsit"]......
[name="Kal'tsit"](Ancient Sarkaz language) 'Alma.' 'World.'
[name="Prudent Elder"]Hm. And here I thought you would go with the Sargonian word 'Alam'. The same idea, I think.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Yours was a Sarkaz language?
[name="Kal'tsit"]It was.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Strange. You're a Feline who calls herself a doctor, yet your first instinct is to use the devils' tongue.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Your identity is like the ever-changing clouds above the sea. Never content to remain the same.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Language will not change its essence for such trifles.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Language, hmm... Now look here, Kal'tsit. A well.

[name="Prudent Elder"]Do you know how to draw water from it? Do you know how the Iberians used these blue cornerstones to build their houses?
[name="Kal'tsit"]If the Iberian nobility hadn't let their pride go to their heads, the ocean would surely have made the nation an impenetrable fortress.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The well is deep, and we're very close to the shore.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Look. It hasn't yet dried up. There is a false sun inside.
[name="Kal'tsit"]We should be on our way, sir.
The elderly man does not answer her. He simply picks up a small rock in silence.
The rock could not be more commonplace, with no particular reason to fiddle with. Yet, as though absorbed in the sensation of the sea breeze on his skin, he continues to gaze at the bottom of the well.
Kal'tsit doesn't push the issue. She silently waits for the man in front of her to answer. She sees that the clouds are moving. The winds are strong.
[name="Prudent Elder"]There is no rush, Kal'tsit. There is no rush. We have ample time for rest... no matter the arrangements you've made.
[name="Prudent Elder"]If I dropped this rock into the well, how long would it take for us to hear the splash?
[name="Kal'tsit"]About five to six seconds.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Even the most simple Iberian knows how to make use of the sea. Knowledge that went into this deep coastal well.
[name="Kal'tsit"]And yet, a Victorian farmer or Columbian worker might not even know what the vast sea looks like.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Hmm... Kal'tsit, how many questions have I asked you on our journey so far?
The old man holds his arm out, the rock still in his palm. Then he lets go, sending it tumbling downward.
Despite its rapid descent, the two of them lock their eyes onto it. Yet without adequate sunlight, they soon find themselves unable to follow its trek into the depths.
It has been two, perhaps three seconds. Nothing but silence shrouds the two of them. Even the wind has come to a halt.
How quiet, Kal'tsit thinks to herself. How quiet indeed.

*Plop*
The quiet sound echoes through the well's walls, as though reminding them that, in that brief moment lasting but a few seconds, all the lands are still.
[name="Kal'tsit"]One hundred twenty-three. Quite a bewitching number.
[name="Prudent Elder"]One hundred twenty-three questions, over one hundred twenty-three years. The Inquisition boasts not a single Inquisitor older than me.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Most have died in battle, a few of old age, and even fewer gave in to cowardice during their endless ordeal. It did not end very well for them.
[name="Prudent Elder"]I've experienced all there is of Iberia. I've seen its fleets setting sail, and heard the Victorian envoys quivering.
[name="Prudent Elder"]It was a rude awakening when the Profound Silence destroyed our nation. My countrymen are still drowning in their hatred for the disaster, and confused over the loss of their dream.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Liberi don't live long lives. Even the Liberi Elders, the oldest and healthiest of them, are unable to shoulder Iberia's present calamity.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Your age is a miracle. One forged by the Inquisition, and which also grants you an unprecedented sense of devotion.
[name="Kal'tsit"]In that era, when both glory and ideology began to crumble, you and the earliest Inquisition members were revered as 'Saints.'
[name="Prudent Elder"]'Saints.' A title for those who once served as a guiding beacon for mankind. But just like firewood, it's become nothing but ashes.
[name="Prudent Elder"]I've watched the seasons cycle by a full hundred and twenty-three times, yet it seems only the cold winters have left their mark on me. I've seen so many truths with my own eyes, yet can never recall the sight of spring.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Kal'tsit...
[name="Kal'tsit"]Yes?
The look in the old man's eyes changes.
Faith is a language, and prayers can pave roads. At this very moment, the nation of Iberia, or perhaps an existence beyond that, is caressing its chin, examining the wind speed.
[name="Prudent Elder"]So far, I've lived one hundred twenty-three years. I've asked you one hundred twenty-three questions, based on my personal experiences.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Nonetheless, you answered each and every one. You know everything that I know.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Man is making progress, and new secrets will forever emerge, yet our knowledge will never be able to overcome that wall we call 'the known.'
[name="Prudent Elder"]Regardless, the enemy we face belongs to the other side of that wall, in the dark forest that lies beyond.
[name="Prudent Elder"]And you, Kal'tsit. Do you belong to our side of the wall... or to the depths of that forest?
[name="Kal'tsit"]That is up to you.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Hoh... You might even know the number of leaves on its trees. What a terrifying woman.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Make no mistake, the saints of Iberia remain the pinnacle that humanity can reach. Yet you've exceeded that, marking you as inhuman.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Perhaps you've extended your life with special Arts, perhaps you've inherited some kind of ancient identity, or perhaps you possess a soul that had great ambitions.
[name="Kal'tsit"]......
[name="Prudent Elder"]Even if our faith is only a lie built atop ideology, we nevertheless once held onto it firmly. What is truly saddening, though, is that when old age finally bests us all, we will have not yet managed to solve our problems.
[name="Prudent Elder"]While those of us who have bested old age—via Originium Arts or other means—will only come to fear endless suffering at the hands of our enemies.
[name="Kal'tsit"]When did Ægir become such an unknown terror to Iberia?
[name="Prudent Elder"]How could an unarmed child so easily accept the help of a stranger brandishing a weapon?
[name="Kal'tsit"]What if that child were about to drown?
[name="Prudent Elder"]Then we would still require proof. Is Ægir's current situation really as you say? Can the Seaborn and their source truly be defeated?
[name="Prudent Elder"]If you cannot back up these claims, then Iberia will not trust you. I will not trust you.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Before I die, you... you must all prove it to Iberia.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Otherwise, the seawater will quench the flame of civilization. Before the other nations can prepare, they will swarm past Iberia... and tear this 'world' apart.
[name="Prudent Elder"]Perhaps this too—the refutation of Terran civilization—is itself a part of their survival-of-the-fittest mindset.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Or perhaps there is nothing inherently different between us and them.

[name="Alty"]—A Lateran chapel! And in such a great shape, even right next to the sea! Unbelievable! This place's style really has a different vibe, though.
[name="Alty"]I mean, as long as there are Laterans in chapels, we can jam whenever, but this place just feels so gloomy... Hm?

[name="Thiago"]You'd best stay away from the sea, Jordi. The chapel is clean and safe. Just stay there.
[name="Thiago"]Don't worry about anything else. Not a lot of the young ones came back this year. Most who left looked for ways to move to the big cities. And now we rely on the Inquisition's handouts to get by.
[name="Thiago"]You should think about what I said and leave this place. The folks here are the families of the workmen who gathered here to maintain the lighthouse in the past, but times have changed. This place will be abandoned sooner or later.

Jordi walks down the street quietly.
Seeing the old man in front of him hunching over more and more, he can't help but think back to how he looked just last year.
As if to prove how time slowly overtakes us all, senility is always silent. From the moment you wake up to when you fall asleep, every second is like a gasp for air.
But Jordi never complained. He's used to this life, after all.

[name="Jordi"]I'm pretty happy with my life right now. I get to help out at the chapel. Sometimes I help take care of the children, and sometimes I help patch up the injured workmen.
[name="Jordi"]I even got to know that Liberi who came from out of town the other day. He's so different from everyone else. He said his name is Elysium. You don't have to worry about me.
[name="Jordi"]It's been a long time since the Inquisition came to town. We don't always have to be so nervous.
[Character(name="avg_4042_lumen_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_451_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Thiago"]That's not a chapel, lad. It's a sentry post. The Inquisition set it up to keep their eyes on us, back when we were still trying to repair the lighthouse.
[Character(name="avg_4042_lumen_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_451_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Thiago"]But now that the coastline is peaceful and the work on the Eye of Iberia is shelved, of course the Inquisition doesn't give a toss about us anymore.
[Character(name="avg_4042_lumen_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_451_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Thiago"]Still, to be fair, the Inquisition isn't completely useless. Only they can stop those...
