'The Last Knight.'
The title is as pompous as it is cliché. There have probably been hundreds of books written about the last knight, the swiftest knight, or the strongest knight.
But seeing how the Radiant Knight gifted it to her own sister, surely there must be more to it than that?
With that thought, Grani opens it up, only to find a bookmark wedged inside.
Written in wobbly Kazimierzian letters is a line that may well have been copied from the book.

Legend has it that the Last Knight returned to Iberia. The enemies reflected in his eyes were not living creatures, but rather, he charged at the mountains, the cities, and the waves.
Legend has it that the Last Knight settled by the coast, sustaining himself on the wind and taking shelter in the mist, until at last he forgot how to remove his helmet.
Legend has it that the Last Knight finally disappeared after clashing against the great waves. His family discovered what he'd left behind along the shore and brought it back to the Land of Knights, burying it deep in the mountains.

The High Inquisitor raises his lantern high, and the Sea Terror in turn retreats into the shadows of the reef.
When he looks around once more, he notices the reef is littered with corroded and broken weapons, soaked with the fresh blood of monsters.
Arms belonging to the Inquisition. As his mentor Carmen had said, it is not as if the Inquisition had never considered reclaiming the sole remaining lighthouse.

[Character]
Emotions.
Long-lost emotions.
From soldier to Inquisitor, and finally to one who sees the truth. He has been tempered, lost and reforged anew countless times. And thus, Dario became one of the few High Inquisitors in Iberia.
Only a single word separates an Inquisitor from a High Inquisitor, but that single word is the difference between heaven and earth.
He used to regard himself as resolute as steel. Before Iberia's enemies, his lantern would flicker, his sabre would glimmer, and every line of the Scriptures would be put into practice.
But now, he feels a type of strong emotion welling up within him. One not solely a product of the law and justice that is preached.
After acknowledging its rationality, High Inquisitor Dario accepts the fact that he is truly experiencing grief and anger. His handcannon takes aim at the Sea Terror, yet his eyes are directed towards the sea.

With his speed, he opts not to attack them, but instead leaps high into the air and bounds toward the lighthouse with a ferocious roar.

The knight lifts his head and looks up. The lighthouse did not budge an inch.
He shakes his twisted weapon disapprovingly. This long spear, once the creation of a master craftsman, is now inundated with the scent of the depths.
