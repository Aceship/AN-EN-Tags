The Sea Terrors gather around the main door, wandering, spinning.

She can see. She can see a strange ring on a patch of fluorescent ground.
Charred corpses are stacked high into a mountain. The deaths of tens of thousands of their kin had imprinted a new behavior upon the Sea Terrors—
—Do not approach the lighthouse.
[PlaySound(key="$burningloop1", volume=0.6, loop=true,channel="fire")] 
A feeble flame still flickers. It was originally a great bonfire.
Before the Sea Terrors had perished in a tide of death, there was nothing flammable here at all.
At the heart of the flame stands a single man. He lifts his lantern and leans on his sword, just as he did when he learned to stand guard in his youth—motionless.

The lantern in Dario's hand seems to echo Carmen's farewell. In an instant, the fire swallows even more Sea Terrors before the raging flame then wraps around the silent High Inquisitor.
His already-clouded eyes are still gazing far into the distance.
Carmen remains silent for a long time before Dario's statue-like body.
Kal'tsit does not interrupt Carmen's mourning. She only takes in the scene with her eyes. There aren't many signs of the Hunters' activity here.
The High Inquisitor remained here alone, staving off the surging tides of Sea Terrors until his life was spent.
But even if the soldier's lifeforce had bled dry long ago, the Sea Terrors still feared him. Because his flame had not extinguished, because his light had not dimmed.
The Inquisitor had turned himself into a force of nature, a pledge to defend the sanctity of the Eye of Iberia even beyond death.
After a long time, Carmen lifts his head.
Only then does Kal'tsit see the signs of age in the old man in front of her. Though the Inquisition had used various methods to prolong his life, in this moment he could no longer hide the fatigue in his eyes.
He turns his head and looks towards Kal'tsit, then back to Dario, who was gradually disappearing into the flame.
