I see it.
I see Alfonso heading to the great hall every day. He's named it 'Iberia.'
He's moved the mirror from his bedroom to the hall, and spends day after day examining himself.
Ever since the head chef and young Jamie were executed, he and I are the only ones left.

We have consumed their flesh and blood. At first, we started fires to cook them. Then, we were forced to devour them raw.
Even the most powerful Inquisitors were awed by Alfonso's strength. He was the object of so many young sailors' admiration. There was nothing he couldn't do.

Gladiia does not search for the Hunter's whereabouts.
She begins to look around her.
[character]
Ever since she boarded this vessel, her surroundings have filled her with a sense of nostalgia—the materials, the decorations, the handiwork.
Breogan, a genius from the Academy of Sciences, was an Ægir. Without a doubt, this was his domain.
The mystery behind why this ship hadn't sunk in decades was itself the message Breogan wanted to leave to the Ægir. A brand new fusion of Originium and terrestrial technologies.
But what exactly is it?

Alfonso doesn't answer the Seaborn's question. He simply chops and hacks at it again and again, like meat on a cutting board.
The chief mate bites down on the Seaborn in a death grip. Its crown falls to the ground during the struggle, but it does not care to pick it up.
Alfonso cuts off the Seaborn's tentacles, which join the crown on the ground. The chief mate pauses for a moment.
Ah... Garcia, Garcia.
Look at your crown, and at that tentacle. Do you understand what you've become now?
