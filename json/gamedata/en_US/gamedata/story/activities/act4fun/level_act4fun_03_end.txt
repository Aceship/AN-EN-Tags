In a certain place in a certain city on a certain month and year, there was a livestreamer by the name of U-Official, commonly known as Streamer U.
She worked hard on her streams, extended her streaming schedule, and increased their frequency, but none of it seemed to remedy her paltry income.
Most viewers would leave after a quick glance, and of the very few who stuck around, few bothered donating.
She thought to herself that maybe she'd been putting effort into the wrong things.
So she tried to expand the scope of her streams, but the rapidly-changing themes didn't find much traction either.

After realizing that just working hard was getting her nowhere, she decided to register on the fan forums.
Here, she silently lurked and learned, hoping to improve herself.
Her hard work paid off, and she did indeed undergo a metamorphosis, successfully becoming a master keyboard warrior across multiple forums.

[name="Streamer U"] Of course livestreaming shouldn't be restricted to a single format! That's a clear sign that you're just a one-trick burdenbeast!
[name="Streamer U"] I'll change up my stream format however I want. And if you don't wanna stick around, sayonara.
[name="Streamer U"] No, no, no. If you're sitting around watching streams all day, there's something wrong with YOU.

[name="Streamer U"]Speaking of singing, I heard the awards won by that album featured by a certain record label next door all came from shilling out to fudge the data.
[name="Streamer U"]Those album sales numbers were also jacked up by their own internal buybacks.
[name="Streamer U"]If you don't believe me, I know a whole bunch of people who work there, and apparently stuff like that is pretty common in the industry.
[name="Streamer U"]Me? You guys don't get it at all. I didn't even bother trying to make it as a singer, because the filth of the music industry is beneath me.
[name="Streamer U"]That record label will definitely change their strategy in the future. Their upper management often asks for my opinion behind closed doors.
[name="Streamer U"]It's gonna be exactly what I said, you just wait and see. These companies are all the same.

Streamer U's special livestream sent shockwaves across the net, and the makeup of her fans rapidly began to change as she chased certain people away while attracting other curious viewers.
She actually profited quite a bit from it, and the platform even packaged her as a troll streamer and set up a specific stream category for her.
Having tasted the sweet nectar of success, Streamer U naturally began to intensify her antics.
As expected, she soon received a court summons for slandering many individuals and companies, as well as spreading various rumors.
Due to her wide reach, Streamer U had to pay a large sum as compensation, making all her previous income look like a drop in the bucket.
By all indications, she can only go so far as a streamer.
'I, I just repeated what my other friends said. I didn't know it was fake! I just wanted to share it with my fans, and didn't mean any harm!'
'Why isn't an apology enough? Look, I'm sorry and didn't mean it. It's the fault of the people who spread these things.'
'I've realized that what I did was wrong. Please, I'm really sorry!'
'......'
'N-Now that I've paid up, will your record label still consider me?'
