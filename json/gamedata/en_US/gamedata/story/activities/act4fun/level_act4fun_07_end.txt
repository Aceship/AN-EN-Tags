In a certain place in a certain city on a certain month and year, there was a livestreamer by the name of U-Official, commonly known as Streamer U.
She was extraordinarily ordinary.
She didn't do anything wild, just as she had assured Click, but in the process, also missed out on a lot of opportunities that would've given her a spotlight on the intercity net.
She just did her ordinary thing in her rental unit — rolling out of bed, eating, streaming, going offline, going to sleep.

So, Streamer U staggered out the door without a clue as to where she's going. She resigns herself to fate and her own two legs, letting them take her on a journey nobody has ever gone on before.

Streamer U has little recollection of what happened afterwards, only that she remembers talking with that respected senpai for a while. About what, she can't exactly recall.
Coupled with the fact that she received the invitation letter and video from Click as soon as she got home, she quickly put the matter behind her.

[name="???"]If my will is a higher level of existence than yours, who is the will above mine? And if there's another higher will above that one, can there ever be an end?
[name="???"]Does it extend ad infinitum, or stop at a certain point? Or... is it an Ouroboros, with neither beginning nor end?
