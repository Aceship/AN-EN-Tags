If you want to find content to stream, you can't go wrong by starting from your own experiences. I've been to Kazimierz's Grand Knight Territory before, and that place is NEVER lacking in content.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ulika")] The Grand Knight Territory... I heard there are a whole bunch of hotties there. Is that true?

Let's worry about the hotties later. For now, try <@tu.kw>deploying yourself</> somewhere first, and shooting some street scenes with the passersby.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_cammou")] The person you're filming right now is a competition knight, and while their armor looks pretty cool, you see this kind of stuff so often it's hard to say what kind of response it'll get.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ulika")] Does that mean I have to find some major celebs? Like I have the resources for that...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_cammou")] Don't be discouraged. You never know what big names will pop up.
