In a certain place in a certain city on a certain month and year, there was a livestreamer by the name of U-Official, commonly known as Streamer U.
Anyone who watched her stream was mesmerized, almost like she possessed some kind of mysterious, bewitching power.
Her channel was the most harmonious channel in the intercity net—no, perhaps all of Terra.
The hand-to-mouth cheered her on, the high-rollers donated, the outspoken were careful with their words, and the ill-intentioned had no place to hide among them.
Whenever her streams ended, her fans immediately scoured the net for clips to relive the moment.
Although she made nowhere near as much in donations as the biggest streamers, she could feel everyone's love for her from all the tiny, tiny donations she got.
Although it would take years to pay back her loans with them, she was already the happiest streamer in all of Terra.
She truly thought that it was love, not money, that supported her through each and every one of her debt-ridden days.
Those days seemed like they would last forever...
Yet, one ordinary day, like any ordinary person, Streamer U came down with a minor cold. Urged by all parties, she had no choice but to stop streaming for a week.

It was a long week.
Lying in bed with the thermometer in her mouth, Streamer U spent every moment thinking about her fans and worrying.
If she could recover just a day sooner, she would get to meet her fans a day earlier...
But the cold, merciless as it was, lasted an entire week.

The lobby was almost empty. The number of fans was nowhere close to what she previously had.
Is love... really so fickle?
Streamer U didn't get it.
Just then, a fan sent her a link in the chat and told her that this was where her love had gone.
Flustered, she immediately clicked it and saw something she would never forget.

The touching first encounter between mother and daughter took the intercity net by storm.
Urged by the platform and the fans, Streamer U and U-Gigamax even had a competitive match in a game, which ended in her cruel defeat.
The fans thought they would get to see the loving mother and filial daughter continue coexisting in harmony with one another, but how wrong they were.
They could never imagine just how crazy someone who was once well-loved would become upon losing that love.

To mount a comeback against this Anonymous—the one who made the AI call him her papa and Streamer U her mama—and, more importantly, to win back the love that belonged to her...
Streamer U put everything on the line—her quality of life, her connections, her savings, her breach of contract penalties... and even her pride—all to make U-Gigamax completely disappear from the intercity net.
The platform told her bluntly that that was impossible, and so she went for the next best thing—
She would proclaim authority over love itself. She would seize U-Gigamax's soul itself.
She would not allow anyone who sees this avatar to even think of that slightly robotic AI sound. They must hear nothing but her voice in their heads!
Alas, she lost.
Thus, the legend of Streamer U became but a prelude to the epic of U-Gigamax.
That said, she was at least able use legal means to win some compensation for the use of her likeness.
Of course, it was nowhere near enough to help her pay back her loans.
