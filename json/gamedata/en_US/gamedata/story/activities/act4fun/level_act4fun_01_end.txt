In a certain place in a certain city on a certain month and year, there was a livestreamer by the name of U-Official, commonly known as Streamer U.
Things were a bit touch-and-go at first, but at some point, she felt like she'd figured out the trick to streaming.
Any material she'd casually find to stream would quickly go viral on the intercity net, and any random topic she'd bring up would set off waves of discussion throughout her audience.
Even the products she'd recommend purely on a whim would fly off the shelves in no time.
Her streaming career rode the fast track to success, and U-Official quickly became a celebrity all across the net.
It wasn't long before she was invited to host a variety of public events, up to and including the groundbreaking ceremony of a new nomadic city plate.
Streamer U already knew the reason for her success.
Because she is the Last All-arounder Beauty Girl.
Is there anyone more suited for livestreaming than the Last All-arounder Beauty Girl? Of course not!
Livestreaming was her god-given duty. There was no need to plan, no need to worry. As long as she showed up to do whatever, she would effortlessly command everyone's attention. And if she actually tried, she could easily take the entire city by storm.
If the curve of one's destiny is shaped like a U, then without a doubt she had already passed the bend and was about to climb to life's next peak.

[name="Streamer U"]The twenty minute break used to be for ads, right? But they changed it last minute; now you're interviewing me. I've already talked to your producer.

[name="Staff Worker"]Huh?!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4091_ulika_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Streamer U"]More importantly, this isn't your regularly scheduled interview, it's supposed to be a hot mic 'accident'—in other words, we're pretending I forgot to turn off my mic and end up broadcasting it to the entire city!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4091_ulika_1#3$1",focus="r")]
[name="Staff Worker"]What's the point of that?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4091_ulika_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Streamer U"]First, it adds a chill vibe to the whole thing, and gets the audience feeling, like, 'wow, even this famous streamer makes mistakes, just like me, fr!' Which makes me more relatable.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4091_ulika_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Streamer U"]Great question, I'm glad you asked.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4091_ulika_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Streamer U"]If I had to say, there are a lot of factors at play, but the big three are my talent, my beauty, and my profound wisdom.

......
And so, the two begin to chat.
Streamer U goes on and on, boasting to the staff worker about her various strong suits.
Tooting one's own horn like this would normally be off-putting, but coming from her somehow made it extremely charming.
And not just to the staff worker who was in on the bit; everyone who'd realized it was a hot mic moment was waiting for her to rip into someone, and all felt a sense of admiration and awe well up from the bottom of their hearts.

[name="Streamer U"]And if we're talking climate, well... It's so damp and sticky, I have to wonder if you guys have any humidity-causing Catastrophes nearby.
[name="Streamer U"]The local food and drink isn't anything to write home about either. Fried, overcooked, fried, overcooked, fried, overcooked. Not a single healthy, refreshing item on the menu.
[name="Streamer U"]Right, and there's not much in the way of entertainment either. The biggest event I've seen around here is a roadside supermarket promotion.

Even the furious producer is unable to put the slightest bit of pressure on Eureka.
Temporary off-air announcement. Liquidated damages. Loans. Interest. Loans. Interest. Loans. Interest.
Well, whatever those are, it's not her problem.
After all, the outspoken Eureka has already become bona fide famous.
Unfortunately, she's also gotten to the point where no platform is willing to believe that she can just do a straight broadcast. No one can predict the next bombshell to come out of her mouth.
