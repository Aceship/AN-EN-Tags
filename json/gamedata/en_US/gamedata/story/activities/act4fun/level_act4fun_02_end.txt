In a certain place in a certain city on a certain month and year, there was a livestreamer by the name of U-Official, commonly known as Streamer U.
When she wakes up every morning, everything is brand new. This, of course, includes a new barrage of comments leaving new scars in her heart, no less piercing than real bullets.
Streamer U has always been extremely anxious. Anxious about negative feedback from her audience.
Though in truth, not many hold genuine hostility towards her.
She isn't lacking in talent, and reveals her hardworking side every now and then. How could anyone other than her competitors hate such a dedicated girl?
However, she always manages to pick out the single cynical comment out of a hundred, before falling into a death spiral of panic, defeat, and self-doubt.
She's had conversations with people representing the platform. They mostly talked business, but also expressed a desire for her to 'cut loose a bit,' which they felt would benefit both parties. However, she could only see this as a warning.
With the threat of nonexistence looming over her, she indeed tried to 'cut loose' for a few streams. But the results were appallingly bad, and her follower count actually fell rather than increased—
Though only a few dozen would unsubscribe each time, the pressure building up inside her heart finally reached critical mass.

This time, she found herself at a loss for words on stream.
She simply stared into the camera with a blank, lifeless expression for half an hour.
Finally, she said:
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4091_ulika_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Streamer U"]Eureka! Eureka!!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4091_ulika_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Streamer U"]I get it now!

Ignoring the stream of comments—some showing concern, others suspicious or derisive—Streamer U went offline.
The next day, when she came on air...

[name="Streamer U"]New faces shall soon have their eyes opened, old faces will have to deal with it.
[name="Streamer U"]Hello, everyone. Neither I nor my stream matter. All that matters is that I do what must be done.
[name="Streamer U"]Next, I shall offer a chant for everyone, followed by meditation time. Those who were not fated to be, Alt-F4. The rest of those ordained by fate will rejoice. Now, my assistant will help us turn to the correct verse in the scriptures.

[name="Sussy Higashinese"]I cometh!

[name="Sussy Higashinese"]This is a wooden fish sculpture carved by mine own hands but a few days prior. Please strike it aloud!
[name="Streamer U"]...No birth, no death. No defilement, no purity. No food, no drink.
[charslot(fadetime=0)]
[name="Sussy Higashinese"]I do believe thou art mistaken; it should be, 'no increase, no decrease.'
[name="Streamer U"]Oh... 'No increase, no decrease.'
[charslot(fadetime=0)]
[name="Sussy Higashinese"]Thou must've recited of food and drink due to thy hunger. But until the proper time comes, patience is another aspect of the practice.
[charslot(fadetime=0)]
[name="Sussy Higashinese"]I do implore thee, be not impatient. I shall use the mop next to the wall to perform a blade dance for thee, in hopes of cutting off thoughts of excess within thy heart.

Initially, older viewers saw this as some kind of whimsical performance art, but after a few days of streams, they found that Streamer U seemed to be dead serious.
Her former subs cancelled one after another, replaced by a torrent of viewers who came to poke fun at her.
But she was always either chanting, meditating, or doing some meaningless chore such as carrying water or chopping firewood with her suspicious Higashinese roommate, never once looking at the chat.
Even after the band of glory-seekers left, a group of viewers who chanted and meditated alongside her slowly assembled.
The platform saw this as an opportunity to save the washed-up streamer, but when they arrived at Streamer U's rental unit, not a soul could be found.
Since then, nobody has even seen Streamer U, or rather, Eureka.
The only gift she left for the city was a note that said, 'All is nothingness,' a pile of bad debts, and a legend.
As for the fact that her rental unit was turned into a bucket of cold water, a slap in the face, a cold reality check for tourists... Well, that wasn't something Eureka could've foreseen.
