In a certain place in a certain city on a certain month and year, there was a livestreamer by the name of U-Official, commonly known as Streamer U.
She had her future mapped out in meticulous detail, and was already taking steps to bring her plans to fruition.
She was not asking for much. All she wanted was to keep her streams' popularity up and her loans at a manageable level until Click returned or she heard back from Rhodes Island.
But with Click acknowledging she had what it took to gain a foothold in the streaming world, even if she didn't try <i>too</i> hard, things were still bound to work out, right?
With that in mind, she started streaming. Her streaming style was spontaneous, carefree, and to her heart's content.
When she got sick of a game, she started playing another. When she got tired of singing, she stopped right there and then. When she got bored of chatting, she cut off the stream.
While there are those who like that sort of streamer, most people don't watch streams to see how selfish, temperamental, or irresponsible the streamer can be.
And thus, in a small corner of the nomadic city, Streamer U's first hater was born.
After that, her legion of haters grew exponentially, and it wasn't long before they took over the chat.
At first, she did not waver in the face of all the malicious comments in chat.
She thought the haters were nothing unmanageable, but then reality dealt her a merciless blow.

It was a letter. Streamer U opened the envelope to find her personal information spelled out with letters cut from all kinds of publications.
Combined with the message in the chat, the letter's meaning could not be clearer.
'We know who you are.'
After that, worse and worse things started being delivered to her.
But Streamer U, unyielding as she is, was not going to bow and scrape before the haters. She would confront them head on and keep streaming.

[name="Streamer U"]Next up, an order of ten premium fin sashimi bentos that a fan so thoughtfully ordered for me, to be paid for on delivery—Too bad, it never even got delivered.

[name="Streamer U"]You guys really should come up with some new ideas. All the delivery guys around here know about your antics already.

......
All the haters' extreme actions did was reinforce her strong, tragic character, and it even led to a slow but steady increase in the number of donations. This had them restless and agitated.
Finally, they started to go to her apartment to spray graffiti and dump trash and wastewater everywhere...
They even stuffed chewing gum into her door's keyhole.
Faced with this onslaught, Streamer U finally found herself on the defensive.
Her hair was getting messier and messier by the stream. Sometimes, she had bags under her eyes. Every now and then, she went on cam looking absolutely filthy.
She even stopped doing her hater delivery unboxing segments.
It might be kinda fun to watch a streamer unbox a bunch of Originium slugs, but nobody wants to keep watching a streamer show all the cuss words graffitied on their front door.
The haters rejoiced. They knew that her end was near.

Streamer U watched her heartbroken stan scamper out the door and found herself unable to say even a word for the better part of the day.
Dejected, she at last made it back to her terminal.
She brought a cup of water to her mouth with her trembling hand, and not a moment later, she noticed the popup notice on her screen:
