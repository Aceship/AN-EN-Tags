[name="Mafioso"]   Mr. Rat King.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034")]
[name="Rat King"]   Oh, it's you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   What of them?
[Character(name="avg_npc_034",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Rat King"]   I said as much, this city has no need of further bloodshed. If they can escape, let them escape.
[name="Rat King"]   To miss your old master is noble. And you spent your loyalty to buy the rights of your fellows to live on. That was a charitable act. But you must not get greedy in your requests.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   ...Y- yeah. But after that, that was way out of step with Lungmen's rules...
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Rat King"]   You learn quick.
[name="Rat King"]   I have heard that long before Siracusa became what it is today, there was a time when the mafia there had some unwritten rules kept for survival's sake.
[name="Rat King"]   The people obeyed them, the people accepted them, and in turbulent times, the mafia came to be the most trusted group in society.
[name="Rat King"]   Then, they sold out, they traded in violence, and we came to where we are today.
[name="Rat King"]   Lungmen has its laws, and I have my own code.
[name="Rat King"]   Even Penguin Logistics has a set of rules for how they do whatever they want at all times, although they're all wildly different.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   ——
[name="Mafioso"]   Mr. Rat King, if the boss back then... if Mr. Gambino didn't pull his sword on you the first time you met, would things still have turned out like this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Rat King"]   I gave him a chance. Both before and after that moment. It was far more than just that.
[name="Rat King"]   But from time to time, and especially in business, first impressions are very important. You understand?
[Character(name="avg_npc_034",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   ...I understand.

[name="Capone"]   So you ain't dead. That's a surprise. Turns out the Rat King ain't so thorough.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#2",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   ...The wound you gave me still aches, Capone. I'm real glad you came to face me yourself.
[name="Gambino"]   So I can kill you with my own hands.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#2",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   All of Lungmen's after us. I really don't wanna waste time on you.
[name="Capone"]   So let's get this over with.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   You're gonna pay for betraying the Family...

[name="???"]   Haha. Family. Family, huh.
[name="???"]   That word sure brings me back. Hey, have either of you seen Texas?
[Character(name="avg_npc_027#2")]
[name="Capone"]   Th- that smell...!
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3")]
[name="Gambino"]   ...a Lone Wolf. What are you doing in Lungmen?

[name="Lappland"]   Well, Texas is here. Need I say more?
[name="Lappland"]  By the way, can you really call yourselves a "Family" after you bolted from Siracusa to get away from all the responsibilities of being a Family? Can you still call yourselves "Sicilian?"
[name="Lappland"]  Would the one who plundered your proud and glorious history... Miss Sicily herself, would she agree?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3")]
[name="Gambino"]   Shut up! Don't ever speak of her in front of me!
[name="Gambino"]  You're nothin' but a traitor! Who are you to call us...
[Character(name="char_140_whitew_1")]
[name="Lappland"]   That's enough, ass.
[name="Lappland"]   Oh, you're wounded? I smell blood. Wolf's blood. Mmm, is that what they call the smell of home?
[name="Lappland"]   Texas is different now, huh?
[name="Lappland"]   Really really different. A couple old friends from Siracusa come knocking on her door and she lets them leave Lungmen alive?
[name="Lappland"]   It's so inhospitable. Downright shameful. But it's okay, I'll finish the job for her.
[name="Lappland"]   Maybe if I bring her the corpses of a couple paisans from Siracusa that'll get her nice and worked up. Ooh, yeah, that's a great idea...
[name="Lappland"]   You think she can escape? From the shadow of her Family, I mean? From her past?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#2")]
[name="Gambino"]   ...Capone, stand firm.
[Character(name="avg_npc_027#2")]
[name="Capone"]   Hah. Now we're gonna fight side by side? What happened to your honor and Family?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#2")]
[name="Gambino"]   Call it self-preservation.
[Character(name="avg_npc_027#2")]
[name="Capone"]   Hmph. You scared?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#2")]
[name="Gambino"]   Let's just say I don't want her to be the one who kills me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_027#4")]
[name="Capone"]   ...Good point. If I'm gonna die, I'd rather make it to an open casket.
[Character(name="char_140_whitew_1")]
[name="Lappland"]   Hahahaha! Are you trembling?
[name="Lappland"]   You're going to fight me when you can barely stand up straight?
[name="Lappland"]   All right, sure. Watching the life leave your eyes as you struggle to live sounds like a good time.
[name="Lappland"]   I'm going to count to ten.
[name="Lappland"]   Run.
