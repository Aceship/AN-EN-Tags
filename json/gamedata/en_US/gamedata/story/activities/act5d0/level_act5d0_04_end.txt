[name="Passerby B"]  Aren't those the Penguin Logistics people? They're fighting again?
[name="Passerby B"]  Give 'em a left hook! Now right! C'mon! Yeah!
[name="Passerby A"]  They always win every fight. It's boring.
[name="Passerby B"]  Yeah. Hey, you mooks in black, don't lose too bad!

[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Our goal is to take their place. No need to bury those idiots. I think you can do the math on this one?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Texas, she's Texas. Then you got the Laterano girl and the MDL princeling. You think we can leave 'em breathing and still sleep at night?
[name="Gambino"]   We gotta salt the earth here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   That's a good way to get a lot of eyes on us. We ain't the only seat at this table.

[name="Gambino"]   You done a lot for the Family, but you're lucky I ain't kicked you to the curb yet.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_028")]
[name="Gambino"]   And it's after we blew it in Siracusa that I realized: we don't pass up an opportunity. We're not gonna compromise, negotiate, and fall into another trap.
[name="Gambino"]   We're gonna use everything we got to totally wipe out the competition.
[name="Gambino"]   We're gonna do this the old way, like the true Sicilians we are.
