[name="Exusiai"]   Yahoo!
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]   Eyes on the road, Exusiai! Hands on ten and two!
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   I finally caught you.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_101_sora_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Sora"]   Texas... please... slower next time...
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_101_sora_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   S- sorry. I was holding back as much as I could.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3")]
[name="Exusiai"]   But at least we're all back together. Now we gotta go find the boss.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7")]
[name="Exusiai"]   Wait, why do I feel like we're missing something?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   Huh?
[name="Texas"]   ...where's Bison?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   What? Wasn't he with you guys?

[name="Texas"]   ......
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3")]
[name="Sora"]   ...We didn't leave him back there did we?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#2",name2="char_101_sora_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   ...We're so used to doing things our own way, leaving him behind was kind of inevitable. 
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#2",name2="char_101_sora_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Sora"]   So then we should probably go back and get him?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#4")]
[name="Exusiai"]   Isn't Mostima here? I think he'll be okay.

[name="Texas"]   Let's not be too hard on the kid who shook off a crew of armed mobsters on a bicycle.
[name="Texas"]   ...No, it's an ambush. Exusiai!

[name="Gambino"]   Sure did. Thanks for leading the way.

[name="Gambino"]   Good evening, Penguin Logistics. I am Gambino Ricci, head of the Family.
[name="Gambino"]   And it looks like I've got a hostage.
[name="Gambino"]   But you ain't gonna make a scene over a little thing like this, eh?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   We left him behind...
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_201_moeshd#5",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]   Ain't that the honest truth.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   What do you want?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#4",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Hmph... I'm sick of you scuttling around like cockroaches, getting into my business, makin' yourselves a real pain in my tail.
[name="Gambino"]   That's the value of the little prince here. I got a hostage and all you can do is take me head on.
[name="Gambino"]   And that'll save me a lotta trouble. That turns my little penguin problem into a very solvable problem.
[name="Gambino"]   Penguin Logistics got nowhere to run.
[stopmusic(fadetime=2)]
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#4",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Texas"]   Yeah, okay. Great. Just the way I like it.

[name="Texas"]   Turns out we're thinking in the same direction.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#4")]
[name="Texas"]   Croissant, Sora, form up.
[name="Texas"]   Exusiai, cover us.
[name="Texas"]   Let's get our Bison back.
