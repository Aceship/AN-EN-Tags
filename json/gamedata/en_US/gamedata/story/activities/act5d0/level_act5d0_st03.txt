[name="Exusiai"]   Whew, tonight sure was a good time.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd")]
[name="Croissant"]   You wouldn't think it from the stinkin' pile of garbage we're sittin' in, but it was great. Just thinkin' about somebody else footin' the bill for all our expenses makes me all warm inside!
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]   Texas, if you figured it out earlier, you should have told us.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Texas"]   I just guessed.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#5",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]   You're a really bad liar, you know that...?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#5",name2="char_103_angel_1#8",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   The boss had it all planned out, didn't he? Don't sweat it~ Eating, drinking, and fighting are good for the body and good for the soul.

[name="Mostima"]   What's wrong? You're not going to join them?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   No, I'm okay.
[name="Bison"]   I just, how can I say this? I just feel like I can't accept it.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   You get used to it.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   If I'm used to it then it's all over.
[name="Bison"]   Like what was everything tonight even for? And Emperor, he...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   ...gave his life to make the party more fun.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Mostima, you told me you would be giving me a grade for my performance at Penguin Logistics, didn't you?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   I did. I've been thinking about it. And while you didn't exactly mesh with everybody, you made some great strides. That much is clear. Maybe...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   No.
[name="Bison"]   I'm not staying here.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Oh? I thought with everything that happened, you'd need Penguin Logistics to be a springboard for you to bigger and better things.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   That was the original idea. Turns out you had that all figured out...
[name="Bison"]   It's not that I think Penguin Logistics is terrible. Well, it is terrible.
[name="Bison"]   But I think, with Messengers like this, who live like this...
[name="Bison"]   Even though my common sense tells me it's ridiculously dangerous...
[name="Bison"]   I think it might be... what I actually want.
[name="Bison"]   Or maybe it's like I'll start to question reality if I don't look at it this way.
[name="Bison"]   ...like one, completely insane dream.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Yeah. Fistfights, explosions, and high altitude drops will do that to you.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Getting thrown into the deep end with Penguin Logistics isn't great for your mental health.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   But if you've made your decision, and as your fellow Messenger, I wish you luck.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...Thanks.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Especially since it means your father won't have any grounds to dock my pay.

[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   If I take my eyes off you for one second, you could vanish. And I got a lottttt of questions to ask you.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   A lot, huh...? Like about that incident back in Laterano?
[name="Mostima"]   With your sister? Or maybe... my horns?

[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   MOS! TI! MA!
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   All right, all right. I'll tell you.
[name="Mostima"]   ...But right not now. You've been digging into it on your own for a while now, so you must understand.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Um, I don't know why, but it's classified as a state secret now. Does that matter?
[name="Exusiai"]   I have to get closure on everything about you.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   You really do, huh...?
[name="Mostima"]   It could be a long and treacherous path, with your precious guns confiscated, the wicked watching you, hounding you to the mouth of hell?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#8",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Hm, that's weirdly specific.
[name="Exusiai"]   But no big deal. I run pretty fast. They'll never catch me!
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#8",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   Fine.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   You give up?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   I give up. Not that anyone could ever tell you what to do.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   That's not true. There's the boss. And Texas, I'll listen to Texas. Sometimes. Kinda.

[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#5",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]   He's an excellent new-comer to this industry. Is it okay to leave him like that?
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=1)]
[name="Croissant"]   Bison~ Lemme give ya a copy of the Great Foodie Guide. I did it up myself after real, in-person, on-site investigations!
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd",name2="char_325_bison_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   You wrote the Foodie Guide!

[Character(name="avg_npc_029",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   I know everything.
[name="Bison"]   Father and Emperor had a deal at the same time a Siracusan gang came up against the Rat King, is that right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_029#2",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=1)]
[name="Butler"]   Everything has a purpose, Young Master. You performed spectacularly well, given the circumstances. The Master of the House is most pleased.
[name="Butler"]   And yet, I...
[Character(name="avg_npc_029#2",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   Twice. That's how many times you followed my dad's order and did the trick with my shield.

[Character(name="avg_npc_029",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=1)]
[name="Butler"]   This kind of boundless optimism is born from the innumerable life-or-death experiences of a life well lived, Young Master.
[Character(name="avg_npc_029",name2="char_325_bison_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   I know. But they're Messengers. Why do they always risk their lives?
[Character(name="avg_npc_029",name2="char_325_bison_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Butler"]   That's what a Messenger does. Should you leave home, leave the Master of the House, and leave Lungmen, you too will come to understand.
[Character(name="avg_npc_029",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   ...I hope so.

[Character(name="avg_npc_029#3",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   Father's probably plotting something with Chief Wei right now. I'm sure it's something very important that I can't concern myself with.
[Character(name="avg_npc_029#3",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=1)]
[name="Butler"]   You are very clever, but the Master of the House did not make these choices to be rid of you. You will grow stronger, and more tenacious.

[name="Suffering?"]   Which reminds me, you must've made a lot of money this time around? How about sending some my way? A little hospitality?
[name="Mostima"]   We're both from Laterano. Who's the host here?
[name="Suffering?"]   Fine. By the way, this angel's halo is blindingly bright.
[name="Mostima"]   They get in the way sometimes.
[name="Suffering?"]   Lucky you don't have that problem, fallen angel.
[name="Mostima"]   Are you jealous? I could buy you a fluorescent lamp to wear on your head.
[name="Suffering?"]   Sounds like a pain. How do you deal with it?
[name="Mostima"]   Instinct. The moment we start using language, the halo appears.
[name="Suffering?"]   Like the first time you blurt out "mama" or "dada?" What a beautiful image.
[name="Mostima"]   Haha. Exusiai's first word was "sis." Even though they're not blood related, they still...
[name="Suffering?"]   Enough. Let's not talk about her sister. Even if Laterano doesn't care, it's not a topic for casual conversation.
[name="Suffering?"]   It's because you leveled this precious gun at the captain that you fell.
[name="Suffering?"]   Do you really plan to tell her the whole story someday? The little sister of your beloved battle-sister?
[name="Mostima"]   Hm... You've followed me this long and I still haven't told you. It might be that you, also my "beloved battle-sister..." have a really bad temper?
[name="Suffering?"]   I'm only under obligation to remind you that you must not speak even one word of what happened at Kazdel.
[name="Mostima"]   But what about my travel memoir?
[name="Suffering?"]   Sounds great. Hey, why don't you go get your staff back from that freaky guy before I write you up for it.
[name="Suffering?"]   You're running out of time.
