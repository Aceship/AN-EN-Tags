[name="Bison"]   Looking out at the city, all I can think about is how almost all of Lungmen's Messenger firms belong to my father.
[name="Bison"]   Penguin Logistics is the last. And the most independent. And the one with a ton of weird rumors swirling around it.
[name="Bison"]   My father gets along pretty well with Mr. Emperor, but we have to do more to really get them. Or at least I do.
[Character(name="avg_npc_029",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=1)]
