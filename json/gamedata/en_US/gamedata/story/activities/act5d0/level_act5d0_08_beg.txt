[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#4")]
[name="Mostima"]   Is everybody okay?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2")]
[name="Bison"]   Y- yeah. The whole building is gone... what in the world was that...?
[PlayMusic(intro="$penguinlogistics_intro", key="$penguinlogistics_loop", volume=0.8, crossfade=1.5)]
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   How about you? You just passed straight through the center of an active Art, it's pretty wild in there.
[name="Mostima"]   Pfft, I just noticed, why did you cut your hair short?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Did you just laugh at me?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Our heads are full of sand. Even short hair needs tender love and care.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   I'm fine. Thank you.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Thank you? It's like we're strangers now.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Or it's like I know basic manners.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Heh. Yeah, I guess that's true.
[name="Mostima"]   Maybe if you weren't always sleeping during work, playing rock music outside the church, getting the Notarial Hall to chase you three blocks,
[name="Mostima"]   until your old school you accidentally blew up unfurls a big banner the day you leave Laterano, "Good luck in Lungmen, Exusiai!"
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Oh? Are we up to the part of our reunion where we pick away at old scars? Okay, my turn.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   By all means.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   ...Nope. Come to think of it, I don't actually know any dirt on you!
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Good girls shouldn't know too much.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   You playing my big sister now?!
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Yeah, pretty much.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2")]
[name="Bison"]   ......
[name="Bison"]   (These two seem to get along well. Is it because they're both from Laterano?)
[name="Bison"]   (And someone can actually talk over Exusiai...)
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Um... Mostima. I've got a little question I need to ask. A teensy weensy tiny little question.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Yes?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Why did you come back now?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Oh, well, lots of reasons. How can I explain it.
[name="Mostima"]   First, for work.
[name="Mostima"]   Second, Sauin means lots of sales in Lungmen. Things get pretty exciting.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   ...all those Sauins we had no idea where you were, you decide to come back this year?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Let's get to what you're really asking.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   *Sigh*... if you know what it is then just tell me already.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Heh. It's nice to see you all twisted up at a loss for words. Brings back memories.
[name="Mostima"]   And it's probably not right to get into all this stuff in front of our guest.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1")]
[name="Bison"]   Oh... Don't worry about me. I'll hang back here. You two can say what you need to.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2")]
[name="Mostima"]   That's no good. There's still a chance we're being followed.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Hey! Don't use Bison as an excuse, you crafty witch!
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   We should meet up with Texas and the girls first. Who knows how many scary mobsters have eyes on us now.
[name="Mostima"]   Are you always getting into this much trouble when I'm not around?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   I wouldn't say always. Maybe four days a week? Four or five? Or six or seven or eight?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   ...Right. Definitely not always.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   What about you? Where did you go?
[name="Exusiai"]   You know, when I saw the boss back there, he told me you already left Lungmen. You know how that made me feel?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   All kinds of places. Too many to name.
[name="Mostima"]   Down to a tiny village nobody's ever heard of to pick up a letter and then go hiking through a mountain range to chase after a nomadic city. That kind of thing.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Sounds lonely.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   But maybe my travelogue will sell well.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2")]
[name="Bison"]   Have you been to every country, Mostima?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Most of them. You jealous?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...a little. Most Messengers don't get to do things like that.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   You'll get a chance. But don't count on Penguin Logistics. We don't really use common sense.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Yeah, I'm well aware by now...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Sitting in a truck in the middle of the endless desert, staring at the setting sun through the yellow sand... It sounds romantic, but when that romance stretches into hundreds of hours, it starts to wear thin.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   I've never seen a yellow sand sunset, but don't you think it's pretty dusty out here today?
[name="Exusiai"]   Lungmen's air quality has really dropped in the past few years. They need to add some more air purifiers!
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Air quality...? Maybe.
[name="Mostima"]   Exusiai, Bison, I hate to do this, but you two go on...
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_325_bison_1#2")]
[name="Bison & Exusiai"]   Again?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3")]
[name="Mostima"]   Come on. Don't you think I control my entrances and exits very well?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   ...Are you serious?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#6",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   It's just a few hours for you, but for me...
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Fine, Mostima! But you better buy me dinner! Really!
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   I know. I know.
[name="Mostima"]   Whew. What a night.

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Who's leaving her? Even if we didn't let her go, she would just disappear at some point.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   ...are you upset?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Aaaah! Let's go find Texas already! We'll talk about this another time!

[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#3",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]   Um, are we in trouble here?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#3",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   We're surrounded. An ambush right in the slums.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_201_moeshd#5",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]   Are these fellers with them mafia boys? They look different.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#2")]
[name="Sora"]   No, I recognize some faces. These are all local Lungmen people.

[Character(name="avg_npc_033")]
[name="Lungmenite?"]   I'm afraid we can't let you leave.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#4",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   I'm sorry?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Well, you're a Forte, and you've got a shield...

[name="Bison"]   Huh?
