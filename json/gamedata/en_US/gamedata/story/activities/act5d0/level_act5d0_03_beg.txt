[name="Bison"]   The shots are coming from above? Are they up on the overpass?
[name="Bison"]   How high is the angle of attack? Where could they be shooting from?
[name="Bison"]   Doesn't matter. First I've got to——!

[name="Bison"]   A Sauin candle? Real lucky these were here...
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1")]
[name="???"]   You got one stuck in your horn too.

[name="Bison"]   Huh? Oh, thanks. I guess I better yank it... out——!

[name="???"]   Don't move, candle boy.
[name="???"]   Quiet. Take cover behind that crate.

[name="Bison"]   Oh, okay...
[name="Bison"]   I appreciate your help, but you really don't wanna get mixed up in this. You better go somewhere safe.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="???"]   I'd love to. It's been a while since I had a trip to Lungmen. But a job's a job...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="???"]   Considering how I found you, I'm guessing your deal with Penguin Logistics isn't going so well?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...you could say that.
[name="Bison"]   Err, who are you, exactly? I get the feeling you're not a typical passer-by.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="???"]   Calm down. Let's just say I'm not your enemy.
[name="???"]   Whoops, they're coming back. Hide.

[Character(name="avg_npc_031",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso B"]   That Bison kid's all alone. This could be our big break.
[Character(name="avg_npc_031",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Mafioso A"]   Can we really just yoink him in the middle of downtown Lungmen?
[Character(name="avg_npc_031",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso B"]   Mr. Capone says as long as we do it nice and quiet-like, hold off on the guns and bombs, Lungmen won't make a fuss.
[name="Mafioso B"]   Nobody's gonna go looking in those filthy old alleyways, eh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_031",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_105_emper",name2="char_201_moeshd#4",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   And the bad guys are kinda hunting for him. You sure we shouldn't go get him?

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Can I really trust you?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="???"]   I guess I better introduce myself. I'm Mostima. A Messenger for Penguin Logistics.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   I think that makes me your colleague, for now. I usually work alone though.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...Mostima. I've heard that name from my father before.
[name="Bison"]   (Not to mention a Sankta with black horns... the rumors were true. Better not ask about them though...)
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Oh...? Good things I hope?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Erm... how should I say...? Just baseless rumors...
[name="Bison"]   And after you saved me like that, I have no reason to doubt you. Sorry.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Don't worry about it. You got nothing to apologize for.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Thanks... Now we should share our intelligence... although I'm still pretty confused.
[name="Bison"]   Basically, Penguin Logistics is in some kind of conflict with an arm of the Siracusan mafia.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Right. Got it.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Huh? You got it already?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   I don't need any more. You need to stop thinking so much. Trust your instincts. That's the Penguin Logistics way.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Oh. So the trick is to just stop thinking, huh...?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   They're a very special bunch. Common sense doesn't really work here.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...What about you, Mostima?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Are you always this direct with people?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   I- I think so.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   We need to get moving.
[name="Mostima"]   Follow me.

[name="Mostima"]   So that's where it was. It's been so many years since I've been back to Lungmen. All the signs are different.
[name="Mostima"]   Right... are you hungry? I'm trying to decide between matcha and chocolate.
