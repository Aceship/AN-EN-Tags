[name="Bison"]   We followed the directions all the way but why is... is that a block party?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8")]
[name="Exusiai"]   Check out that candle! It's huge!
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#8",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   Settle down, Exusiai.
[name="Texas"]   The air smells so sickly sweet, I feel like I want to puke.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#3")]
[name="Croissant"]   Mmm... we oughta get ourselves a booth here next time. I bet we'd make a bundle!
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]   Texas, have you heard from the boss?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Texas"]   Not yet. He's probably passed out drunk somewhere.
[name="Texas"]   Exusiai, can you get this thing off my head?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Why!
[name="Exusiai"]   Thanks to this stupid light on my head, I don't get to wear big fun party hats like that. I'm so jealous!
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]   What happens if you try to force a hat on?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#8",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   I get a feeling that's something like waking up hungover to find I'm in the passenger seat of a car driven by a very emotionally charged Texas.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#5")]
[name="Croissant"]   And that don't sound like a good time.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4",name2="char_103_angel_1#8",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]   So you've tried that before...
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3")]
[name="Exusiai"]   So where's the boss?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Bison"]   There's so many people here, if the enemy chases us this way, they'll get all mixed up with the civilians...
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1")]
[name="Fillet"]   Ah.
[Character(name="char_243_waaifu_1")]
[name="Waai Fu"]   It's Penguin Logistics.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   And you're... the girl from the detective agency...
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   And this guy here with you is that infamous knife-wielding helmsman from the docks?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   What? No. That's the craziest version I've heard yet...
[name="Fillet"]   I'm just a typical hawker. Oh! Tonight I'm a part-time finball master.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   And you must be Texas?
[name="Waai Fu"]   Something happened tonight. Don't act like you don't know.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   Waai Fu, you don't have to be so aggressive with them. They're just...
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   I know. But it's ridiculous how many times this has happened.
[name="Waai Fu"]   It's fine as long as you don't get anyone else mixed up in this.
[name="Waai Fu"]   But when it comes to getting innocent people hurt, causing so much damage to their property, can't you think like honest, law-abiding citizens for once?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#2")]
[name="Texas"]   ......
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2")]
[name="Bison"]   (Nothin' we can say to that.)
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   ...So what?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   So we must correct your deficient character.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]   Th- there's no need to come to blows here. We know we've made a lot of trouble for a lot of people tonight, but we can talk this out.
[stopmusic(time=2)]
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   Sure.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]   Texas?!
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#4",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   Let me say this first: everything that's happened tonight is completely baffling and inexplicable, and also completely exhausting.
[name="Texas"]   So let's just say I'm not in a great mood right now.
[name="Texas"]   You hear what I'm saying?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#4",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   One on one. If I win, you guys follow the rules to the letter.
[name="Waai Fu"]   ...for at least one month.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1")]
[name="Bison"]   (Just a month?!)
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   And if I win, then you and all your goldbricking busybodies have to mind your own damned business.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Fair's fair... But I won't go easy on you. Get ready!
