[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Bison"]   ...it's all their people out there.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_201_moeshd#3",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]   They got the back covered too. Looks like this feller's mighty thorough.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3")]
[name="Gambino"]   That coward Capone is too afraid of the Rat King and Wei Yenwu, even if that one might need a thought or two...
[name="Gambino"]   But you and the Rat King? You ain't worth a second look.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]

[name="Emperor"]   Croissant, grab me a bottle. Our friend here's got the broke brain. I'm gonna do him a favor and fix it up for him.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#4",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Croissant"]   But baws, not for nothin', we already smashed a couple million Lungmen dollars' worth of booze over here.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#4",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   ...and how much were their lives worth?

[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   Are we doing this?
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Nah. We're keeping the deal we made with Lil Wei. We don't go all out in Lungmen, we don't make trouble, we don't threaten life and limb. Keep it professional. Business is business.
[name="Emperor"]   But we been on the run for a grand total of five hours today. That's double my normal work day. Double!
[name="Emperor"]   Not to mention we torched a whole year's worth of goodies! Cars, booze, and my precious vinyl!
[name="Emperor"]   And now we got some tragic, unanticipated deaths here in my club. What're we gonna do about all this? Hm?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   Understood.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="avg_npc_028",focus=2)]
[name="Gambino"]   Texas. This name of yours displeases me.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="avg_npc_028",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   I don't recall knowing any Siracusans like you. But you're about to go running out of Lungmen with your tail between your legs.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="avg_npc_028#3",focus=2)]
[name="Gambino"]   You're gonna regret slandering my family, Texas.
[name="Gambino"]   Who here's the stray dog who ran off to Lungmen? You know the truth. You ain't fit to go toe to toe with a Sicilian.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#4",name2="avg_npc_028#3",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   ......
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#4",name2="avg_npc_028#3",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Hm. Does a small-time mafia dust-up really deserve such a grand response?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   No, it doesn't. But it makes for a nice excuse to tear myself away from troublesome social interactions.
[name="???"]   Croissant has ordered a new custom accessory for her hammer. Exusiai has sought my help in caring for her beloved gun. In short, there is much to be done.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Yeah, I might have something for you too.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   No matter. Assisting my colleagues with such trivialities is one of my duties, in addition to my primary function.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Can you look after this staff for me?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   This white one. You do understand its significance, don't you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Just for tonight. Let me relax a bit and enjoy the Carnival.
[name="Mostima"]   I can't exactly take it out onto the dance floor with me. I'll lose control.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   Of course. I will take it. It's my responsibility.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Heh. It always comes down to work, huh? Thanks anyway.
[name="Mostima"]   You want to go for a drink afterwards? It's on me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   I would love to. Socializing over drinks with colleagues is vastly more meaningful than the empty social niceties I've endured.
[name="???"]   But I'm afraid, looking at these movements, it may be a challenge to save The Ends of the Earth.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   ...So, did you just get in to Lungmen? How much do you know about what's gone on tonight?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   Everything. The threads that make up this year's Carnival are uncomplicated. The tapestry is abundantly clear to me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Are you not going to help?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   I am not. I will leave the physical labor to your youthful vigor, look after your items, enjoy a cup of tea, and wait for the situation to resolve itself.
[name="???"]   Right then. The Rat King is waiting for you. Do please enjoy yourself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   You too, Yith.
[name="Mostima"]   It's Sauin. It only comes once a year. Don't work yourself too hard.
[name="Mostima"]   Anyway, I'm out.

[name="Yith"]   Oh my. I was supposed to take off for Sauin.
[name="Yith"]   And here I am working overtime like always... what a dreadful waste.
[name="Yith"]   But at least, now that she's entrusted you to me, we can reminisce about the good old days, my old friend.
[name="Yith"]   Mm. It's nice to grip you in my hand like this. No complaining.
