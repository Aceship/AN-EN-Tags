[name="Croissant"]   Say baws, what year's this vintage?
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Hmm, maderized coloring, lively aroma, robust flavor, velvety texture, this is...
[name="Emperor"]   Last month. A forty of malt liquor from the corner store.
[Character(name="char_105_emper",name2="char_201_moeshd",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]   Perfect scores up and down, baws! That's why they call ya Lungmen's self-proclaimed number one sow-mel-eer!
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   *Pfft* How many times do I gotta tell you? This is a reserve weapon. It ain't for drinking! Sora!
[Character(name="char_105_emper",name2="char_101_sora_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Sora"]   Okay, okay, here's your mouthwash.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#2")]
[name="Croissant"]   Um... did ya mean to wash yer mouth with Yan huangjiu...?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   Alcohol is a disinfectant. There's industrial alcohol under the bar. That would do the trick.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd")]
[name="Croissant"]   S'all good. We got money so we might as well spend it. It's all in the process, y'know? Ain't the amount. It's the process of spending!
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8")]
[name="Exusiai"]   Everybody, the apple pie's ready! It's time to party!
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd")]
[name="Croissant"]   Oooh~ Exusiai's homemade apple pie!

[name="Sora"]   ...so like, what exactly are we partying for?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_101_sora_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Huh? It's Bison's welcome party.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_101_sora_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Sora"]   ...so like, where's Bison?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#6",name2="char_101_sora_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Um! I dunno!
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Then pick another reason. We always got a reason to party.

[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#4")]
[name="Croissant"]   Awright. Here's the guest of honor himself.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   Hey. Welcome to The Ends of the Earth.
[name="Emperor"]   You're late. That's three shots. Guest of honor drinks triple, but you can't drink. So that's nine sodas. Drink up.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Bison"]   Why is it called The Ends of the Earth?
[name="Bison"]   (And the decor is so gaudy... And what's with the penguin... is this some kind of punk thing...?)
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Don't just stand there with your tongue hanging out. This is your welcome party! Apple pie?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...No thanks.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Bison"]   So while me and Mostima were out there fighting off mobsters, you were in here partying?
[name="Bison"]   So... what happened to their leader?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   He got away.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   To be more precise, we let him get away.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Bison"]   Regardless, he got away... so what do we do next?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   We know the enemy's identity, their goal, and their numbers.
[name="Texas"]   They're the Siracusan Mafia, and they wanted to take Penguin Logistics's territory in Lungmen.
[name="Texas"]   ...even though we're a logistics firm and... never mind.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_101_sora_1",focus=2)]
[name="Sora"]   Don't sweat it, Texas. We've always got a few days here and there to take out the trash.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd")]
[name="Croissant"]   When ya say it like that, it makes us sound even less like a legitimate business, don't it?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7")]
[name="Exusiai"]   They don't know what they're talking about. They couldn't fill the boss's t-shirt for two minutes without cracking under the pressure.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Penguin Logistics is a unique operation. And I'm a step even more unique.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1")]
[name="Bison"]   But that means we have lots of options for how to work this out. Why do we have to fight with them?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Texas"]   I don't know.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   You don't know? How have you been...
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Alright, alright, let's not put too much brainpower into this. Find an opportunity to grab their boss, huck him in the river and boom, we're done.
[name="Emperor"]   This whole thing has been one big ass waste of time. I just. Don't. Give. A shit.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_103_angel_1",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Seriously. This isn't really worth spending any more time on. Here, gum.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_103_angel_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Om...
[name="Bison"]   But we at least need to come up with a plan to... Wait, what flavor is this gum?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_103_angel_1",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   White Horse Kohl flavor.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Texas"]   Croissant, please add this brand of gum to our hazardous materials list.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Croissant"]   We were runnin' low so I grabbed the new flavor. Didn't notice what it was. Oops.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Yo, are we gonna party or what? We got food, we got drinks, where's the tunes?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1")]
[name="Exusiai"]   I'm on it~!

[name="Bison"]   I wasn't expecting jazz... even if it's a little...
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8")]
[name="Exusiai"]   The previous owner was something of a jazz lover, but after the boss took over we had to make a few style changes.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#4")]
[name="Sora"]   A few?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   It's pretty much because the boss's own records all got toasted in that——
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Enough. Let's not bring back any tragic memories.
[name="Emperor"]   And besides, nobody asked him to go get sick. Here I am takin' time outta my busy schedule to look after his bar.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   is it Oripathy?
[name="Bison"]   Lungmen's been through a lot. They should've changed the way they look at the Infected...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   Nah.
[name="Emperor"]   He picked up an alcohol allergy.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ......
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#4")]
[name="Croissant"]   He was fixin' to be the greatest bartender in all Lungmen. Fer a feller like that, we call it terminal.
