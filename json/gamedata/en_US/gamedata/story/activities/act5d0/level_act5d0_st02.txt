[name="Waai Fu"]   Hey, you're doing the whole "triad face" thing again, you know?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   ...Welcome back. Did you look into those people for me?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   I came up with a rough sketch. As much as I'd like to bring these evildoers to justice, it looks like it's not going to be a one woman job.
[name="Waai Fu"]   I may have to ask for help at the office.
[name="Waai Fu"]   Seems they're not your run of the mill punks. And that Aak wasn't exactly forthcoming. He has to go and make everything so complicated...
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   I'm sorry, who?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Aak.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   Ah?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   ...His name is Aak.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   Oh... Okay, well, since it's not so simple,
[name="Fillet"]   I'll help out.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   ...You were listening, weren't you? A bunch of street thugs is one thing, but if we're dealing with a large-scale organized syndicate, we can't just go in there and start throwing punches.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1#4",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   We have other options besides going in there and starting to throw punches, don't we?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1#4",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Are you really going to nail me on semantics?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1#4",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   I'm not joking.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1#4",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   ...Is Uncle Tung okay?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   He wasn't hurt badly. But that's not the point.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Right. It's not. If this were just some underworld spat, I wouldn't get involved.
[name="Waai Fu"]   But when I see the wicked strike the innocent before my very eyes, I can't sit idly by and let them run amok.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1#3",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   ...Thanks. You've earned some finballs. On me.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1#3",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   I don't need finballs...
[name="Waai Fu"]   By the way,
[name="Waai Fu"]   This business tonight has something to do with Penguin Logistics. They're not even trying to cover up their involvement.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Fillet"]   They're good people. They probably just got mixed up in it somehow.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   They've gotten "mixed up in things somehow" dozens of times this year alone. They need to be a little more careful, and stop making trouble for everyone.
[name="Waai Fu"]   If we run into them, we'll have to give them a warning.

[name="Rat King"]   You have one.
[Character]
[name="Uncle Tung"]   I can't talk with the one called Wei. I've been dealing with him a long time. It would be very short-lived.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034")]
[name="Rat King"]   But you took a bullet for Wei Yenwu. It's why you can't walk straight anymore.
[Character]
[name="Uncle Tung"]   You think I don't know? Feh, I don't want to talk about this. It always makes me feel wretched.
[name="Uncle Tung"]   ...But at least Lungmen can walk straight. At least she's not wretched.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034")]
[name="Rat King"]   You're the same as you ever were. And I guess that's a good thing.
[name="Rat King"]   If you've really seen enough of him, then you better be on your way.
[name="Rat King"]   And even if he did see you, he probably wouldn't know what to say.
[Character]
[name="Uncle Tung"]   You finally let me go, Lin, this poor old wounded man.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034")]
[name="Rat King"]   ......
[name="Rat King"]   Mr. Tung.
[Character]
[name="Uncle Tung"]   What's that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_034")]
[name="Rat King"]   Live a while longer. Sell some more finballs.
[name="Rat King"]   Buy yourself a building, open a restaurant, take a few apprentices, and then maybe think about where to put your coffin. There's no rush.
[name="Rat King"]   The Rat King still lives. It's not your turn to die yet.
[Character]
[name="Uncle Tung"]   ...fine.
