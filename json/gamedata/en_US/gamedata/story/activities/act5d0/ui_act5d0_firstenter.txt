[name="Gambino"]   You win again. But you deal slower than I do with my toes.

[name="Capone"]   You backin' out again?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Shut up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Shut up? Wish you knew how to shut up last night. Coulda saved us a lotta trouble.

[name="Gambino"]   You been in Lungmen a long time, Capone. Maybe you need a reminder in how you talk to me, the boss.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Sit down, you moron. It's thanks to that temper of yours that business in Siracusa's so lousy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   You been here seven or eight years, and what've you done besides learn some Lungmen swearings? You stood here and watched our channels dry up?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   I'm the one who got us a supporter last night. Try as you did to cock it up.
[name="Capone"]   And besides, here in Lungmen, you and me are equals, "boss."
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   The way this Rat King runs the show here, ain't it just the old worn out Siracusan tricks?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   If only you could play a good Siracusan hand worth a damn.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Too bad you're the worst card in it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   We got a role to play in Lungmen. Think about it: we got a tired, broken down city with a rich underworld. It could be a new home for the Family.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Only Siracusa can truly respect us, Capone. Don't forget the shame of being driven out of our home with our tails between our legs.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   You can't eat honor.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Hmph.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Wei Yenwu set some rules for this city. As long as we don't break 'em, we can run our rackets here just like before. Lungmen needs a little "legitimate business."
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   ...I ain't seen you in years and I'm already gettin' sick of you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Same same, boss.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   You...!

[name="???"]   Can you not have your noisy lovers' quarrel in here? This lousy champagne's doin' enough to piss me off. Grab a bottle and take it outside, aight?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3")]
[name="Gambino"]   Get outta here. This don't concern you.
[Character]
[name="???"]   Watch your tone. I'm the boss in here.
[name="???"]   We got a one-stop funeral service, if you're interested. 20% off if you both die together.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Hey... ain't this guy...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3")]
[name="Gambino"]   ...This is what we get since we left Siracusa. Nobody knows you're Sicilian.
[Character]
[name="???"]   Who gives a shit who you are?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Yo, Capone, do me a favor and torch this tacky joint. Call it "urban beautification." Wei Yenwu'll thank us for tearin' down a tastelessly decorated rathole.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_027#4",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Quiet! Don't provoke him!
[Character]
[name="???"]   Oh?
