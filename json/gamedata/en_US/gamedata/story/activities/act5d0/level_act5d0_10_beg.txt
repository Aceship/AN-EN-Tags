[Character]
[name="Little Girl"]  Hehe, Uncle Ho gave this to me, Grandpa Rat! Uncle Ho said I'm small and I run fast, and if I got this to you quick enough he'd give me a yogurt. You have to tell him I did it!

[name="Rat King"]   Do you recall those Siracusans who came looking for us some time ago? The rest of their "Family" has since come to Lungmen.

[name="Seemingly Ordinary Resident"]   Should I contact our spy?

[name="Seemingly Ordinary Resident"]   What for?

[name="Rat King"]   To survive in Lungmen.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034",name2="avg_npc_033",focus=2)]
[name="Seemingly Ordinary Resident"]   But it's not like they need anyone's permission for that. They might as well take a meeting with a Catastrophe.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#9")]
[name="Rat King"]   If Catastrophes could speak, maybe we wouldn't need to fight each other.

[name="Capone"]   But you're the executive. That's why we're here to pay our respects.

[name="Rat King"]   Winning and losing are words that have no place in a business discussion. No wonder you had to flee Siracusa. You are no match for that woman.

[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   What do you mean?
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]
[name="Rat King"]   Penguin Logistics is on its face a legal entity. The only thing that can protect it is the ironclad law of Lungmen.
[name="Rat King"]   But they do, from time to time, cause offense to various stakeholders. And they never take it appropriately seriously.
[name="Rat King"]   But bear in mind, Sicilians, you must never overstep your bounds.
[name="Rat King"]   An unconventional order is not the same as disorder. Siracusans should understand this more than anyone. But you must never again bring trouble to these old bones of mine. Promise me that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]

[name="Rat King"]   The owner of Penguin Logistics has always acted so prideful, as if above everyone else. But Lungmen is changing. She cannot allow this to continue.
