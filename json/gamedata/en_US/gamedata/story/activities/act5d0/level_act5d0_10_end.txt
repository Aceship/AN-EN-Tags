[Character]
[name="Butler"]   Young Master, he was a threat.
[name="Butler"]   You should never have gone so close to him. He has an affinity for Originium Arts. I could not guarantee your safety.
[name="Butler"]   You must understand, the Young Master's safety is my number one priority.

[Character]
[name="Butler"]   Young Master, some things are not as they seem. You will come to understand in time. And I promise, the Master of the House had no intention of exploiting you at any time.
[name="Butler"]   And I believe Penguin Logistics will also be expecting an explanation. I must secure the Rat King's remains and confirm that he is deceased.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Texas"]   It's fine. The boss is gone. There's no one to hear you explain.
[Character]
[name="Butler"]   Thank you for your understanding. Now, Young Master, do take care.

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   It's his trap. Why would he want to give us clues? That doesn't make any sense.

[name="Bison"]   I don't know either, maybe we've been too quick to consider him an enemy...? I just have a feeling.
[name="Bison"]   It's not just a feeling. After we met the Rat King, he kept trying to hint at something... or something.
