[name="Gambino"]   But I can't keep playin' with you like this.
[name="Gambino"]   Real sorry about this, but you, your buddy, and that traitor, you all gotta die here.

[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_027#4",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Hah. We got the Family all split up, and the prey becomes the predator. We got a nice chaotic battle here each fallin' into each other's traps.
[name="Gambino"]   It's just like that time back in Siracusa... But this time, it's a gamble we got no choice but to win.

[Character(name="avg_npc_034",name2="avg_npc_028#2",focus=2)]
[name="Gambino"]   We got no trust between us at all. You really think I'd hand the Family over to some non-Sicilian freak?
[Character(name="avg_npc_034",name2="avg_npc_028#2",focus=1)]
[name="Rat King"]   Sicilian. While I have not once in my life set foot in a Siracusan city, I do know that you are unworthy of describing yourself as such.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034",name2="avg_npc_028#2",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_028#2",focus=1)]
[name="Rat King"]   The time for questions has passed, young man. And you have broken the rules far too many times.
[name="Rat King"]   Once was your transgression, another was yours. But it matters not. You have both overstepped your bounds.

[Character(name="avg_npc_034",name2="avg_npc_028#3",focus=2)]
[name="Gambino"]   Hmph. You really think you can take us?
[name="Gambino"]   You sit on a throne in a stinking sewer, telling desperate people who got no choice but to throw down their lives what to do. That's you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_028#3",focus=1)]
[name="Rat King"]   It behooves you, as head of your household, to broaden your horizons.
[name="Rat King"]   Compared to everything we have been through, your little Siracusan fiasco was a stubbed toe.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_028#3",focus=2)]
[name="Gambino"]   Shut up!
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#7",name2="avg_npc_028#3",focus=1)]
[name="Rat King"]   Have you ever seen a true onslaught? What it means to truly have barbarians at your gates?
[name="Rat King"]   When moving cities crash against one another, smoke chokes the skies, and the dying infected rot away by cesspools, crying in hopeless agony?
[name="Rat King"]   You know nothing. And yet you think to fight a city.
[Character(name="avg_npc_027#4")]
[name="Capone"]   (He's immensely powerful... him and that woman with him...)

[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_028#3",focus=1)]
[name="Rat King"]   Perhaps in your mind, this is the way for a warrior to behave. But for a leader, going too far is as bad as not going far enough.

[name="Rat King"]   I have no love of trickery. It's really no fun at all. What matters is what I said a few minutes ago: I truly do not wish to see family massacre family...
[name="Rat King"]   And yet you did harm to your own brother, right in front of me.
[name="Rat King"]   Now for this, I would not say you've crossed the ultimate line. So I will not kill you.
[name="Rat King"]   It's just that, since you disobeyed me, I'm afraid I have no need of such a crafty and conniving friend.

[name="Rat King"]   Heh... while you toyed around with the power over them, your underlings were mulling it all over for you. Truly remarkable.

[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_027#4",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   That's because I too am "Sicilian."
