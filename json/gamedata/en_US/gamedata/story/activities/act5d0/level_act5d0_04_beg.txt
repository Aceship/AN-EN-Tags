[name="Bison"]   By the way, you didn't happen to see a Sankta lady around here, did you?
[Character]
[name="Stranger"]   I didn't see anything. And I don't have time for this. These sweets are for the after party and are you gonna pay me if they turn up late... Oh?

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_101_sora_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Oh, really? I should probably give it back to...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_101_sora_1",focus=2)]
[name="Sora"]   And looking at your horns reminded me of something! They're just like the Mountain Dash Logistics logo!

[name="Sora"]   You familiar with the old expression "trick or treat"?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_101_sora_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   He was here just to make trouble, and today's not even... why would you have something like that?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_101_sora_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Sora"]   You may not be able to tell at first glance, but Lungmen's been through a lot lately.
[name="Sora"]   Sauin candles aren't bright enough to light up all the dark corners of this city, and those kids don't exactly have it easy.

[name="Exusiai"]   Oh we know you're not scared. Why else would you blow up all the boss's collectibles. A bomb in a candy box, though? That's kids' stuff.

[name="Exusiai"]   This guy sure is full of himself. Let's blast him.

[name="Texas"]   Patience, Exusiai. Let him talk.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#6",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   *Gasp*——Hah. Ain't you the least bit curious why Lungmen's lettin' us get away with all this?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Not really. As long as we go down to the station once a month to pay our property damage fines, they pretty much let us do whatever too.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   Gah...

[Character(name="avg_npc_031")]
[name="Mafioso"]   Just look at you broads...!
[name="Mafioso"]   We got the big man's OK to do whatever we want to Penguin Logistics, right from the real power in Lungmen. You know what that means, don't you?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   We're a legitimate logistics business? And a pretty good one at that?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#2",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   Then why do we always end up... You know what? Forget it.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   Who's "the big man" you're talking about?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   It sounds really pretentious. Super gross.

[Character(name="char_101_sora_1")]

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8")]
[name="Exusiai"]   Oh, Sora! What's up~
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#3")]
[name="Croissant"]   How about that. She wrangled Bison too.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1")]
[name="Sora"]   Hehe, I ran into this lost little calf on my way over, I thought I'd bring him along.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=1)]

[name="Exusiai"]   The boss went somewhere to do something.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Texas"]   You didn't run into anyone else, Sora?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_101_sora_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Sora"]   Hm? I don't... think... so.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_101_sora_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Huh? Do I have something on my face?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1")]
[name="Sora"]   N- no. Anyway, Bison filled me in on the whole story. Where do we go from here?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   First we get some more answers from our little buddy, then we formulate an appropriate... response.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#8",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Wait, Exusiai, do you mean...
[name="Bison"]   I actually ran into Mostima back there. But then I lost her.
[name="Bison"]   Erm, I mean, after we shook the mobsters, she——
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   ...don't worry about her. That's just how she is. Vanishing years at a time.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...years?
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#2")]
[name="Croissant"]   Tell ya the truth, I barely seen heads or tails of her since they hired me.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#5",name2="char_201_moeshd#2",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]   Ahaha, let's not get Exusiai too riled up...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   This is all very... unorthodox.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   She's a special kind of Messenger.
[name="Texas"]   Contractually, she works for the boss, but more often Laterano has her——
