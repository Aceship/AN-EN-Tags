......
...I always thought I was a pretty great Messenger.
I delivered packages, letters and such.
Sometimes they were sentimental, something they were valuable. Every once in a while, they were ruinous.
My father is an amazing man. He moved from Minos to Lungmen and founded Mountain Dash Logistics.
Profit, mutual interest, flattery.
These are complicated things, and kind of annoying to deal with, but I push myself.
My father once told me...
The other side of the world will be even more dazzling.

[Character(name="avg_npc_027#3")]
[name="Capone"]   Hello, MDL princeling.
[name="Capone"]   This is our chance to be formally introduced.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...You shot your own man?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Punishing traitors ain't against the rules in Lungmen.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   That's not what I meant... what are you going to do with me?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Make a trade.
[name="Capone"]   It's pretty simple. Gambino's tough guy act is gonna destroy the Family for the sake of some so-called glory.
[name="Capone"]   I don't want that. Lots of people don't want that. Who wants to die for no good reason?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   So what?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   So I'm gonna help you with Gambino.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   I don't trust you.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   ...And I can help you deal with Penguin Logistics.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ......
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   I ain't stupid. I been in Lungmen a long time. I made a lotta preparations.
[name="Capone"]   Your father's an important man who owns over seventy percent of the private Messenger business in Lungmen.
[name="Capone"]   And he's got some strategic cooperation with the highest levels of Lungmen's government.
[name="Capone"]   No matter which way you look at it, Penguin Logistics is the biggest obstacle to your business success.
[name="Capone"]   Our goal is to take over all channels of Penguin Logistics. Do us this favor, and we can talk business again.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   My father and Mr. Emperor have a very close relationship. I'm sorry, but you've played this all wrong.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   MDL is a very big company. Your father alone really has the final say?
[name="Capone"]   I think you're underestimating us. It's true the Family has been through some tough times...
[name="Capone"]   But in days gone by, our ancestors sat around the dark tables of Siracusa and proudly called themselves "Sicilian."
[name="Capone"]   Power shifts, blood's spilled, and I'm all ears.
[name="Capone"]   Honestly, what do the people around your dad think of Penguin Logistics? What about Lungmen?
[name="Capone"]   And what do you think?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...You sure talk about family a lot for a man who just killed his own kin.
[name="Bison"]   You think I'll take your deal?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   His death was purely... business.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Yeah. Who knows if you pay in cash or bombs.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   ...I'm sorry, I thought you'd be a little more mature. But here you're gonna throw your life away for some little thing that ain't got nothin' to do with you.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ——!
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   You're scared. You're supposed to be some big shot MDL executive, but you ain't nothin' but a spoiled little brat.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...Sorry. Young Minoans are famous for their boldness.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Looks like you ain't gonna change your mind.
[name="Capone"]   If you'd lived, you'd see a lot more of this kind of thing. Too bad this is the end of the road for you.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   (Grrr...! How is this rope so strong. I'm running out of time!)
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   If you die, MDL'll have no choice but to call in the LGD. Then they'll get mixed up and things'll get even crazier. Which is good for me.
[name="Capone"]   But now we're done talkin'. Say good night, little prince.

[name="Mostima"]   Um... do I have to answer that?
[name="Mostima"]   I'm just here looking for a lost package. Like a good Messenger would.
[Character(name="avg_npc_031",name2="avg_npc_031")]
[name="Mafioso"]   Mr. Capone, we got the place locked down. Everybody here's with you. She's on her own.

[name="Mafioso"]   Mr. Capone!
[Character(name="avg_npc_027")]
[name="Capone"]   If you wanna die, you're welcome to it.
[name="Capone"]   We do everything we gotta do to survive. Don't get it mixed up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_027",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   ...And you don't have to talk so spooky. I'm really just an ordinary Messenger.
[Character(name="avg_npc_027",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Capone"]   A Sankta with a horn says she's ordinary? Who's gonna believe that one?
[name="Capone"]   I got no reason to fight you. Do what you want.
[Character(name="avg_npc_027",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   A minute ago you were ready to go stone cold killer, now you're just letting me go?
[Character(name="avg_npc_027#3",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Capone"]   That's how the mafia works. It's got all kinds of little exceptions I don't much like.
[name="Capone"]   But if the princeling ain't gonna cooperate, and I can't kill him, I'll just have to find another way.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Bison"]   ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_027#2")]
[name="Capone"]   We'll be seeing each other again tonight. Maybe.

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Intercity networks are a lot more developed than they used to be. You should have a lot of chances to leave.

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Hm... If I had to choose, I'd say the biggest problem is the Catastrophes. If you run into one, then all of Terra turns against you.
[name="Mostima"]   There was this time that I left the Catastrophe Messenger's report at the transit station and I ran into one. I was a few hills away though.
[name="Mostima"]   The black clouds billowing around, the sky itself threatening you, it feels awful. Truly awful.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Catastrophes... if you're in a nomadic city, you shouldn't get hit.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   There's a lot of other problems.
[name="Mostima"]   Cities move to avoid Catastrophes, sure, but that means the place you're trying to get can end up crawling away from you. Imagine that.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]

[name="Mostima"]   Do you know the origin of Sauin?
[name="Bison"]   Where did that question come from? I heard it had something to do with ancient Sarkaz sacrificial practices...
[name="Mostima"]   Sauin in fact comes from some ancient Sarkaz sacrificial rites, and long ago, the meaning of the name was even more complicated.
[name="Mostima"]   Most holidays have something to do with sacrifice or worship. It's just that people have been forgetting for a very long time.
[name="Mostima"]   People welcome back the souls of the departed, soothe whatever lingering issues they may have with the living, and send them on back.
[name="Mostima"]   But nobody takes these things seriously anymore.
[name="Mostima"]   The living sing and dance and dress up as ghosts. But the actual dead lay here in the graveyard, totally forgotten. It's not good.
[name="Bison"]   When the pressures of life get to be too much, it's kind of natural to want to do something to soothe yourself and forget...
[name="Mostima"]   We've all been through a lot. A Catastrophe is the surest thing in the world, after all.
[name="Mostima"]   When you watch those mourners give their flowers and sweep their graves, doesn't it make you feel a little more peaceful?

[name="Old Man"]   Uncle Tung's doing well. Business is good. He brought an apprentice with him the last two days.
