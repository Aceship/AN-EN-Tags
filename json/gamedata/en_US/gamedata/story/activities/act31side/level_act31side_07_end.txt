He is immersed in his own battlefield.
The enemies he faces are unspeakable, his tongue rigid and dead inside his mouth.
The people he loved have already left, never to see the next spring.
He lifts his weapon high into the air. All he feels is that he has something he must protect.
But... what is it?
The sound of a flute slowly drifts in.

A billowing current of air sweeps up, the Tianshi's golden figure uplifting light and heat into a spatial distortion, incandescent white flames outlining the chasm in the wilderness.

A fowlbeast flies by.
In a domain not meant for fowlbeasts. In this place, the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the frost, the rain, the snow, the mountains, the rivers—none of it is meant to exist in the first place.
But, this particular fowlbeast picks up an ear of rice, flaps its wings, and tarries on the peak of a hill.

Its heart beats, and beats, as if something is about to burst out––
A gust of wind blows by, causing the saplings to wobble.
The rivers flow without cease, the water coursing.
The mountains and rivers rise, the earth and soil rumbling.
The trees plant their roots, their shadows swaying.
As if sensing something, the fowlbeast takes flight once more with the ear of rice in its mouth, two seeds of rice falling into the boundless paddies.
Swish, swoosh... swish, swoosh––
A pair of eyes open.
