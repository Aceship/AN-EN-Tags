A clump of soil begins to move.
A talpibeast pokes its head out of its burrow. That dim tunnel leads to distant lands, its miniature resident too a drifter from afar.
Once it looks upon the boundless field, rippling and rustling in the wind, it lets out a sorrowful screech and dives back into the deep, dark underground.
