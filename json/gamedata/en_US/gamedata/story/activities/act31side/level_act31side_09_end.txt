Who ever thought it'd snow like this?
The field's ridges have been covered with a thick layer of despair-inducing white. The bits of yellow dotting it are the heads of grain that were laboriously planted only a month prior.
How many plants would still be alive after ten days? One dares not think.

A musbeast stumbles around, barging into the silent field of wheat.
Even the sparse crops in front of it are an unexpected joy. It sniffs around carefully, calculating how much it needs to tide it over and how much would be left to take back to the cave to feed its kin.

Until a thick metal hoe crashes down on its spine.
Three more heads of wheat are gone.
The angry farmer snatches the beast that has been ruining the crops, so angry that he wants to skin it to make a meal. However, the carcass is so emaciated that it hardly weighs more than a few taels.
With a long sigh, the farmer digs a hole in the ground and buries the beast's body.
