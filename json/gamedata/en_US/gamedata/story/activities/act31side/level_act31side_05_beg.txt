[name="Ji"]Who stands to benefit when Yan goes to war? In whose interest would it be to banish the Sui?
[name="Ji"]Did you fail to consider these questions, Lord Zuo, or are you simply pretending that they don't exist?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4121_zuole_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Zuo Le"]Why should I take anything you say at face value...?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1236_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ji"]Naturally, you don't have to believe me. Let us settle another account.
[name="Ji"]Setting aside the fact that I am a lowly peddler, my brothers and sisters have for centuries kept a great many dangers from Great Yan.
[name="Ji"]Even when it comes to my 'unemployed' little sister, Yan cannot even fathom the amount of effort it would've taken to build its nomadic cities without her.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1236_1#3$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ji"]Of course, there's also the sister who has been standing guard here all this time.
[name="Ji"]When it comes to the symbiotic history of the Feranmuts and Yan, from beginning to end, my brothers and sisters have done nothing to harm you. All they've wanted is to live like ordinary people.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1236_1#4$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ji"]But now, they are about to lose their lives over some undeserved disaster... Tell me, Lord Zuo, how are we to settle this account?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4121_zuole_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Zuo Le"]...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4121_zuole_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Zuo Le"]Indeed, a number of you have made invaluable contributions to Yan, which the nation has never forgotten.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4121_zuole_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Zuo Le"]Yet now, there are some of you who choose to stand against Great Yan, threatening the lives of countless people.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1236_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ji"]Ah, were you not suggesting just now that your <i>Xians</i> had taken good care of Yan? Why then, at the first sign of hardship, do you turn against the <i>Xians?</i>
[name="Ji"]Where even are these <i>Xians?</i> From beginning to end, there have only been ordinary people.
[name="Ji"]Why not take a look at the ground beneath your own feet?

[name="He Sheng"]No, no... This is the grain that was harvested normally before. How did it become like this...?

The granary is filled with the rice that was harvested only a few days ago.
What should have been a golden mound of grain has now turned into a red-and-black mass.
