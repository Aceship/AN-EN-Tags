[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_791_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[name="Record Keeper"]I said you must be exhausted, working in the fields by day and practicing kung fu by night. I envy you, as a matter of fact.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4121_zuole_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Zuo Le"]...I'm sorry.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_791_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Record Keeper"]Even so, the Grandmaster allowed me to follow him, allowed someone who could not study kung fu to watch you do so.
[name="Record Keeper"]He didn't tell me what I was supposed to learn, only that I should pay attention to detail and accuracy. I recorded and studied according to his instructions.
[name="Record Keeper"]Then I began to realize that kung fu isn't just about moves. The Grandmaster's philosophies on the fist are also philosophies on life, and every action or lack thereof corresponds to the natural laws of wax and wane.
[name="Record Keeper"]This wisdom amazed me even further, focusing on the infinite mysteries of kung fu. Where do you even start?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4121_zuole_1#1$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_791_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Record Keeper"]Right. I later realized that it wasn't so complicated. Kung fu is just kung fu, no more, no less.

[name="Record Keeper"]The Grandmaster wrote in the <i>Book of Arms</i>, 'See the other through the self; remain upright and wait for the proper time.'
[name="Record Keeper"]What he means is that one must ensure that one's posture is upright and firm, then seek the opportunity for victory.
