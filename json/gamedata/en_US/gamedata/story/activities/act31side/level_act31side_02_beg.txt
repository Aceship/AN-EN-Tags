The scorching sun of the sixth month has turned the city into an oven. The occasional wind brings the pleasant scent of rice and warms the heart.
This year's opera is particularly popular. The space in front of the stage is filled with people, heads bobbing up and down as they stand on tip-toes, trying to get a better view while unconsciously humming along.
Zuo Le watches the stage from afar. The actors are dressed in fashions of the past, their motions theatrically exaggerated, belting out verses in a regional dialect that he does not fully understand.

Firecrackers like strings of red peppers are lit, exploding in joyful golden light and assaulting the eardrums.
The sound of firecrackers is soon replaced by engines rumbling, driving into the fields that stretch as far as the eye can see.
The fields are like golden cakes and farmers like frosting, starting on the edges and creating joyful tracks.
As tires leave their trails in the mud, the harvesters spew golden waves from their rears, tiny particles mixed with the occasional clump of grass and dirt.
