The cries of fowlbeasts waft through the window of the farmhouse along with the rays of the rising sun. A mother opens her sleepy eyes, the child in her arms tightly grasping at the hem of her clothes.
She lets out a sigh and sits up, thinking of the events of the previous day, as well as the cries of her frightened child throughout the night.
The young child rouses from his sleep when he notices his mother's departure. His nose twitches, and tears soon flow down his chubby cheeks. The father adroitly picks up the child and stands next to the window, patting his back and lulling him back to sleep.

'Hush, hush, there's no need to cry. Look out the window – there's nothing there at all.'
'Look at the flowers, and look at our fields. Everything's fine, so there's no need to cry...'
However, the child bawls even louder, even stretching his arm to point out the window. The mother and father follow his gesture and look outside, where they see a strange, pale beast standing at the farmland's edge.

The silent lumberjack picks up his axe, and a wisp of tattered red cloth floats by. He rubs that coarse gash, as if remembering something.
A pair of strong, calloused hands – not quite bleached, but with distinct joints, coalesces with blood and mud. The hands tied a strand of red silk to his arm, before they fell lifelessly to the ground.
Those hands once lifted a heavy weapon. They once stroked his face. They once held a crying child.
The hand's master has slightly darkened skin, and when she smiles, she reveals her white teeth and shallow dimples.
He stands before the woods along the riverbank. Among the tree trunks are tied strips of red silk, wooden placards engraved with blurry names dangling from them.

A gust of wind blows, the branches sway, and the wooden placards make crisp sounds.
