[name="Lava"]You mean it's <i>that</i> bad...?
[name="Lava"]I swear, this year is the last one.

[name="Nian"]Anything can be spun into a good story, that's what legends and strange tales are...
[name="Nian"]I gotta ask, li'l Lava.
[name="Nian"]What makes you so willing to humor me for so long?
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]The legendary weapon you promised. When are you going to give it to me?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#1$1")]
[name="Nian"]Sure enough, you're still after that...

[name="Nian"]Would you miss me, if I were to vanish one day without a trace? For good?
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]Nope.
[name="Lava"]If that day comes, no one will remember you.
[name="Lava"]The weapons, tools, cities, and those films you made will all vanish... you know that.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#7$1")]
[name="Nian"]You're right... I shouldn't be seeing you here either.
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#6$1")]
[name="Nian"]Yeah, you called it. The dumb stuff I waste time on again and again all amounts to nothing in the end. But I can't help it. I just wanna have some fun and leave some memories behind.
[name="Nian"]Leave something behind and have fun. That's enough for me.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#1$1")]
[name="Nian"]Thanks, li'l Lava. It was pretty fun making trouble with you at Rhodes Island.
