It was just like a dream.
She traversed a great, long journey, crossing mountains and ridges in the ice and snow, reaching an endless field of rice at the end of the road.
The rich stalks glimmered like gold. She did not know who had planted them here, or why they grew so prosperously.
How wonderful.
'Then, stay here.'
She hears a voice calling out to her.
No... No.
She remembers her unfinished business, and the place she must return to.
She picks up a stalk of rice.
