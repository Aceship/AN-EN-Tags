[name="Ji"]Ages are not very meaningful to my kind.
[name="Ji"]But if we must, I will be exactly fifty, come Xiaoshu.

[name="Elderly Merchant"]I can tell you are not quite the same as mere mortals... I envy your long life. Still, now that I consider it, such a long life would be full of hardship.
[name="Elderly Merchant"]No matter what you are, I am eighty-three. You have followed me for so long. It certainly wouldn't be a bad deal for you, if I called you my adopted son.

[name="Ji"]Indeed, I was fortunate to have met you and seen the boundless sights these lands have to offer.

[name="Elderly Merchant"]Fate brought us together. I have nothing much to give you. Aside from that worthless business, this one mantra is all I have.

[name="Ji"]All under Heaven live for profit, and die for profit.
[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
[name="Elderly Merchant"]I have been reciting this mantra from the day I began studying business, and it helped me triumph over many rivals.
[name="Elderly Merchant"]But if everything under Heaven could really be summed up with just the word 'profit', this might just be a rather boring place.
[name="Elderly Merchant"]I don't have much time left and can't walk much farther. If you truly have such a long life ahead of you, then go and see for me.
[name="Elderly Merchant"]Walk this great land. Go and see for me whether there is really some kind of 'great windfall' that profits all under Heaven.
[name="Elderly Merchant"]If you truly do find it...
