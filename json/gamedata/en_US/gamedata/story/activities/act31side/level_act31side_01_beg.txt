[name="Veteran Tumu Tianshi"]Three months. This project is no small thing, and every segment needs time to ensure there are no problems. Three months is already on the optimistic side.
[name="Veteran Tumu Tianshi"]'Twelve Pagodas and Five Cities' isn't just a poetic quote. You know how long the... 'prototype' has simmered in the minds of the Tianshis, from generation to generation.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1241_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Assistant Minister of Engineering"]Of course. The first step is always the hardest.
[name="Assistant Minister of Engineering"]Though I am but a humble paper-pusher, I've had the honor to study at the Tianshi Bureaus myself. My command of the Arts is a far cry from the masters in the room, of course, but I'm hardly content with sitting behind a desk and drinking tea while staring at my Tianshi apparatus.
[name="Assistant Minister of Engineering"]Three months. That was how long it took us up in the north, in heavy wind and snow.
[name="Assistant Minister of Engineering"]Think carefully and give me an answer. How long will it take to finish the assembly of the last two plates of Dahuang's core section?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1245_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Veteran Tumu Tianshi"]...
[name="Veteran Tumu Tianshi"]Maybe a little more than a month, given enough energy and supplies...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1241_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Assistant Minister of Engineering"]There's no need to worry about energy. I have already given instructions for the supplies. Your only concern is the project's progress.
[name="Assistant Minister of Engineering"]At such a distance, simply transporting supplies is a massive undertaking. Every day delayed represents a huge expenditure of money and resources.
[name="Assistant Minister of Engineering"]There is no place for complacency, for the sake of the people and the hard-earned taxes they pay.

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1241_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Assistant Minister Wan"]Dahuang's Wu Dou Zhou is one-of-a-kind. The five beans, Wu Dou, are red, black, mung, soy, and white.
[name="Assistant Minister Wan"]They complement each other, but it is the local rice that truly makes the Dahuang Wu Dou Porridge stand out.
[name="Assistant Minister Wan"]The wonderful fragrance and rich flavor of Dahuang rice elevate an ordinary bowl of porridge to the symbol of Dahuang's culinary culture.
[name="Assistant Minister Wan"]The five beans each have their own flavor, but it is the rice that makes or breaks the dish. Cooking it is, therefore, far more than just dumping the ingredients into a pot and lighting the stove.
[name="Assistant Minister Wan"]Heat control is the key. The five beans must not be allowed to usurp the rice at center stage, else it becomes just an ordinary bowl of grain porridge.
