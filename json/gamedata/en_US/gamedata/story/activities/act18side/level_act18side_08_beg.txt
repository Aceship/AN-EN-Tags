[name="Gertrude"]Even the Witch King's envoys had no choice but to speak softly when they approached the Strollo Spire, a far cry from their overbearing airs while on the ground.
[name="Gertrude"]That was the Lord of House Strollo, our Lehnsherr. A Kurfürst, and once the most revered of all houses.

It truly is an eye-opening piece of music – or, so it was at the beginning.
Just as the title implies, the music weaves a shattered illusion from the very beginning, making one's heart sink to the bottom of a valley as if dark clouds are blotting out the sun.
However, the tune changes almost immediately, the sonorous cello uplifting the flute's clarity with the piano behind them both to break through the layers of gloom, singing a paean to the joy of glimpsing the light of day.
O, Light!
This is the singular thought in everyone's head.
They immediately understand the 'Licht' in 'Licht und Schatten.'
They begin to look forward to the 'Schatten.'
However, a feeling of unease begins to set in to some members of the audience.
Because they see the expressions of suffering creeping across the faces of the three performers.

[name="Gertrude"]Of course. The amplifiers are nothing more than a small distraction.
[name="Gertrude"]With those amplifiers, all of the Afterglow would have been made to suffer.
[name="Gertrude"]With the amplifiers dismantled, the Afterglow is indeed spared, but the same cannot be said for those inside the concert hall.
[name="Gertrude"]The remodeling of the concert hall began after my research into the Voice of Mundane had progressed to its next phase.
[name="Gertrude"]Czerny is trying to use his own composition to draw the Voice of Mundane out of the boys––
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]But what I'm trying to do is much simpler. The moment they try to pull out the Voice, they will realize that nothing is in their control.
[name="Gertrude"]I have tampered with the melody and Resonanz of the Voice of Mundane. Anyone who tries to become the new vessel, regardless of who it might be, will have to endure turmoil and chaos a hundred times greater.
[name="Gertrude"]The Voice, unable to find a suitable vessel, will collapse into an all-consuming void within the concert hall built by the Witch King himself, swallowing everyone within.
[name="Gertrude"]Of course, I am a part of this performance, and I equally have no hope of escape.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#2$1")]

[name="Gertrude"]Killing me would be no different from killing the three men on that stage. All it'll do is bring about those deaths a little faster.

Czerny desperately wants to stop the performance.
But he cannot do it.
The moment he begins to reel in the Voice of Mundane, he feels a single strand of abnormality. But in that solitary moment, it is already too late.

The concert hall begins to absorb and reflect their performance like a massive Arts Unit.
Resonanz. True resonance.
He immediately realizes that Gertrude's alterations were far greater than just some simple amplifiers.
The concert hall itself has become a weapon.

He wanted to spend a bit more time walking around the Afterglow, taking in the sights of the vibrant district.
He wanted to perform on a few more instruments, for the first time experiencing the charm of music.
He wanted to apologize to Czerny, to tell him how much strength his music had brought him. He wanted Czerny to become his formal music teacher, should he be willing.
He wanted to spend more time with Kreide.
He didn't know what he wanted to do with that time. Maybe chat, maybe argue, maybe even fight? He didn't know what he wanted to do with the time, but he wanted a little more of it.
But had he never come to this city, had he never accepted Gertrude's invitation, none of this would have ever happened.
It is his shallowness that has caused things to deteriorate to this extent.

But hypothetically, if the past him had wanted to do this, it would've only been to lessen the weight of sin within his heart.
Now, however, he will say that it is not for atonement.
He shoots a glance at Czerny and at Kreide.
One, an eminent maestro. The other, his dear, new friend.
He thinks to himself, they deserve to live much more than he does.
What he does not realize is that the moment he opened himself up completely to the music, he was no longer able to hide his emotions.

His grandpa told him that his body was extremely special, something he gradually discovered himself.
The people around him would start to suffer, and those he treated with kindness would leave him in the end – so he started to distance himself from them.
But, he doesn't find it a terrible existence.

The juxtaposition of light and shadow is vividly reflected in the trio of flute, cello, and piano.
Finally, the piece approaches its coda with an ensemble of cello and piano.
Listeners strain their ears, expecting to hear the whispers of the cold night, the embrace of darkness, the call of the abyss.
But they are greeted only with a long, drawn-out sigh from the void.

Upon witnessing the metamorphosis taking place on stage, the people in the auditorium begin to flee.
Panicked screams follow one after another, and Hibiscus and Czerny's shouts can be heard among them. However, to Ebenholz's ears, everything is blurring into white noise. His eyes fixate only on the plaza outside the concert hall.
[name="Ebenholz"]You were planning to do this the entire time, weren't you?
[name="Kreide"]Perish the thought...
[name="Kreide"]I just... did it on a hunch.
[name="Ebenholz"]A hunch?! When I said you were being unusually easygoing today, it was all because of a hunch?!
[name="Kreide"]No, no... I truly am glad that I got to perform with you and Herr Czerny.
[name="Kreide"]This is the happiest I've been my entire life.
[name="Ebenholz"]Then why'd you go and pull a stunt like this?!
[name="Ebenholz"]There are still so many happy things waiting for you––
[name="Kreide"]But if I didn't, then either you or Herr Czerny would've done it, right?
[name="Ebenholz"]So that means it somehow falls upon you?!
[name="Ebenholz"]You've never had a single good day your entire life, whereas I'm the one who's had enough of living since a long time ago. It should've been me!
[name="Kreide"]Sorry, Ebenholz.
[name="Ebenholz"]Why are you apologizing... What do you have to be sorry for?!
[name="Kreide"]The way I look now... must be truly hideous, right?
[name="Kreide"]I've torn up the clothes you had made for me, haven't I? Those nice, expensive clothes...

Kreide is too weak to lift his head, but he can hear Ebenholz's sobbing.
