[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ardign")] These enemies aren't just hard hitters, they're dealing extra Arts damage too...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ardign")] And the excess energy here is seriously messing with me! It's slowing me down so bad I can't even heal myself!
[Tutorial(focusX=-270, focusY=270, focusWidth=140, focusHeight=140, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_melan", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
These energy restructuring devices on the battlefield, <@tu.kw>'Tubas,'</> can use the excess energy to form '<@tu.kw>Realigned Flux</>.' Standing in <@tu.kw>Realigned Flux</> can keep you from being disturbed, and it can counter enemies' special abilities.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ardign")] Huh? But the <@tu.kw>Realigned Flux</> isn't passing through here at all.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_adnach")] So long as an Operator is deployed in <@tu.kw>Realigned Flux</>, they can direct its flow, and extend it in the direction they were deployed.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_adnach")] Cardi, just hold on a little longer! I'll point the <@tu.kw>Realigned Flux</> to your position as soon as I can!
