[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ardign")] Weird. It's like something in front's blocking the Realigned Flux.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amgoat")] That's alright. It's the Realigned Flux charging a '<@tu.kw>Resonator</>' with energy.
[Tutorial(focusX=-100, focusY=-90, focusWidth=140, focusHeight=140, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amgoat")] \
Just put the <@tu.kw>Resonator</> in contact with Realigned Flux for a while, and you'll activate the Resonator.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amgoat")] Once Operators are deployed on <@tu.kw>active Resonators</>, they'll get a new Realigned Flux originating from their position, without any connection to a 'Tuba.'
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ardign")] Understood!
