[name="Czerny"]You're reacting a lot faster now, Ebenholz, but you're still getting carried away in your own passages as if you're trying to show off. In the end, you still need Kreide to accommodate you.
[Character(name="avg_4047_pianst_1#1$1")]
[name="Czerny"]You're not even familiar with the music yet, so what are you trying to show off for?

[name="Czerny"]And then there are those ornaments. You managed to hit them all, but it's making your breathing completely uneven. What's the point of that?
[Character(name="avg_4047_pianst_1#1$1")]
[name="Czerny"]Kreide, on the other hand, is more solid in comparison. His main problem is insufficient mastery, something that can be solved with more practice.
[Character(name="avg_4047_pianst_1#1$1")]
[name="Czerny"]But at the end of the day, 'Morgen und Abend' is a duet. It is impossible for one person to constantly be accommodating the other.
[Character(name="avg_4047_pianst_1#1$1")]
[name="Czerny"]In all honesty, I would prefer to strike 'Morgen und Abend.'
