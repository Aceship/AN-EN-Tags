[name="Hibiscus"]Kreide's condition is more or less stable. The reason he passed out most likely has to do with the poison.
[name="Hibiscus"]We've rescued a number of poisoning patients whose signs and symptoms largely match with Kreide's.

[name="Hibiscus"]But on the subject of Kreide's future... the Countess probably didn't lie. Overall, his condition is on the edge of critical.

[name="Hibiscus"]I... want to trust the two of you, I really do.
[name="Hibiscus"]But I need proof.
[name="Hibiscus"]Even if it's circumstantial evidence, I need some objective facts to show that the Voice of Mundane isn't baseless speculation, but a part of an imminent plot––

Ebenholz and Hibiscus trade glances.
