How... How old am I? Two? Three?
In the middle of a rundown building, I look around at my surroundings, bewildered.
The man who brought me here told me that both my father and mother had already been lynched. At the time, I didn't even understand what lynching and death meant.
He even told me that, from here on out, this would be my home. I was going to be part of a grand plan, and if luck was on my side, I could even become Leithanien's next ruler.
I don't get it. I don't get any of it at all.
The only thing I understood in my confusion was that I probably wouldn't ever get to go back to my room, where sunlight beamed in every morning.

That day, the lady who had been taking care of us disappeared.
Once she was gone, the men who brought us our meals but didn't stay with us started arguing with each other.
I didn't understand what they were arguing about. All I knew was that the lady who sang songs for us probably wasn't going to be back again.
If I remember correctly, this is how the song goes:
The Sky is blue and fine,
The Breeze lilts by in Song;
The River murmurs clear,
My Heart is filled with Hope.
I think there was more to the song, but she never sang that part to us.

The weather got cold, and then warm.
At first, those men would make a huge ruckus whenever someone disappeared.
They gradually complained less and less. Our meals got worse, too, but at least we were able to fill our stomachs, thanks to there being fewer mouths to feed.
Perhaps this is just how man is meant to be. Before you know it, they disappear.
And so did their things, too.
Like the cane that belonged to the old granny, the music box that belonged to a boy, the wand and Originium dice that belonged to an older man...
But there were also things that stayed with us, like the song that the girl liked to sing.
There was a boy who learned the song, and he liked humming it.

Then, after a year, or perhaps two... I really have no idea.
It was just me and the boy.
I'd start trembling in fear every time those men came to our room.
When he saw that, the boy would comfort me and tell me that everything was alright, before standing in front of them.
Then, as soon as they were gone, he would sing the song.
'My Heart is filled with Hope.'

We weren't stupid.
The man in the noble attire told us the same thing the few times before that, but none of the ones who left with him ever came back.
My legs trembled. I looked to the boy next to me. His lips were pale, too.
I didn't want to disappear, nor did I want him to disappear, but...
He noticed my gaze and turned to me, and spoke those words as his lips trembled:
'I'll do it.'
When I heard him say that, I couldn't keep myself upright anymore. My legs gave out, and I fell to the ground.

I lived alone in the empty room for two whole months.
Then, on a rainy night, they brought the boy back. His eyes were closed, and he bit his lips hard, but he was alive.
I thought it was a miracle, but mere days later, he was taken from the room again, never to be seen again. Just like the others.
He was still humming the song before he left.

A few days came and went, and it was finally my turn.
I followed those two. On our way, I saw many rooms that I had never seen before. There were all kinds of devices and equipment inside.
We arrived at a small room that was completely white inside.
The woman in the spire caster attire told me to lie down on the bed. She was wearing a white surgical mask and gloves and had a very strange feel to them.
She put a mask over my face, and that was the last thing I remember.

Nevertheless, as time went on, the pain slowly weakened. In the end, I would get bouts of intense pain that quickly subsided.
I waited for them to carry me outside like everybody else, but they didn't.
Not only that, they started to fawn on me, gave me more food, and let me run outside in the courtyard.
They started giving me lessons to teach me how to read, write, and most importantly, use Originium Arts.
Very solemnly, they gave me the wand and Originium dice that belonged to the old man and told me to cherish them, as they were a part of His Majesty's collection.
Thereafter, whenever I showed any aptitude for Arts, they would shower me with praise.
Of course, those days didn't last very long.

The next day, they were gone too.
They didn't take their own lives. Rather, it was because the Empresses' Voice they kept talking about were here.
When I sat in the empty room and listened to the screams outside, I couldn't help but feel a sense a joy.
After all, they all loved to talk about 'His Majesty's bloodline.'
And now what they feared the most, the destruction of this cursed bloodline, was finally about to happen.

Graf Urtica has forgotten how he found himself handcuffed to this chair. His frequent headaches serve as the only reminder that the Witch King's final melody yet lives in his head.
His regent, managing the Grafschaft, has told him with scorn that it is an artifact left behind by 'the one whose name we dare not speak', and that it is no longer separable from his body.
But he has no idea at all how he became one with that thing.
He remembers now.
