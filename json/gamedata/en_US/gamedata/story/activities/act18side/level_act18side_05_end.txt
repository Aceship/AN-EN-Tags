[name="Food Stall Owner"]It was either her father–– or her oldest brother... I can't really remember, but it wasn't actually her.
[name="Food Stall Owner"]Though the Graf at the time designated this area for the Infected, he didn't care whether the people in it lived or died. He even had all the industrial facilities torn down.
[name="Food Stall Owner"]Obviously, to have us fend for ourselves.
[name="Food Stall Owner"]So among the nobles, this place became known as 'the Afterglow,' and the concert hall also became the 'Afterglow Hall.'
[name="Food Stall Owner"]The name, 'Afterglow,' represented the idea that we wouldn't last long, just like the last rays of light in the evening.

[name="Food Stall Owner"]He had written a few pieces, but since he was an Infected, everything was published anonymously.
[name="Food Stall Owner"]His works were magnificent, even attracting attention from the fancy folk atop the spires. But once they saw that Herr Czerny was from the Afterglow, they quickly turned away and left.
[name="Food Stall Owner"]That was until he wrote 'Morgen und Abend.'
[name="Food Stall Owner"]Ursula would be more qualified to speak about 'Morgen und Abend' than me, so I'll turn the floor over to her.

[name="Hibiscus"]Ms. Ursula?
[character(name="avg_npc_489_1#1$1")]

[name="Ursula"]The one who taught piano to Mein Herr had a daughter, and she was good friends with him.

[name="Ursula"]The Gräfin then–– she was the very same Dame you mentioned.
[name="Ursula"]Still don't know why, by the Gräfin sought out Mein Herr.
[name="Ursula"]She became his sponsor, and also went 'long with all his ideas. She gave him her full backing, finally lettin' 'Morgen und Abend' carry the Czerny, and spread it all throughout the Afterglow.
[character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#4$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]I can't imagine that.

[character(name="avg_npc_489_1#2$1")]
[name="Ursula"]'Morgen und Abend' was so popular and beloved, the folk in the spires couldn't blind eye anymore. They had no choice, they had to acknowledge Mein Herr's talent.

[name="Hibiscus"]So then, Mr. Czerny began to cultivate people in the Afterglow who had musical talent?
[character(name="avg_npc_494_1#6$1")]
[name="Food Stall Owner"]That's right. Seeing as how we are in Leithanien, the one thing we aren't short on is musicians! I may not have any talent, but even I...
[character(name="avg_npc_489_1#1$1")]
[name="Ursula"]Oh stop it, you're just being humble.
[name="Ursula"]A few years ago you were still playin' the accordion while yodelin' about your pickled cabbage.

[name="Food Stall Owner"]Haha, back in my factory days, I had to gather everyone up for lunch. Way easier to use an accordion than to shout.
[character(name="avg_npc_489_1#1$1")]
[name="Ursula"]Anyway, once music became a part of the Afterglow, our worst days finally passed.
[name="Ursula"]Composin', performin', teachin', makin' instruments...
[name="Ursula"]Plenty of folk publish their compositions anonymously, and most performers can't leave the Afterglow. But still, the money it brought in gave the Afterglow a foot in the door.
[character(name="avg_npc_489_1#2$1")]
[name="Ursula"]But before long, Mein Herr got into some big fight with the Gräfin.
[character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#3$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]A big fight?
[character(name="avg_npc_489_1#2$1")]
