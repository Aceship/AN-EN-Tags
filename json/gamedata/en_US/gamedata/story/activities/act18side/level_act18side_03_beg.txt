[name="Czerny"]An argument? Did he think your clothes weren't fancy enough for the Cliffy Patio?

[name="Ebenholz"]The clerk said something about 'not being able to enter the store unless dressed appropriately,' but do you see anything wrong with Kreide's attire? They were purposely fault-finding because Kreide was wearing commoner's clothes!
[Character(name="avg_4047_pianst_1#1$1")]
[name="Czerny"]So you, a noble, have begun to fight for the commoners.
