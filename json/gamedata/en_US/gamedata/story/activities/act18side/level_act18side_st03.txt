Rhodes Island Operator Ebenholz presses the tip of his wand to the letter and sets it ablaze.
Not long after, the flames reach the passport, then the Count of Urtica's death certificate, and then Kreide's.
The smell of burning paper spreads across the deck.
Ebenholz picks up the cello next to him.
He thinks back to how his dear friend played the cello, closes his eyes, and begins to play a simple, lively melody.
When the Twin Empresses first took control, countless pieces of music singing their praises sprung up all over Leithanien. This, too, is one of those pieces.
Today, the second half of the song has long been forgotten. Only the first half is still sung by a small number of people, thanks to its uplifting melody and the lyrics openly express the singer's cheerful mood.
The sunset is glaringly bright.
