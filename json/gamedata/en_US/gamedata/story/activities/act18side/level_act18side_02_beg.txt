Hibiscus's mindless utterance stuns not just the two Infected into silence, but the entire crowd about them who gathered to see what the fuss was about.

[name="Suspicious Infected"] You'd... utter the Majesty's name just like that... You really are... all tied up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_498_1#1$1")]
[name="Drunken Infected"] That's it, she has to be! It's what the prophecy said! This devil's going to use Infected blood to blast us all with Arts!

[name="Suspicious Infected"] Prophecy? You mean the one His Majesty issued...
[Character(name="avg_npc_498_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_501_1#1$1")]
[name="Andante"](Whisper) It rings a faint bell, to be honest, but I never paid any attention to it...
[Character(name="avg_npc_501_1#1$1")]
[name="Andante"](Whisper) Not to mention His Majesty died long ago. And even if he were alive and well, he'd have no reason to leave any prophecies specifically in the Afterglow.

No matter the choice they've made, Hibiscus simply stands there, not choosing to fight, nor choosing to flee.
