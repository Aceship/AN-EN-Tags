The selections are quite unlike the applications, where crowds thronged the seats to watch. Save for a scant few staff, only Czerny and the entrants are present.
If yesterday's audience was present, the majority would be applauding this brief ensemble piece until their hands were raw.
But here and now, as the final lingering notes fall away, the look on Czerny's face is fearsome.

[name="Gertrude"]Two Voices of the Mundane need only come close enough in space in order for 'Resonanz' to occur, and this sonority will amplify both your Arts as it occurs. That is the basis of my plan.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]Beyond amplifying your Arts, Resonanz is its own kind of powerful energy, and *this* energy will be massively intensified when you two perform in ensemble.

[name="Gertrude"]It wasn't meant as the concert hall it is, synonymous with the Infected district. It was meant as a fortress of Arts, a nightmare to terrify His Majesty's enemies.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]I've overstepped my bounds in doing so, but I do require the Afterglow Hall aid me in conducting the Resonanz's energy, so we can ultimately eliminate the Voice of Mundane that dwells in your body.
