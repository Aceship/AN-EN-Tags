With Kreide at the epicenter, the tones of the cello spread out across the narrow streets and alleys of the Afterglow.
Wherever the cello's notes travel, the Originium slugs turn around one after another.
Those who had been surrounded think the crisis is over, that the poison-exhaling insects will soon retreat to the dark sewers under the guidance of the cello's tune.
But they are wrong.
Both where they can and cannot see, Originium slugs make their way towards Kreide.
