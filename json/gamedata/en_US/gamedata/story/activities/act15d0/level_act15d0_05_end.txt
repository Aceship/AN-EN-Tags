[Character(name="char_451_robin#3",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=2)]
[name="Jesselton"]A deal.
[name="Jesselton"]Of course, we can't forget to praise Mr. Anthony for his moves.
[name="Jesselton"]What he did was offer you the olive branch, but truth is whether you accepted or not, it wouldn't do him no harm.
[name="Jesselton"]Marvelous move. I gotta say, even I can't help but give it a gold star.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#3",name2="avg_npc_137#6",focus=2)]
[name="Jesselton"]It's a crying shame that he don't understand who you are.

[Character(name="char_451_robin#2",name2="avg_npc_137#5",focus=1)]
[name="Robin"]Can you get to the point?
[Character(name="char_451_robin#2",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=2)]
[name="Jesselton"]Miss Robin, do you still recall the name of that place your pop worked, back in his lively days?
[Character(name="char_451_robin#3",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=1)]
[name="Robin"]BlackCloud.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#3",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=2)]
[name="Jesselton"]Right on. BlackCloud Trade Corporation.
[name="Jesselton"]Your pop was the general manager there. But right when his business reached the shining peak, BlackCloud Trade suddenly went under.
[name="Jesselton"]After that, no matter how he tried, business never picked up again. Ever since, he kept tumbling. Started drinking. These days, he lies on a hospital bed waiting for his medical fees so he can get operated.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#6",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=1)]
[name="Robin"]......
[Character(name="char_451_robin#6",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=2)]
[name="Jesselton"]So, you know who bankrupted BlackCloud Trade?
[Character(name="char_451_robin#2",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=1)]
[name="Robin"]You don't mean...
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#6")]
[name="Jesselton"]Correct. Simon Co. themselves. The family name Mr. Anthony's so proud of? Simon one and the same.
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]Of course, I gotta prove I'm being genuine. So let me give you the whole picture.
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#6")]
[name="Jesselton"]The short story is, six years ago, the Simons and HydeBro fought over something.
[name="Jesselton"]Both sides wanted the other's half of the pie. Both sides were pretty even weights. Their tussling and bustling grew and grew, until the day someone drew blood.
[name="Jesselton"]In the end, it was HydeBro one step ahead, and the Simons were dust in the wind.
[name="Jesselton"]During the calamity, Smith Simon at the head of the family decided his only son, Anthony Simon, oughta be sent to to another city. 
[name="Jesselton"]And then, once he escaped to Ironforge City, poor little Anthony got captured.
[name="Jesselton"]Lucky thing is, in Ironforge City's state law, all criminals are tried in the state itself.
[name="Jesselton"]In other words, he was not sent back to Bunkerhill City for trial. Then, after that, state law said he'd be locked in their own Mansfield State Prison.
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]Now, I gotta say, I think Ol' Smith planned this well in advance, sending his son to Ironforge to be captured.
[name="Jesselton"]When all's said and done, Anthony's safe precisely because he's not in Bunkerhill City, where HydeBro rule the land.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#2",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=1)]
[name="Robin"]Does this have anything to do with my pop?
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]Course it does.
[name="Jesselton"]I just told you Simon were competitors of a kind with HydeBro. Even if they were a move behind, they'd still get a last word in while death was a-comin'.
[name="Jesselton"]And there among the gang they spat that last word at, why, that was your ol' man's company—BlackCloud Trade.
[name="Jesselton"]We can also assume, if the Simons were one step ahead of HydeBro instead, then Smith Simon would've had the marbles to far outstrip the Brothers all those years.
[name="Jesselton"]But just like the Simons went poof overnight, BlackCloud Trade took the Simons' death struggles square, and when the sun came up, they'd vanished.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#6",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=1)]
[name="Robin"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]Your pop, of course, wanted to make a comeback. But would his rivals give him the chance?
[name="Jesselton"]Not in a million years.
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#7")]
[name="Jesselton"]So Columbian business goes. Times it stinks more of blood than the battlefield.
[name="Jesselton"]And because of that, your pop's never been up on his feet since.
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]Now, so, I've gotta admit, it makes total sense why Mr. Anthony wants to get outta here and give HydeBro hell twice over.
[name="Jesselton"]But you, Miss Robin?
[name="Jesselton"]We can both assume for sure, if HydeBro never wiped out the Simons, then the Simons would've never taken down your pop's BlackCloud Trade with 'em.
[name="Jesselton"]We can also assume, if the Simons were one step ahead of HydeBro instead, then Smith Simon would've had ambitions to far outstrip the Brothers all those years.
[name="Jesselton"]He might've even been more peaceful in dealing with HydeBro's various underling firms.
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#7")]
[name="Jesselton"]But 'if' don't live anywhere.
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]Present reality is—the Simons have caused your ol' man's collapse.
[name="Jesselton"]And the guy you're killing, Anthony Simon, is that family's last man standing. Their sole survivor.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#6",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=1)]
[name="Robin"]I don't think it adds up like that.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#6",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=2)]
[name="Jesselton"]Sure! Of course, I'm not gonna tell you this is righteous, Miss Robin, this ain't no justice at all.
[name="Jesselton"]If tragedies can be weighed, then I must say, the debt HydeBro owes Mr. Anthony is far heavier than what Mr. Anthony owes you.
[name="Jesselton"]But does that mean your revenge has to wait its sweet turn until his is done?
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#7")]
[name="Jesselton"]Is your pain worth less than his?
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]That ain't right.
[name="Jesselton"]Pain's an equal mistress.
[name="Jesselton"]Think about all those miserable years your ol' man's gone through. You've got enough reason to put the big guy to death, don't you?
[Character(name="char_451_robin#6")]
[name="Robin"]I...
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]And we must consider something else too, Miss Robin.
[name="Jesselton"]Something even more practical.
[name="Jesselton"]The Simons are already ruined. Even if Mr. Anthony can break his way out, even if he promises to sweeten your pop, even if at the very end he succeeds—
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#6")]
[name="Jesselton"]What the hell is he able to give you?
[name="Jesselton"]Can he pay all those urgent medical fees for you?
[name="Jesselton"]Can he get your pop to the most cutting-edge hospital out there for treatment?
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]Maybe ol' Smith passed his business brain down to his son, but in the short-term, he can't do squat.
[name="Jesselton"]But me, I can give you these things.
[name="Jesselton"]You can think it over, Miss Robin.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#2")]
[name="Robin"]!
[name="Robin"]You're...

[name="Jesselton"]I sympathize with your experiences, but I have figured out how you tick. I know you aren't willing to take charity, and I don't like giving others charity either.
[name="Jesselton"]So I've prepared for you a deal.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#3",name2="avg_npc_137#9",focus=1)]
[name="Robin"]Why would you tell me all that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#7")]
[name="Jesselton"]Of course, I was not planning to reach out to you at first. Only, this move Mr. Anthony made has forced me out.
[name="Jesselton"]Forgive my sorrows once more, but after living in here, even I was one step away from Mr. Anthony's boldness winning me over.
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]And if I hadn't told you any of this, you would've let that cheap sympathy go to your head, and you would've chosen to help him.
[name="Jesselton"]And if I were running some basic con on you today—say, Mr. Anthony brought your ol' man's company down—I'd worry about you hearing the full picture from his side soon enough.
[name="Jesselton"]And wouldn't I look like a cheat and a scoundrel then? You'd want nothing to do with me.
[name="Jesselton"]So I may as well tell you everything you oughta know. Let you choose for yourself.
[name="Jesselton"]Go and put all those past disputes to one side. Just think about this one, simple question—
[name="Jesselton"]You gonna choose to help him out of sympathy with likely no returns, or are you gonna help me for all I've promised in your interest?
