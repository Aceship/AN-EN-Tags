[name="Jesselton"]Beautiful. Beautiful indeed.
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#9")]
[name="Jesselton"]What a beautiful resolve, Ms. Robin.
[name="Jesselton"]I suppose you've made your decision. You want to turn your back on our agreement because of that resolve.
[name="Jesselton"]Very well. Who am I to blame you for that? I should applaud you for making that decision, even.

[name="Jesselton"]That said, I still have to point out one thing.
[name="Jesselton"]When I said this path had no future, I didn't mean you won't have much of a future after your little jailbreak.
[name="Jesselton"]I mean it all ends right here and now.
[name="Jesselton"]There isn't a future where you make it out of this prison alive.
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#6")]
[name="Anthony"]I guess we'll have to see about that.

[name="Jesselton"]I appreciate your compliment, Ms. Kafka.

[name="Kafka"]You asshole, you've been lying to Robin from the start!
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#5")]
[name="Jesselton"]No, no, no. I just like to have more than one option.
[name="Jesselton"]Had Ms. Robin gone through with the deal and succeeded, it would've saved me quite a bit of trouble.
[name="Jesselton"]And if she failed, as you can see, I've prepared a fall-back for her.
[name="Jesselton"]You can't say I planned for all this without putting myself in her shoes.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#2")]
[name="Kafka"]Easy for you to say, but you dragged her into this mess.
[Character(name="avg_npc_137#5")]
[name="Jesselton"]Haha, I never denied I wanted to see her struggle, did I?
[name="Jesselton"]However, Ms. Kafka, you are very much in the know yourself. Think about it. Do you think she could've raised enough money for her father's surgery, had I not dragged her into this mess?
[name="Jesselton"]I think it's extraordinarily unlikely.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#5")]
[name="Kafka"]Hmph.
