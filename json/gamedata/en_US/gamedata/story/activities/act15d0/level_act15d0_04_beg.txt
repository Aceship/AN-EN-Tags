[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4",name2="char_242_mayer#1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Director Muelsyse?

[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Up until Anthony started trusting Kafka to help him. She also told me some stuff about what went down between Control and Saria.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Did she now?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Want me to tell you?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#1",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]No. Not necessary for the time being.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#1",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]You look like you're doing terrible. Was it some bad crap Director Muelsyse told you about?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]No... though it was, in a sense.
[name="Silence"]I'm... I can't put it straight.
[name="Silence"]My mind is in disarray. I have some regrets. I feel as though I may have done something I am not equipped to do.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]You mean this whole breakout?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Yes.
[name="Silence"]I should apologize to you, Mayer.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]What for?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]I shouldn't have gotten you involved. I was too cowardly. I couldn't bear it, and I told you about all this. I made you assume responsibility with me.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#4",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Whoa, I don't really mind, y'know. The fact you could trust me makes me pretty freakin' happy, Silence.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]And I mean, really, all I've done is take a trip back to Columbia with you.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Actually, there's something I haven't told you.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]What is it?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Behind this incident, behind HydeBro, is the Energy Section.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Huh? Energy?!
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]You and the rest of Engineering are so closely tied with Energy, I'd been unsure whether I should tell you.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Oh... Hm, I'm fine, really. We're pretty tied up work-wise with Energy, yeah, but honestly, I'm not the world's biggest fan of their section.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#1",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Or more I'm, like, kinda terrified of Energy's director...
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]What's the Director of Energy like?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#1",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Nngh? Haven't met more than a few times, but sometimes he comes over to our end just to see. He'll drop in on our meetings, too.
[name="Mayer"]He opens his mouth and you go 'wow, he's a big, smart cookie,' but he gives off this kinda feeling like...
[name="Mayer"]I don't know how to capture it. He, like, cares more about what our stuff can be used to make, or what it can be exchanged for, things like that.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]I see...
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]And, like, since Saria took all the blame and resigned, it feels like us and the Energy Section got, like, even more tied up in each other.
[name="Mayer"]All these times some kinda weird work got scheduled and I couldn't even do any of my own crap.
[name="Mayer"]And that's why I wanted a chance to send myself off to Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#4",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Even if Closure's a little weird too, I'm way happier just doing my work at Rhodes.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]So that's it...
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#4",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Anyways, don't worry about me too much, Silence. In fact, I feel like you've done something good. Right?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3")]
[name="Silence"]Something good...

[name="Kal'tsit"]This intel and analysis you have provided is extremely valuable. It compels me to note your viewpoint strongly, Operator Silence.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5")]
[name="Silence"]In that case...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]But first of all, this intel's origins are clearly internal to Rhine Lab. Divulging internal intelligence to third parties without permission inspires me not to place trust in you.
[name="Kal'tsit"]However, from your behavior, I can trust you are in no way an imprudent person. Therefore, I require an explanation.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5")]
[name="Silence"]This is intel I arrived at through collection and analysis via my own personal channels. It has no direct relation to Rhine Lab.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]But your discovery of a matter like this should've prompted submission to internal channels, to be dealt with there. Rhodes Island has no capacity to adjudicate this incident.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4")]
[name="Silence"]No. I had no expectation that Rhodes Island would be able to.
[name="Silence"]I simply wanted to aid this person. I wanted to hear your viewpoint.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Why mine? Or should I say, why Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4")]
[name="Silence"]As of now, I trust Rhodes Island more than I do Rhine Lab.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]What of Rhine Lab are you skeptical about?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3")]
[name="Silence"]I don't know. I don't even know what it is I'm skeptical of.
[name="Silence"]But I've come to work here for a very long while, now. I've seen with my own eyes what Rhodes Island is doing. I, at the least, KNOW what Rhodes Island is doing.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]What you see may not be what you get, Operator Silence.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Moreover, it may be that you haven't noticed, but from your intel, it is very likely this Feline named Anthony was only immediately arrested the next state over as a setup by his father.
[name="Kal'tsit"]In all likelihood, a situation they'd arranged long beforehand.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4")]
[name="Silence"]But Anthony still hasn't been released to this day. He's already been stewing in that prison for six years. It's all the more likely he'll be in there forever.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Why are you placing such importance on a person who has nothing to do with you?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4")]
[name="Silence"]Because I want to see clearly, once and for all, just what kind of company the Rhine Lab I've served all this time is.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]......
[name="Kal'tsit"]You may be disappointed.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3")]
[name="Silence"]But it'll be far better than knowing nothing.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]You are greatly persuasive, Operator Silence.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Rhodes Island cannot provide you any outward assistance whatsoever, but I can, from a personal standpoint, provide you my viewpoint.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I hope you are able to maintain your notion from start to finish.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5")]
[name="Silence"]What notion?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]The notion that you are doing something good.

[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3",name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]Following what you said, I've been spendin' this whole time ascertainin' this prison's structure on the down-low. Already got a general grasp of it now.
[name="Mina"]Helps the prison turnkeys're lax, but structure's tight. I feel like gettin' out's a pretty tall order...
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#3", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]No problem, Boblem. There's always a way.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]How's about your end, then?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]I'm tapped in with Anthony. Turns out he had an idea for leaving in the first place, so we'll be following PLAN-A operations, helpin' him break out.
[name="Kafka"]We'll treat the clinic as our secret base from here on. I told Dr. Domma there about you. Just head right over, and you'll be good.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]So that's it...
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#2", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]What? You're a snap away from meeting the big guy who's been on your brain. Why d'ya look so flat?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]I'm not. I've seen him from far away a bunch of times. I feel like the big guy's kind of different to the one who saved my family once.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Huh, I see. What did he used to be like?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]He used to be... a little more, ermm... cool?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#2", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]That's a way to phrase it.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#2", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]Once after I learned he saved 'em all, I went to see him all secret. He was plenty more cheery 'n' open than he is now.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#2", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]What way? Was he that kinda big, splashy guy? The kid with like ten or so bodyguards fannin' from his heels?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#2", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]No, no... um... he was like, a bit more... I'm not sure how you describe it...
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#2", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]I'm gonna say he was the rich kid then.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#2", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]Whatever, now he's really silent, I feel like, and he's never showin' emotion. It feels someways sad lookin' at him...
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#5", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]He got slammed in here for six years, after all. It'd do a number like that on even the cheeriest kid.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#5", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]I s'pose so...
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#3", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]So we just need to help him escape, and he'll be back to the way he was before, for sure.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]More or less, right? Eh, I'd pass on him becoming a rich kid again, though!
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]I think it'd be swell.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#5", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Okay, okay. You lost me now.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#5", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]If you wanna put it like that, you're losing me. You said you only came to help Anthony 'cause a friend trusted you to. Why would you go so far to help your Silence friend?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Because I think Silence is a good person.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]What kind of reason is that?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]Mmnnn... me and Silence know each other from one time she went out to do field work.
[name="Kafka"]Me, I was used to pretty grubby methods to do my stuff. So happened I bumped into her.
[name="Kafka"]Guess I made some pretty un-small trouble for her back then. I drove her an inch from giving up her business there.
[name="Kafka"]But things worked out. And in the end, I got to know her. Can't knock 'em until you knock 'em, right? Do they say that?
[name="Kafka"]Anyways, after that, she'd show me some work pretty often. Felt like she was hoping I'd do things proper like she did.
[Character(name="char_440_Pinecone")]
[name="Mina"]She sounds like a real good person.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]Sure as heck is. Always felt Silence saw this world a little too rosy, though.
[name="Kafka"]Turns out there's a lotta things people who think like her can't ever make headway on.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]Okay, maybe Silence is a little naive. But she's so smart. And she ain't stubborn. So I've always felt she's fine the way she is. I wanna be friends with her.
[name="Kafka"]I may have plenty of friends, but I only got one like Silence. I really cherish her, y'know.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]So that's why you went to prison to help her?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Eh. That's not all of it.
[name="Kafka"]Another part's I once heard about this prison. Definitely been curious about this place.
[name="Kafka"]Another 'nother part's... 'cause Silence kinda changed this time.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]You mean her gettin' you to help someone jailbreak?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Mmm. And she begged me to help her get all this corporate intel together. I picture how Silence used to be and it doesn't fit with her doing this kinda stuff.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]Hm... did somethin' happen to her, you think?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]I dunno... ever since she left Columbia and went to some shop called Rhodes Island, I never saw her again. Been stuck with pen-palling.
[name="Kafka"]Never really made clear why she left Columbia either... but, yeah, I guess something musta happened.
[name="Kafka"]In any case, Silence seems real dead-set on this, so I figure I'll help her out proper for once.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]Kafka. Hear me out. You might be a real good person yourself?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#2", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Eh? You're saying you saw me as some stinker?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#2", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]I seem to remember you good-Kafka-bad-Kafkain' me straight into prison with you, y'know...
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#3", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Ahah. Imagine if I asked a stranger outta nowhere 'hey, let's get locked up together.' Don't matter how I ask, they'd think I was going nuts, right. So I needed a little more of an approach, yannow?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#3", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]Yep. I cannot out-words you. Forget it.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]Heehee. No, but anyways, I just don't think this is really a 'good or bad' kinda thing.
[name="Kafka"]It's like how you're going all neck or nothing for the guy who once saved your family, but what you're actually doing is breaking him outta jail.
[name="Kafka"]If saying it's for a friend makes it kind for sure, then maybe more of my friends are good people than the ones who just put on the looks.
[name="Kafka"]But people who do bad stuff even though they have good intentions... how do you call them good people, huh?
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=2)]
[name="Mina"]Hm... I think you have a point.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#3", name2="char_440_Pinecone",focus=1)]
