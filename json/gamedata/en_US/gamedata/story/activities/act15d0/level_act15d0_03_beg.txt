[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Not at all.
[name="Silence"]Even I could tell that much. She had none of the air about her.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Looks like the material I had on her was correct. She really was a security worker. Her skills certainly should've invited trust.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]But this all smacks of a little weirdness to me...
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]What?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Why they hire her is my question... but that's not too important. Skip it for now.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]More importantly, it seems most of the assassins were like Robin in that they'd been hired solo.
[name="Muelsyse"]They had no idea if they had any competition, and no clue who their employer was.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]How many assassins did HydeBro hire, in the end?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3", name2="char_249_muesys_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Your guess is as good as mine.
[name="Muelsyse"]But just like I said before, the Bros paid big to get rid of Anthony. Money with their blood and sweat in it.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]How did the assassins get into the prison?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]I'm sure you looked into it beforehand, too—Mansfield State Prison was established jointly by a few of the state's municipal governments, and it stands alone.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Mm. The way I've seen it described, the founding intent of the prison was to serve its state breaking new ground. Development was rapid, but crime rates stayed high, and rampant.
[name="Silence"]So at the time, it was a half-abandoned industrial platform.
[name="Silence"]It was Randal, the current warden, who suggested establishing the prison to the city governments. All at once, they had a solution for what to do with the platform, and where to put inmates.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Any questions so far?

[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#1")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Isn't the answer pretty obvious, though?
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]The idea is the prison gets used as a lockbox to shove every “troublesome” person. And it's the people none of the cities want to bother with.
[name="Muelsyse"]Getting inside isn't the tough part.
[name="Muelsyse"]Ms. Kafka never told you how exactly she got in there, am I right?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3")]
[name="Silence"]......
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Of course, the prison is still a prison. Getting out is tough.
[name="Muelsyse"]Like I said, it only visits cities on the edge once every few months. The rest of the time, it stops in the barrens.
[name="Muelsyse"]A convict escapes out there, they're stuck in the endless barrens until they die.
[name="Muelsyse"]Here's the thing. Robin mentioned it. A mysterious person promised it. There was a way to get them out for sure.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#1")]
[name="Muelsyse"]So as long as they didn't slip up and get themselves killed in there, AND successfully ran the hit on Anthony, then they'd just need to wait for extraction.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4")]
[name="Silence"]But they sent in a lot of other assassins. Would HydeBro really be able to retrieve each and every one?
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#1")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Of course not.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Which is why I said none of them knew about the others.
[name="Muelsyse"]And once they were inside, even if they figured it out, there'd be no escape. Their only option would be to kill Anthony or die trying.
[name="Muelsyse"]It's a simple, effective method.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3")]
[name="Silence"]......
[name="Silence"]But I still don't understand—why?
[name="Silence"]Simon Co. had shut down. Its core members were all in prison. HydeBro never once touched them. Why move against Anthony alone, of all people?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Oh. Do I actually have to start from there?

[name="Muelsyse"]Alright, Ms. Silence, now I know you really didn't care much about this in the past.
[name="Muelsyse"]Buuut, maybe you pulled something so bold and brash—and succeeded—precisely because you didn't realize.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#4",focus=1)]

[name="Muelsyse"]Sorry, sorry, I'm not making fun of you here. In fact, you can take it as me complimenting you.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#1")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Right, as for your question, first of all, let me answer it with a question—
[name="Muelsyse"]Ms. Silence, have you ever thought about how if you wanted to dispose of Anthony in prison, assassins are actually one of the least efficient methods?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4")]
[name="Silence"]No.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Because there are much better ways. Buying off the jailers, maybe bribing the warden...
[name="Muelsyse"]But sending an assassin to dress up as a prisoner, get into prison and kill another prisoner... when you hear it out loud, it sounds dumb, doesn't it?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3")]
[name="Silence"]Because they... couldn't?
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Yep, because they couldn't.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Whoo, from the way you reacted to this prison's history just now, I'm gonna need to give you a walkthrough of this side from the top, Ms. Silence.

[name="Muelsyse"]Your query's totally reasonable, but truth is I don't have a clear-cut answer either.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]But we can work backwards—in conclusion, they didn't do that. And surely they tried it before. So the only possible answer is they failed.
[name="Muelsyse"]Personally, I think it's because the warden didn't want to get himself stuck between a rock and a hard place.
[name="Muelsyse"]Or perhaps Anthony's mistreatment could be bought, but Anthony also had a massive influence in the prison. If he died, you sure couldn't handle it like a typical prisoner death.
[name="Muelsyse"]A lot of people'd love Randal's position, and as far as I know, he's got major guile too. I don't think he'd take the risk.
[name="Muelsyse"]Someone like him? It's more likely he took HydeBro's money and just did nothing.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]I remember Anthony once saying he'd fled to Ironforge City before he was finally arrested...
[name="Silence"]Perhaps his father had some involvement in the affair?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Hmm. Yeah, that's possible as well.
[name="Muelsyse"]Ol' Smith used to be a fair household name in Bunkerhill City. Sending his son to prison for his protection wouldn't surprise me one bit.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]You said that HydeBro never touched Anthony's family. That's a faulty assumption.
[name="Muelsyse"]The only reason they're not dead is because they don't need to be.
[name="Muelsyse"]Maybe you just can't comprehend it, but in Columbia, death's far from the worst thing that could happen to a person.
[name="Muelsyse"]Moreover, after dealing with Simon Co., HydeBro had no competitors left. They obviously wouldn't ever let the Simon family turn their next page.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]They said as much, the Simons posed no more threat...
[name="Silence"]So once they discovered Anthony was in a prison they had no influence over, they decided Anthony was a threat?!
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Correct. As long as Anthony lives, they always face the risk of a comeback.
[name="Muelsyse"]So. HydeBro had a grip over their local lockup, but none at all on the prison a couple states over, Mansfield State Prison.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#2", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
