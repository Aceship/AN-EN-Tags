[name="Muelsyse"]Alright. Kafka went inside... four and a half months ago? The break happened four months ago, right while Mansfield State Prison was stopped over at San Sophie City.

[name="Muelsyse"]Four months to plot a jailbreak. Can't say that's short, but I can't say it's that long either.

[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#1")]
[name="Muelsyse"]You can use it! I thought this chat'd probably take ages, so I actually prepped a whole bunch of ingredients.
[name="Muelsyse"]Can you cook, Ms. Mayer?

[name="Muelsyse"]Wait, don't tell me you didn't plot this together?
[name="Silence"]No. I wouldn't tell her in the first place. She only came with me to procure equipment.
[name="Muelsyse"]So that's how it is. I see, 'cause Energy and Engineering walk pretty close. You wouldn't wanna sour her outlook.
[name="Muelsyse"]But given she wasn't your partner-in-crime, would you run that much risk telling her?
[name="Silence"]...I don't need you to remind me.
[name="Silence"]Set it aside. What I want to know is: During all of this, what was Energy's position like?
[name="Muelsyse"]They were backing HydeBro, but had nothing to do with the business itself.
[name="Muelsyse"]It was HydeBro who tapped Energy's resources to cook up their assassination plot.
[name="Silence"]I see, then.
[name="Muelsyse"]Alright. My turn to ask, then—
[name="Muelsyse"]As far as I know, Anthony's accomplices in the jailbreak included the prison's original mortician, Ms. Domma, but also a woman by the name of Robin.
[name="Muelsyse"]What bugs me about that is, by my intel, Robin should've been one of the assassins sent to take Anthony out.
[name="Muelsyse"]But going by your version of the events, you seem to have just one helper, and that's Ms. Kafka.
[name="Muelsyse"]Could it be Robin wasn't your doing?
[name="Silence"]...It appears you have no idea how the jailbreak went, Director Muelsyse.
[name="Muelsyse"]I said that already.
[name="Silence"]On top of that, you've gotten one thing wrong. I had no immediate knowledge that this assassination would take place.
[name="Muelsyse"]Whuh?
[name="Silence"]If I had any awareness of it beforehand, I wouldn't have had Kafka infiltrate the prison alone.
[name="Silence"]It was far too dangerous for her. And under those circumstances, what she could accomplish was very limited.
[name="Muelsyse"]Wait, you're not telling me you only got Anthony?! He's your only lead?!
[name="Silence"]I am. I only realized in the past half year that Anthony was not incarcerated in the same prison as the rest of his family. Following that, I arranged for Kafka to make her way in.
[name="Silence"]My thought process at the time was: If she could meet him and help him break out of jail, perfect. If she couldn't, then oh well.
[name="Muelsyse"]...And then you managed to bump straight into the whole assassination.
[name="Muelsyse"]Oh, the pieces are fitting... This makes so much actual sense.

[name="Muelsyse"]But you have the research you love, and you don't care about much else. So there's gotta be some reason you were forced to care about this.

[name="Silence"]...Remember, as far as I'm concerned, this assassination was completely unaccounted for. I didn't imagine HydeBro would do things that way.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5",name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Well. That goes to show you don't have a full grasp on Energy's MO.
[name="Muelsyse"]Anthony's a hidden danger. Imagine some entity that can't allow any hidden danger or uncontrollable elements. Imagine they find out they've left a little loose end...
[name="Muelsyse"]That's the end of the Bros.
[name="Muelsyse"]So they've spent a couple years weaving this hit together. Making it real. Burying an imprisoned Anthony six feet under.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3")]
[name="Silence"]...To cover up their evil, they cannot help but do more evil.
[name="Silence"]It makes me retch.

[name="Muelsyse"]But there are some things that can't be walked back, huh?
[name="Muelsyse"]Back to the assassin, by the way. If that woman, Robin, wasn't backed by you, then that only leaves one possibility.
[name="Muelsyse"]Robin's an assassin who went turncoat midway. Right?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4",name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Right.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4",name2="char_249_muesys_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]So, could I trouble you to switch angles? I'm a little curious about this assassin lady and her prisonly actions.
[name="Muelsyse"]Given she and Anthony escaped together, I'm sure you've verified her status and experiences yourself?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4")]
[name="Silence"]Robin... was, true enough, initially one assassin dispatched to the prison to take Anthony out.
[name="Silence"]Around the time Kafka recalled that clash between the prisoners, she hadn't been in there for too long.
