[name="Silence"]HydeBro. Former building materials juggernaut in Bunkerhill City. Once clashed head-to-head with the up-and-coming Simon Co.
[name="Mayer"]Eep. They were up-and-coming back then?
[name="Silence"]Yes. Simon Co. originally was in the logistics business. By all accounts, the call was made to move into building supplies at a board meeting.
[name="Silence"]The company was named after the family, and half of its top-floor employees were related to the CEO, Smith Simon.
[name="Silence"]Including the person at the heart of this affair—Anthony Simon, his one and only son.
[name="Silence"]The short story is, whether it was over or under the table, the two companies fought it out, and they fought hard. To the point of blood, some rumors even say.
[name="Silence"]And in the end, one can say Simon Co. lost. Ever since, HydeBro has enjoyed a very real monopoly on construction supply commerce in not just Bunkerhill, but surrounding cities as well.

[name="Muelsyse"]—where Anthony led a group that successfully escaped Mansfield, and then met up with you two, and made it out of Columbia.

[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Undoubtedly. I can't comprehend her sort of mentality, to say the least.
[name="Silence"]She sought out a carpenter named Mina to pose as staff when entering the prison, and she got sent in herself as a convict.

[name="Muelsyse"]Is Mina that one Liberi in your team?

[name="Silence"]She is.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]From the sound of it, she was a total third party. Why'd you yank her into this?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]I'm not too sure, either. All Kafka said was that Mina once had Anthony's aid, and so would be willing to go inside to help him.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5")]
[name="Silence"]The long and short of it is she accepted my request, and entered Mansfield State Prison...

[Character(name="avg_npc_133")]
[name="Infected Prisoner A"]You know well as me, this is a nomadic prison we're in.
[name="Infected Prisoner A"]Times are it visits cities for supplies, maybe takes on a few new inmates. Otherwise, it roams around the wilderness and nobody gives a hoot.
[name="Infected Prisoner A"]So in here, two and two can make fish. Only law is the jailers' law.
[Character(name="char_214_kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]I guess so.

[name="Infected Prisoner A"]Hey, sort of a bright side, though.
[name="Infected Prisoner A"]Outside, it's just us Infected what don't get treated human.
[name="Infected Prisoner A"]But once you're in here, you ain't treated human whoever you are. Bastards in A-Zone don't live any better than we do.

[name="Kafka"]A-Zone?
