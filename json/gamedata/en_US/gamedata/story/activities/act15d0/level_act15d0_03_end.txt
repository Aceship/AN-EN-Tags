[name="Anthony"]Well, then. My turn to ask the questions. You're apparently here to aid me. That means you know where my assassins came from, I suppose?
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Uhh... before that, I need to ask you something first.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Anthony"]Please do.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]You know what your family—or I guess your dad is the one Simon Co.'s named after—anyway, do you know exactly what happened there?
[name="Kafka"]As long as you do, I can explain things a lot simpler.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Anthony"]My father was detained on more than ten charges. I know the circumstances couldn't have been simple, but I've had no time to find out concretely.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Okay, you know, yeah. That's good enough for me. Um, Simon Co., uh... thanks to ille... il... whawazzit?
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Anthony"]Do you mean, 'illicit?'
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#3",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Yeah, that! Illicit, smuggling, of Originium, goods! Anyway, the company got shut down, and the core members all went to prison.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]So your whole family's serving in Bunkerhill City right now.

[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#6",name2="char_441_lotus_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Anthony"]...I’m alright.
[name="Anthony"]I prepared myself to hear this a long time ago.

[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Anthony"]Alright. Who sent them?
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]HydeBro.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Anthony"]HydeBro. So it was you.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Lemme just think. What did Silence say... Right, your family. The Simons. Were competing with them across some kind of line.
[name="Kafka"]You were camping 50% of the profits each over this. And there was plenty of friction. So they always wanted to just camp your share too.
[name="Kafka"]And then they did it. Pretty simple.
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#6")]
[name="Anthony"]...HydeBro.
[name="Anthony"]I heard my father mention that name often. I even visited their company as a guest once.
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#6",name2="char_441_lotus_1",focus=2)]
[name="Domma"]They did all of this over a bit of selfishness...
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#6",name2="char_441_lotus_1",focus=1)]
[name="Anthony"]I'd heard of similar events before. I just never expected it'd happen around me.
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#6",name2="char_441_lotus_1",focus=2)]
[name="Domma"]Anthony. Are you alright? Need me to use my Arts, settle your mind some?
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#5",name2="char_441_lotus_1",focus=1)]
[name="Anthony"]No, thank you, Domma.
[name="Anthony"]I told you, I prepared myself for this long ago. I didn't expect the reality to come so sudden, that's all.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Anthony"]I believe you, Miss Kafka. I think there's no reason you'd have to deceive me about this.
[name="Anthony"]Seeing how things are, those assassins ought to be from HydeBro. Why only come at this point?
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]That, I have no idea at all. But judging by my experience, that wasn't the last of them just now.
[name="Kafka"]They've sent a whole bunch of people in to take you out for sure, so, uh, we should probably call this the very beginning.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Anthony"]......
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Anthony"]How about you? I presume you're not here just to help fend these killers off for me, are you? What's your objective, Miss Kafka?
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#5",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Kafka"]Me? Mmm... it's kinda tough to explain fast, but let's say this: someone trusts me to help you break outta here.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4",name2="char_264_Mountain_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Anthony"]......
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]You do wanna get out and take revenge, right?
[name="Kafka"]You got a life sentence. And it's the kind without parole.
[name="Kafka"]If you wanna leave this place, then you've got one choice, and that's—jailbreak.
[name="Kafka"]And that's why I'm here to help.
[name="Kafka"]Obviously, if you don't wanna peace out and you're gonna stay here forever, it's not like I'm gonna force you to go.
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#3",name2="char_214_Kafka_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Domma"]Jailbreak... but no soul has ever made a clean escape from this prison.
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#3",name2="char_214_Kafka_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Kafka"]Eyy. Say that if you want. But you can't knock it till you try it, right?

[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]Hm? Yeah, sure have.
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#5")]
[name="Anthony"]Then you should have heard some things about me.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]Yup. They all say you're the most powerful prisoner, and the most free. Pretty much everyone thinks you're strong as heck.
[name="Kafka"]I think you're pretty strong too, right now. Staying calm in times like these.
[playMusic(intro="$loading_intro", key="$loading_loop", volume=0.4)]
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#5")]
[name="Anthony"]But fact is, that's not what's happening.
[name="Anthony"]Even with all this supposed 'charisma' I have, as a prisoner, I can't bend the jailers, let alone the warden. I should never have earned my current standing.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]Eh, that's true enough. But you earned it now, so hey.
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#5")]
[name="Anthony"]In reality, what I've earned is the turnkeys' favor.
[name="Anthony"]At least, what little I know is that the warden himself said it. He told them to be 'slightly nicer' with me.
[name="Anthony"]All these years, I've had suspicions. After I reached Ironforge City, I was arrested. Then I came to this prison. Did my father arrange for this from the start?
[name="Anthony"]Foreseeing something, and sending me here in advance.
[name="Anthony"]Such things have always spun in my mind.
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]Oh, Silence mentioned that too. She said it was just one possibility, though.
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#5")]
[name="Anthony"]Silence. Is that the name of your backer?
[Character(name="char_214_Kafka_1#4")]
[name="Kafka"]Uh... whelp, whatever. Yeah, it is.
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#5")]
[name="Anthony"]I'll be sure to thank this friend afterwards.
[name="Anthony"]Anyway, it's just one possibility as you say. If I want to know the reason for sure, I'll need to get out. This is something only I can shine a light on.
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#1")]
[name="Domma"]Anthony, is it really alright to tell her this?
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#5")]
[name="Anthony"]It's fine. I believe you for the moment, Miss Kafka. Thus, I'm willing to level with you.
[name="Anthony"]Even if you didn't show up—even if I'd long since gotten used to life in this prison—I've still yearned, incessantly, to leave here.
[name="Anthony"]I can obtain most of what I want in here. But not since the beginning have I found the faintest outline of how to get out.
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#6")]
[name="Anthony"]So in truth, I should be the one asking you, Miss Kafka.
[name="Anthony"]Please, help me break out.
