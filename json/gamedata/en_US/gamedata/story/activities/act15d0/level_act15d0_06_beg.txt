[name="Muelsyse"]Well, now I understand why you said that even though Robin joined the team, it wasn't that simple.
[name="Muelsyse"]Looks like Jesselton talked her over, and she joined Anthony's side as a spy.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Yes.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]And here I thought there wasn't gonna be any more surprises in the story.
[name="Muelsyse"]I didn't know that Robin'd been through all that. Not even the intel I read mentioned it.
[name="Muelsyse"]And Jesselton. I'd heard about him, but I didn't know he could be this difficult to deal with.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]You know about him?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Yeah.
[name="Muelsyse"]He's one of Parasol's ace hatchet men, and I heard that as long as you've got the money, he's more than willing to be your errand boy. He's HydeBro's top trump card for this whole kerfuffle.
[name="Muelsyse"]Known to have a dainty fine taste, but most people just think he's beyond repulsive.
[name="Muelsyse"]I thought he was just some normal hitman, but who knew he was such a thinker.
[name="Muelsyse"]I knew he was HydeBro's trump card, but I didn't expect him to make a snap decision like that.
[name="Muelsyse"]He made it seem like he gave her a choice, but she actually didn't have much of a choice.
[name="Muelsyse"]It's just exactly as he said, though. He had information on Robin's background that Anthony didn't have.
[name="Muelsyse"]What's more, he'd been watching Anthony the whole time without him knowing. It's no wonder he had the advantage.
[name="Muelsyse"]If I were in her shoes, faced with that kinda predicament, I would've picked his side too.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]ã€‚
[name="Silence"]You're right.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Oh, I thought you would disagree.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]I don't agree with the way he thinks, and I don't like him.
[name="Silence"]But, at the very least, I think what he said to Robin was at least more forthcoming than you trying to test me over and over.
[name="Silence"]How you talk like you know who I am makes you just as repulsive as my mentor, Director Muelsyse.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Looks like I went a little overboard. Guess I should apologize.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]To tell you the truth, even I feel the same way about him. He's kinda boring.
[name="Muelsyse"]It's not easy to find someone like Robin if you don't go out of your way. Someone who has a complicated relationship with Anthony.
[name="Muelsyse"]And to bait her into the game like that...
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Well, whatever. In any case, we have all the players in the jailbreak party by now, right?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Yes.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]We've got a pretty smooth informant, an assassin who's not half bad, a girl working part-time who gets to go anywhere she wants in the prison, a morgue doctor who's been there for ages, and an excellent leader...
[name="Muelsyse"]It's pretty well-rounded for a ragtag team.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Right, long story short, after all the groundwork was laid, they more or less moved on to a preparatory phase. It almost went without a hitch.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Did anything happen during that time?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Nothing other than the assassinations.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Oh, right, I almost forgot. The hit was still on, wasn't it?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Yes, but since the jailers had no way to handle it other than looking into all the prisoners, and the hitmen were only going after Anthony, they gave up on doing anything about it.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Aha, that's just like them.
[Character(name="char_242_mayer#2")]
[name="Mayer"]Oh, I just remembered something Robin told me.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]What is it?
[Character(name="char_242_mayer#2")]
[name="Mayer"]That thing about how they convinced Domma to leave with them!
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Huh? What's this about? I thought Domma was part of the team?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Oh, that's right. They didn't find out until later that even though Domma said she'd help Anthony break out of prison, she didn't intend to leave herself.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#5", name2="char_249_muesys_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Why is that?
[Character(name="char_242_mayer#2")]
[name="Mayer"]Because she hadn't ever been outside the prison.

[name="Robin"]How come? Don't tell me you actually like it here.
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#3", name2="char_451_robin#3",focus=1)]
[name="Domma"]No, I don't like it here. Not one bit.
[name="Domma"]The last morgue doctor took me in when the prison was docked. Far back as I'n remember, I only ever lived here. This is where I grew up.
[name="Domma"]The patronizin' jailers, the hate, the inmate violence. Their deaths, too. That's all I ever seen in my life.
[name="Domma"]I sometimes take a walk around outside when we pop into a city. I'n tell I don't belong there.
[name="Domma"]I'm... scared.
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#3", name2="char_451_robin#3",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#1")]
[name="Domma"]cause he's my only friend.
[Delay(time=1)]
[name="Domma"]It wasn't until Anthony got here that I knew there were people like him in the world.
[name="Domma"]He gets into scraps like the others, but he got some self-control.
[name="Domma"]He gets angry, but he don't let his anger make trouble for nobody.
[name="Domma"]He's always polite, downright fair to everyone.
[name="Domma"]He pushes books on me, and tells me what life's like on the outside.
[name="Domma"]When he first got here, he'd belly-ache 'bout how fate's unkind to him. I's already thinkin' of helpin' him get out back then.
[name="Domma"]But I don't know anything, and I wasn't being much of a help to him. So I didn't say nothin'.
[name="Domma"]Then he started gettin' calmer and calmer, 'n' everyone else started lookin' up to him. I's happy and a little sad at the same time.
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#3")]
[name="Domma"]Felt like he was missin' something.
[name="Domma"]sides, I always thought that he shouldn'ta been locked up in here. He shoulda had a better life.
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#4")]
[name="Domma"]That's why I's awful happy for him when he decided to leave after Kafka spilled the beans to him.
[name="Domma"]And just helpin' him get out is more'n I need.
[name="Domma"]Don't say nothin' to him, but I'm ready. If somethin' goes wrong somewhere, I'm more'n willin' to give my life just to see him out of here.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#6")]
[name="Robin"]This isn't right.
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#4", name2="char_451_robin#6",focus=1)]
[name="Domma"]Whassa matter, Robin? You don't look too good.
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#4", name2="char_451_robin#3",focus=2)]
[name="Robin"]Nothing.
[name="Robin"]I'm just thinking. You're really willing to go so far for him?
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#4", name2="char_451_robin#3",focus=1)]
[name="Domma"]Yeah.
[Character(name="char_441_lotus_1#4", name2="char_451_robin#6",focus=2)]
[name="Robin"]I don't think that's a good thing, though.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#6")]
[name="Robin"]You're right. Life on the outside's a lot more complicated than life in here.
[name="Robin"]It's not all sunshine and rainbows outside, either. There're probably more bad things out there than good.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#3")]
[name="Robin"]But I also think... it's a shame if you don't try to live all that just because you're scared.
[name="Robin"]You don't think Anthony belongs in prison.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#6")]
[name="Robin"]But I think someone kind-hearted as you doesn't belong here either.
[Character(name="char_451_robin#3")]
[name="Robin"]You deserve a better life.
