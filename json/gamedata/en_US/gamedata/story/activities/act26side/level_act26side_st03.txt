[name="Abbot"]Yes, I do...
[name="Abbot"]Every waking moment, I prayed that the people would be given their due, prayed that this little corner of Paradise would not slip through my fingers.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_923_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Abbot"]But I've waited for so long...
[name="Abbot"]Too long. So long that I began to doubt that the very existence of faith was simply a self-imposed conceit.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_925_1#11$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lemuen"]How does it feel?
[name="Lemuen"]Despair, fear, sorrow... what else? The feeling of...
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_923_1#10$1",focus="r")]
[name="Abbot"]Incredulity.
[name="Abbot"]How do we doubt something that exists in one's own mind?
[name="Abbot"]It means you've begun to doubt yourself... with terrible consequences, if one is unable to dispel the doubt.
[name="Abbot"]If even faith could be false, then how much of Stefano is real?

[name="Lemuen"]I wanted to understand. I tried to understand. But I overestimated myself.
[name="Lemuen"]We could never truly understand another. 'Understanding' remains precious, fleeting, even with the incredible power of empathy.

[name="Abbot"]......
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_925_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lemuen"]But having experienced so much, I have began to think that there are many emotions that can be communicated from one to another, and understood by most, even without the empathy.
[name="Lemuen"]At least, I can say that I have began to understand the thoughts of a certain individual, not because I sensed something, but because I have experienced it myself...
[name="Lemuen"]I offer this to you, Bishop Stefano.

The old man says no more.
Age has taken its toll on him, as have the ordeals of last night. The lines of age fill every gap on his face.
Before Lemuen's eyes, Stefano Torregrossa walks out the door, his back slightly hunched.

The aging Sankta's silhouette begins to fade into the morning sun as he slowly walks away.
As she sees him off, Lemuen gets a feeling.
The feeling that she has not seen the last of the old man.
As he said himself—
Perhaps he will find the Laterano that he is looking for.
