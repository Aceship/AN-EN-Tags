[name="Abbot"]I am Stefano Torregrossa, abbot of the Sanctilaminium Ambrosii.
[name="Abbot"]The words 'believer' and 'kin' are not used here.
[name="Abbot"]The mundane world has certain conceptions of the Sankta and the Sarkaz. Order and chaos. Peace and war. Angels and devils. We share the same conceptions.
[name="Abbot"]Our halos and horns are our most distinctive features, symbols etched in the very essence of our life. Our existence alone draws the attention of others.
[name="Abbot"]Yet we have seen the sun rise and set thousands of times together, and we gather here today to partake in communion, to share shelter and blessing.
[name="Abbot"]We have spent varying lengths of time here at the abbey, but even the newcomers amongst us have been here for more than a decade.
[name="Abbot"]For a much longer time, we had no way of knowing whether we had been abandoned or forgotten. We did not know what perils the path ahead would hold, that we would meet at a fork of which no one could know.

[name="Abbot"]We had conflicts. We had secrets. But we tried to accept one another.

[name="Abbot"]We fought beasts and bandits together. We built houses and paved roads together. We plowed fields and harvested them together.
[name="Abbot"]We were brothers and sisters. We loved each other, and treasured one another's peace and happiness as our own.
[name="Abbot"]The bonds that tie us went beyond any physical trait or telepathic connection, transcended any differences in faith or ideology.
[name="Abbot"]Yet, after having endured the long night, it was the fleeting cold before the dawn that overcame us.

[name="Abbot"]The nuncios from Laterano, the Executors, and... emissaries from a distant realm... they all had their own plans, brought new hope, and forced painful choices.
[name="Abbot"]We lost our battered pillars to fire, and our respected and trusted brothers to conflict...
[name="Abbot"]Stefano Torregrossa sought that which was most good, even if the answer was an unproven one. For this, I seek your forgiveness.
[name="Abbot"]Sanctilaminium Ambrosii is not Paradise. But it is our common home.
[name="Abbot"]I have faith that we will make the same choice.
