Lemuen movement is as light as her voice.
She pushes away the movement-aiding device beneath her. The lamp that hung on the handle sways in the night wind, falls, then shatters.
Light leaks out haphazardly, splashing on the silhouette slowly standing up in front.
The dark veil of night is lifted.

The cardinal aide narrows her eyes. The facade of meekness that built up from years of being bedridden falls apart in the sound of her gun being loaded.
