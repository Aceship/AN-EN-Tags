[name="Arturia"]In a place far, far away, there once was a village where the people led happy lives.
[name="Arturia"]Some built homes to shelter the others from the elements, some reclaimed farmland.
[name="Arturia"]Others set out to hunt, search for ores, and at the same time, fought back scoundrels who would take the village for themselves.
[name="Arturia"]No concept of ego existed among those villagers, no difference between self and other. No one could survive without the rest. They lived together in that small village, and called it home.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_490_1#10$1")]
[name="Arturia"]But, nothing good lasts forever. The soil yielded less and less, hunting become more and more difficult, and as food dwindled, stomachs grumbled in hunger.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_490_1#3$1")]
[name="Arturia"]Something had to be done about this! And so everyone said, 'this must be a trial given to us by the Lord, and we must pray for forgiveness!'
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_490_1#1$1")]
[name="Arturia"]Just at that time, a group of well-meaning people came by, and upon seeing the plight of the village, spoke to the head of the villagers:
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_490_1#2$1")]

This used to be a secret code agreed upon by several friends from school. So much time has passed that Lemuen thought she forgot, but the facts prove that she has not forgotten.

'Rescue successful.'

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4015_spuria_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Serpilia"]Switched to your business voice, huh? Alright then, Cardinal Aide Lemuen.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4015_spuria_1#12$1",focus="r")]
[name="Serpilia"]This mission was commissioned directly by His Holiness and is led by Federico, executor of the Notarial Hall. The other functionary is Richele Colombo, another executor who volunteered to come.
[name="Serpilia"]Our first objective is to locate you and Oren, and the second is to investigate this monastery.
[name="Serpilia"]Oh right, Federico also has another mission to maintain order. Unfortunately, I think His Holiness picked the wrong guy for the job this time.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4015_spuria_1#7$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_925_1#8$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_925_1#6$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_925_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lemuen"]The reason... Hmm. Let's just say that diplomacy isn't something that can be settled with guns and bullets alone.
[name="Lemuen"]When it comes to a shootout, the odds are always in my favor. But if I have to sit down for a negotiation, I need to tread carefully or I might end up persuaded by the other party.
[name="Lemuen"]It just so happens that I get along quite well with the residents here, so I want to see who ends up changing their mind first.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4015_spuria_1#10$1",focus="r")]
[name="Serpilia"]Oh? When you put it that way, it sounds like you plan on compromising.

[name="Lemuen"]Heehee. I thought it'd be a shame if you couldn't get your diploma for attendance reasons.

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_925_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lemuen"]I knew Oren would report the situation here, which is why I chose to stay behind. I've had a bad feeling about it, and I don't want to provoke the bishop any further...
[name="Lemuen"]With all the information I have on the monastery now, if there ever arises another opportunity to sit down at the negotiation table, I may be able to get him to relax a little and accept my proposal.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4015_spuria_1#1$1",focus="r")]
