When the elderly chat, the topic inevitably turns to Laterano
They call it bright, abundant, safe for all, disturbed by none.
They say it's true paradise on Terra.
The truth is, they all know the monastery's been adrift for decades, and only a dwindling few remain who've actually seen Laterano before. Perhaps two or three, or maybe just it's Bishop Stefano now.
They bring up Laterano, but the object of their nostalgia is a dream they're long overdue to wake from.
A dream where the sun shines and the flowers are underfoot forever.
Just as the monastery used to be, all those years ago.
