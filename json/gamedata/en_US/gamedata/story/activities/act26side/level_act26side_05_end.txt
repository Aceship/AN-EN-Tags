The battered wooden hut was a shelter in the storm for the young children.
Abandoned by adults who lacked the means to raised them, they wandered the wastelands and were picked up by a Sarkaz on death's door.
The battered hut was leaky and cold, but there were clean clothes, even if a little tattered, and food, even if the taste was not great.
The walls did a poor job of keeping the cold out. They could gather all the fabric in the house and wear the thickest winter clothes they had, and they would still shiver at night.
But it was home. Mamma was there.

The monster stands in place.
The path before it is blocked. It cannot go back to the past behind.
Justification, anger, pain, all consumed within the no-longer-human body, before it can manifest itself on the hardened hide.
Before an obstacle it cannot surmount, the monster loses the strength to fight, but cannot let go of its last bit of pride.
It stands, silent.
Like a statue.
