Clément covers his mouth with his hands, and tries to stifle the sound of his coughing as hard as he can.
But still the blood spills forth from his palms, with a discomforting viscosity, dripping down along the creases in his fingers.
He staggers backwards, and tumbles to the ground before the statue.
