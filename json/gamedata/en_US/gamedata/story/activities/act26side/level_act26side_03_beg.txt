The sensation is hard to describe.
There's a strange itch on her forehead. The halo atop her crown flickers with no rhyme or reason.
Her view begins, gradually, to dim.
Yes, Fortuna can see the wrinkled abbot's incredulous gaze, and hear the noise of the onlooking crowd.
But she attempts to feel the old man's mind, as she may have done every time before, and yet his emotions no longer drift their way into her soul, not even a hint or trace—
She cannot sense the other Sankta.
She is no longer one amongst them.
