[name="Eileen"]Look here, Holst!
[name="Eileen"]You've got to hand it to Clément. He really planted the flowers in front of the statue, prettier than anywhere else.
[name="Eileen"]I'm surprised Stefano was okay with it, digging a hole in the sacrarium floor, searching for the right dirt, all that.
[name="Gerald"]Take it easy. You're injured.
[name="Eileen"]It's just a little scratch.
[name="Gerald"]Even little scratches can get worse.
[name="Gerald"]And call me Gerald.
[name="Eileen"]Alright, alright. You're starting to nag like Stefano.
[name="Eileen"]That's why his face is all wrinkly. Don't end up like him.
[name="Eileen"]Worry less, meddle less. That's the key to a long life.
[name="Gerald"]Don't say that. Stefano wants the best for the abbey.
[name="Gerald"]It's thanks to him that we get to live here.
[name="Eileen"]I know, I'm just saying he worries too much.
[name="Eileen"]I'm afraid it'll become too much for him.
[name="Gerald"]Stefano is considered stubborn, even amongst the Sankta. He won't budge on what he thinks is right.
[name="Gerald"]But that's one of the reasons we've found refuge here.
[name="Gerald"]He says the Sarkaz are just like other people.
[name="Eileen"]And he's right.
[name="Eileen"]Well, you and I, we'll have his back if things become too much for him. We'll repay our debt.
[name="Eileen"]And stop thinking about what happened in the past. We turned our backs on Theresa when we left Kazdel. We can't go back, Gerald.
[name="Eileen"]Neither of us can.
[name="Gerald"]...I know.
[name="Gerald"]You don't need to remind me.
[name="Gerald"]I don't remember when I stopped believing in Her Highness's vision... I couldn't see the future of the Sarkaz in our two rulers.
[name="Eileen"]It's okay.
[name="Gerald"]I'm fine. We have a new life now.
[name="Gerald"]I led those who wanted to leave away from Kazdel. I'll take responsibility.
[name="Eileen"]Life is much better than it used to be.
[name="Gerald"]Be careful. We don't have the same resources we did before, and there are some tough customers among those bandits.
[name="Eileen"]Aren't you being a little too careful?
[name="Eileen"]How long will it take for the infamous mercenary to become a humble hunter out in the middle of nowhere? Five? Ten? Hahaha!
[name="Eileen"]Haha...
[name="Eileen"]...Gerald.
[name="Gerald"]Yes?
[name="Eileen"]Have you really thought about what you'll look like when you put down your weapons for real, and settle in as a humble hunter?
[name="Eileen"]What will I look like?
[name="Gerald"]No, I've never thought about it.
[name="Gerald"]What will I look like...?
[name="Gerald"]You'll see for yourself, Eileen.

A long time ago, Gerald used to look up at the night sky when he needed a breather after killing.
The sky is an oppressive black. The campfire has gone out, and even the embers have cooled.
Bloodied mercenaries wipe away the dirt from their faces, gazing at their equally battered comrades, briefly pondering questions they hardly have the luxury to think about.
Can Sarkaz like them truly hope for a happy life?
He once believed that the day would come when the Sarkaz rebuilt their home, but he feels more helpless with each passing day.
They have shed too much blood. They will run out of blood before their monarch's vision comes true.
Eventually, Gerald abandoned Kazdel, bringing along those gasping for breath, running from the land they once fought to the death for.
They hid from the world, ultimately finding a place that would take them. All they wanted was a normal, peaceful life.
The dream came true, once.
When did life turn bitter and oppressive?
It is like a fine dish on the table that no one has tasted.
It has gone bad through no one's doing.
If only blood can end this all...
Then there is only one thing left to do.

Federico Giallo stands alone in the morning light of the sacrarium.
The marks left behind by the flames have already been scrubbed away. Deprived of its furnishings, the sacrarium feels empty, with only the sound of footsteps to fill it.
Federico is an outstanding Executor. He has been with the Notarial Hall for six years, carrying out his duties with excellence.
But this is his first year as a saint. There is no one to guide him or instruct him.
The silent saint picks up the broken and burned flower.
The statue protected it from the flames. It was a miracle that it survived the fire.

Executor Federico realizes with a start—
Clément's expression was too calm.
He did not mention Gerald's death, nor the arrangements of the other Sarkaz.
What about himself?
Words without action have no power. That is why he did not say he would find out the truth.
Nor did he say he would fulfill Gerald's last request.
Federico gazes at the broken flower before his eyes.
He has a feeling—
A feeling that, someday, he will find the answer to all his questions in this flower.
