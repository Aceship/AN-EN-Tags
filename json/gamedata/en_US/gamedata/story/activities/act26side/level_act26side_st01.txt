[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_927_1#10$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fortuna"]It doesn't. Maybe it's a parts problem. And I don't know how to use a gun myself...
[name="Fortuna"]But I'm not carrying it to use it anyway.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_936_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Delfina"]I always thought it was a decorative accessory.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_927_1#10$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fortuna"]Partly.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_927_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Fortuna"]Holding the gun like this is like praying.
[name="Fortuna"]That's what Dad said when he gave it to me. He said it was a Sankta practice.

[name="Fortuna"]We can share, Fina.
[name="Fortuna"]I'll try to get it fixed, then we can use it together.

[name="Fortuna"]Now, let us pray.

[name="Federico"]Approach.
[name="Richele"]Roger. Er, should we do a quick briefing first?
[name="Federico"]Target building has been identified. It is a large mobile complex built jointly by Iberia and Laterano in 1011, official name Sanctilaminium Ambrosii.
[name="Federico"]Originally controlled by Iberia, it disappeared after straying from its route 61 years ago.
[name="Federico"]Laterano received a request for help from the abbey one month ago and sent two nuncios to investigate.
[name="Serpilia"]Straightforward enough up to this point.
[name="Serpilia"]So how did we end up losing contact with our nuncios and bringing in big guns like you two?
[name="Federico"]My mission is to discover the whereabouts of Cardinal Aide Lemuen and Legatus Oren Argiolas, and to guarantee their safety.
[name="Federico"]I am also to ensure that the abbey is able to function normally and avoid casualties.
[name="Richele"]So His Holiness wants you take it easy?
[name="Federico"]......
[name="Serpilia"]Well, I signed up for Lemuen. I couldn't care less what happens to Oren.
[name="Federico"]Your personal feelings are irrelevant.
[name="Federico"]Target status is unclear, and we are unable to determine if the inhabitants of the building are hostile.
[name="Richele"]What do we do, then? Infiltrate and investigate?
[name="Federico"]No.
[name="Federico"]I suggest we take the most direct path and finish this quickly.
[name="Federico"]If they are deceased, I will return their bones to Laterano.
