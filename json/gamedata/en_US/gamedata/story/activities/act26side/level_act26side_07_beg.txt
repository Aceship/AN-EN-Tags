She walks into the broken sacrarium, crushing the charred remains of plants to powder beneath her feet.
The arched roof of the sacrarium has collapsed in the fire, exposing the interior in the sunlight.
The wind has carried away the smell, but there is no one to clean up the rubble.
The marks of the fire will remain forever, unless the chapel is rebuilt.
