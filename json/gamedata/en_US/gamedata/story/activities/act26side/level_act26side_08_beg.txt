The elderly abbot lifts a porcelain tray, his hands quivering amidst string's overtones.
He appears as if wrestling with the sound that echoes throughout the dark, awaiting their end.
He was still young when the sounds of paradise arose in the abbey years and years ago, so young that his reflection in the fountain did not yet show a single hair of white.
Wild fowls were drawn to these roving soils, fluttering through skies rich with organ chords, flying for the square. In his old age, the last abbot handed the monastery down to him, Cleric Stefano, the youngest of them all.

Federico never gives more warning than needed. The gun in his hands simply serves the place of speech.
Clément has not collapsed.
The wasting man clutches at his arm, where all feeling is lost, and gives a bitter smile.

[name="Clément"]Why... won't you kill me?

[name="Federico"]Your actions have not directly led to the deaths of any Lateran citizens. The law would not sentence you to death.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_924_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="Clément"]The law... So many years I've lived here, hearkening to His Excellency's guidance, following your law.
[name="Clément"]I feel its bind in ordinary times... Yet in chaos, in the time we need it most, it disappears without a trace.
[name="Clément"]There was some point where the music of Seniora Arturia became all I could even hear.
[name="Clément"]Senior Federico, is it the law of Laterano that wants to save me... or is it you, yourself?
