The sound of knocking echoes through the hall.
The door creaks open, and the unusually bright rays of the moon pour in through the gap.
There is a figure standing in the moonlight.
[name="Clément"]......

[name="Clément"]I finally found you, Senior Federico.
[name="Clément"]I was asked to bring you this...
[name="Federico"]By whom? What is—
The rest of the sentence vanishes into the night.
The tall and thin figure approaches, his back to the moonlight, his head bowed.
It is as if all the light in the room had converged upon him, but the overly bright light also casts a dark, suffocating shadow.

Now, Federico sees what Clément is holding.
What he said he was asked to bring to Federico.
A dagger.
Old, but no less sharp for it, once hidden in the belt of a certain someone.
Next to the dagger...
There is a package wrapped in cloth that has been dyed a deep shade of red, from which some sort of liquid continues to drip.
What is it?
It is...
