[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Count is right. The weight of the future is for the younger generation to bear, whether they are ready for it or not.

[name="Heidi"]  Is Uncle Vincent actually...?

[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Victoria he protects may just be a remote corner of the countryside, but there is not an ounce of falsity to the peace he upholds.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Protecting your home—This is a truth that generations after generations of Victorian have worshipped.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Now go ask your father. He knows how to find me.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Perhaps we'll one day meet each other again somewhere.
