[name="Witte"]  Ah, old friend, are you feeling better now?
[name="Witte"]  No, no, you lie down, I'm just here to see you, I'll be leaving soon after. A burdenbeast's work is never done, and the one who saddled me was myself, to boot.
[name="Witte"]  What? No, of course. To you, I'm still the same young lad you know, not the Minister of Finance.
[name="Witte"]  What's the point in fiddling with ranks? We're all here giving our strength to Ursus's vast land, striving for the truly honorable future Our Majesty envisions.
[name="Witte"]  We're all His Majesty's people. The few who've forgotten it, still living in the violent past, will sooner or later become orphans of archaic convention.
[name="Witte"]  Sorry, it seems government business has built up some steam in me.
[name="Witte"]  Don't worry, I can see how my colleagues and fellow strivers are strong in spirit, and I can see how the rot in the rotten eats away at themselves. We will be victorious.
[name="Witte"]  Those loudmouth nobles in the Army... they and those woodworms will very soon be dust at His Majesty's feet, and we will sweep them out of His way.
[name="Witte"]  That's right.
[name="Witte"]  —The State Council is changing.
[name="Witte"]  We'll take everything Ursus, everything of His Majesty's back from those unthinking, undoing aristocrats' hands.
[name="Witte"]  We'll tear the olden days to shreds. Savage them. Profane them. We must open a new way for Ursus, old friend—I will do it. We all will do it. Even if it takes our whole lives.
[name="Witte"]  Ursus needs change.

[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  We are all living in compromise. Some would call it apathy, and some would say, I am simply reaping what I sowed.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Yes. The weather is warming. That gust of wind just now failed to chill me to the bone.

[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Of course you wouldn't tell me honestly... as to be expected. Let me take a guess...
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  The Minister of Finance? No, no-no-no... he and my affairs are entirely unrelated. He does not possess this kind of finesse to interfere in others' stations. If it were his idea... I would rather it his idea.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Well, then, was it some woodworm in the Army? Those old, timid, cowardly bastards... not them, not them either, they have simpler ways...

[Character(name="avg_npc_174", name2="char_003_kaltsn09_1", focus=1)]
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Was it His Majesty's idea? His Majesty wants an... arrogant fool like me to pay the price for his own stupid actions?
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Oh, I knew that evening was not but a nightmare...
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Do you know how it feels to be blind in both eyes? From that dark view I had long been used to, I felt some more warped thing, squirming... the otherly sensation of fear.
[Character(name="avg_npc_174", name2="char_003_kaltsn09_1", focus=2)]

[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Ah... they cannot bloom here?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  In this boundless winter, what did you plant?
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  When I was young... I took part in a war against Kazimierz. Have you fought a war before, Kal'tsit?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ......
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  War is wild and chaotic. Ten-some minutes past the first sound of gunfire, formation and battlefield had lost all meaning.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  A few knights wounded my leg, and bludgeoned my head. I tossed my helmet aside, and as if for my life, I crawled... crawled until I reached a flower field.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  In there I blacked out, and was later saved by reinforcements. In my giddy daze, I remembered what those flowers were like.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...Pine lilies.	
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Yes... after the war, I asked someone to bring back some seeds from the frontier. I hated their Kazimierz scientific name, and so called them by a completely new one.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  I like those flowers. My city regarded them as a symbol of the city itself. Ursus's soil... is more suited to raising them than Kazimierz's.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  My wife... cared for them, cared for them so well.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  But they... never broke through the soil.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Spring didn't come soon enough, Your Grace.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Ah... the earth of my beloved Ursus. Know it can nurture hopes of all kind.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It is irrigated, too, by the bodies of the poor and the Infected.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  I don't deny it has likely committed all manner of atrocity. Yet even so, the earth forgives all... ah, I feel tired...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That doesn't seem a very convincing excuse.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Excuse? No, young one... I never thought I'd earn any pardon, and I never wanted for one...
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Only—Only in life's final moments, do I think... I was able to realize... the meaning... it was all...
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Pine lilies...
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  I want... to see her again...
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Leave, now, young one.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  I feel... how warm, the sunlight, as if I... can, once... again, see...
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  Hahh...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Perhaps you never had the means to pardon yourself in your final moments.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  (Ursine) May yet Ursus forget you, Grand Duke.
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  (Ursine) ...Ursus... my...
[name="Grand Duke Vanya"]  ...motherland...
