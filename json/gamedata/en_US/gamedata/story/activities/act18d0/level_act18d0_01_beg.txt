[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  (Sargonian) Let's not get ahead of ourselves, I just wanted to have a chat with you two. With... er, Rhodes Island.

[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Oh? As simple as that?
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  But all I took was a few employees... now I'm a little skeptical.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Your goods might've had a small footprint, but they're not cheap. It doesn't seem 'Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals' is so profligate a company. Would you really be so willing to give them up?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#4", name2="char_379_sesa_1", focus=2)]

[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  A perspective bursting with humanity. But who'll step up to weigh them, then—decide their worth?

[name="Sesa"]  Huh! The fixer from the black market... wouldn't come here just to scare our new recruits, would he?
[name="Sesa"]  Rhodes Island and the Sargon black market are far from bosom friends. We only had to take this plunge after some of our drugs got jammed up in Columbia.
[name="Sesa"]  Oripathy waits for no-one, correct? That's all this is. There should be no conflict between us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#4", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I've heard of you before, the armaments tuner 'Bridge,' having worked for three different arms dealers in the past. A fine reputation. Oh, I believe you're called 'Sesa' now?

[name="Sesa"]  Really, you make too much of me.
[name="Sesa"]  Well, then, what gives you an interest in Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#4", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  During a routine probing of accounts, a completely watertight transaction came to light. You must know, not one sheaf of gold in the Reefsteep passes out of my notice.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#4", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  And?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#4", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  No, no cause for worry. You haven't exposed any leverage, and as I've already said, your transaction doesn't interest me. It's just the... signature, on this contract, that I mind.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Come. I have time to spare today. Tell me, what kind of place is Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals?

[Character(name="avg_npc_053", name2="avg_npc_054", focus=2)]

[name="Sarkaz Mercenary B"]  No, his ambush point is at least a kilometer out from the bazaar. It shouldn't have been that fast. Not unless whatever team this is knew the topography here like the backs of their hands... or maybe, they're just experienced enough to blow anyone off the sand.
