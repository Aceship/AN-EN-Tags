[name="Lillia"]  Six or seven. Maybe even more; we don't dare meet together in public. We might be caught, used for leverage.
[name="Lillia"]  That includes me. All lost things in that 'accident' they can never have back.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  When did you start plotting all of this?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  ......
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  From the moment I found out the Fourth Army's lackeys fired the first bolt in the Research Institute, mercilessly shredding the father of my children's throat. From that moment, I started.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2", name2="avg_npc_168_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Lillia...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Don't take me as a brave fool. Even if my health gives me so little time to work with you all... I've still accomplished one thing or another. Such as—
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You found the whereabouts of Grand Duke Vanya. The Pine Valley Retreat, situated beyond any nomadic city.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Oh...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And this former Fourth Army staff officer was also highly likely to be a Grand Duke of Ursus actualizing the Sarcophagus incident, perhaps right in the frailest, weakest position of his endlessly long campaign career.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You want to conduct an assassination, Lillia, but this act of vengeance can still be considered 'bravely foolish.'
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  ...Heh.
[name="Lillia"]  I can finally see why my husband... why that Astrov looked up to you so.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#3", name2="avg_npc_168_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But you must know, Lillia, assassinating an old Grand Duke will have no significance at all.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Maybe from the start, Vanya, the man so decrepit he needs cardiac stimulant injections when he gives speeches, was not the real murderer.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#3", name2="avg_npc_168_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  I know, Kal'tsit, I know...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#3", name2="avg_npc_168_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  But do you really think when I entrusted Louisa to someone else, it was just for a rational ending, a so-called fair trial? As if you can't guess, Kal'tsit.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Blind revenge will only cause you to lack foresight.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Kal'tsit, Kal'tsit. Perhaps you couldn't understand.
[name="Lillia"]  Louisa never even learned to say 'papa.'

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You can sit.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  How long have you spent in here?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Not worth mentioning. Lillia. You look awful. You need to rest.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  How did you find me?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Just sheer chance... if not for sheer chance, perhaps I'd have never learned you were still alive.
[name="Lillia"]  Lyudmila.
[name="Lillia"]  We didn't want our children coming to too much harm, so at first, we planned to look for Lyudmila.
[name="Lillia"]  But then, we learned from Lyudmila's housekeeper that someone was sustaining contact with them, aiding them. Someone anonymous, but she seemed to know it all, inside and out.
[name="Lillia"]  The same anonym had even set up a way for her to leave Ursus.
[name="Lillia"]  It was then I was sure that some were still alive. And to my knowledge, very few could accomplish something like that.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Have some tea.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Here I imagined you'd be itching to ask about my business at the Retreat.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Lillia, I imagine the one who's really itching here is you.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  And you knew all along exactly where Vanya was... you're really just going to sit on the sidelines? You should know all the secrets he's holding onto!
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The true secrets have already been sealed for eternity in that research institute, thanks to Ilia's perseverance. Even now, the Army haven't been able to find a single scrap of the gains they were drooling for.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And Grand Duke Vanya is incurably ill. He'll recuperate at Pine Valley every winter. Provided you have any way to sneak into a so-called high-class salon even once, it's not hard to come by the information.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  He even brags all over about how the retreat is so beautiful and vast.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Correct. There is no shortage of Ursus soldiers with outstanding service there, and of course, bureaucrats and nobles too.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Infiltrating it and assassinating a Grand Duke would be as absurd as you, in Chernobog, charging into Count Boris's house with a knife, slitting his throat open and then escaping again untouched.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  You're right. But for those 'bureaucrats and nobles,' security in there is still weak enough to make people restless.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I won't deny that. But how do you know that's not a signal, one that Grand Duke Vanya is no longer an important figure, or that...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Or that his fate has already been set by certain people? I've told you, Kal'tsit, what I want isn't a fair trial. To make it clear, what I long for is a lynching.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2", name2="avg_npc_168_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ......
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2", name2="avg_npc_168_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Now's not the time to discuss justice or morality, Kal'tsit. Only those who can rest easy at night enjoy using 'objectivity' as a shield.
[name="Lillia"]  Whether Grand Duke Vanya is censured by the military or the Emperor, becomes a scapegoat, stands the wrong side in political conflict, suffers banishment, is stowed away by the Army...
[name="Lillia"]  —No matter what, even if he dies miserably in the end at the gallows, what business is that of mine?
[name="Lillia"]  It was him who pushed for all of Chernobog to sink into deeper ruin, and all I know is he should pay the price. He should pay the price to us! He's the murderer who killed my child's father!
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2", name2="avg_npc_168_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Kal'tsit!
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#3", name2="avg_npc_168_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I'm listening...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#3", name2="avg_npc_168_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  I've already figured out how to infiltrate the retreat... but I also need to admit, even if the security there is suspiciously weak, that doesn't mean any of us can pull this off smoothly.
[name="Lillia"]  I've found a breach. Someone who's been in charge of security at that noble's sanatorium for thirty-plus years, but hasn't had the guts to make much side-money off it for fear of the nobles.
[name="Lillia"]  I... prepared a huge sum, with my colleagues' help. That complete life failure, who we all saw could retire any day, caved in instantly.
[name="Lillia"]  We spent immense effort to gain his trust. I was simply the daughter of a country upstart, only wanting to intern at the retreat to get close with some noble or officer.
[name="Lillia"]  But...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You want me to help you.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Yes. Forging any identity has risks no matter what, but to my mind, the retreat and the information agency wouldn't be that tied up, so—
[name="Lillia"]  If even the Secret Police are fooled into thinking you're dead—
[name="Lillia"]  —then death will be your open road.
