[name="W"]  I mean, Reunion isn’t dumb, so they wouldn’t waste perfectly good medical supplies... So if you wanna save your little pal Rublev, you’re gonna have to steal.
[name="W"]  It’s a bunch of Infected thugs over there. Thugs who murdered your family and friends.
[name="W"]  And that’s the only place they’ll have the drugs that can stop the onset of Oripathy.
[name="W"]  So go steal, rob, loot, it’s all good.
[name="W"]  Just don’t expect anybody to help you.

[name="Waifish Child"]  I...
[Character(name="avg_npc_046#2")]
[name="W"]  He doesn’t have to listen to you.
[name="W"]  It’s good that you wanna save those people.
[name="W"]  Just keep that hospital in mind. They keep the supplies down in an underground storeroom. 
[name="W"]  You could get in through the vents in the parking garage, or through the sewers, as long as there’s not too much toxic waste down there.
[name="W"]  You could die there though.
