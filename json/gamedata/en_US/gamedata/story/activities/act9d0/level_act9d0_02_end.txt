To the north of Kazdel lies a birch forest.
There, the progression of life unfolds. From Spring it begins, and in Winter it ceases.
And only death thrives in the long winters. All living things make their exodus in unison, leaving only the Originium crystals speckled along the ground to reflect the somber moonlight.
...Pale, withered tree trunks hang lifelessly, their slender shadows intertwining and stacking upon empty expanses of snow.
That is the scenery I saw.

[name="W"]  We were ambushed an hour ago. They were quick. Our caster had no time to put up a barrier, and our team got split up. We’re the only ones here.

[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  You get it now? We’re not your regular mercenaries. We’re not hitmen either.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  What if we do this? There’s the two of you, plus your leader. Only one of you three has to die. 
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  The other two bring back a head. I don’t care whose. We pin all the losses on the head and take in the survivors.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Not that this is my call. But we have to do something for our fallen men.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Things could’ve gone a different way if we weren’t meeting on the battlefield.
[Character(name="avg_npc_046")]
[name="W"]  That’s awful nice of you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052")]
[name="Ines"]  Just my luck. I suck at fighting. I probably can’t beat this ugly bitch.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052", name2="avg_npc_046", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Now we’re so honest all of a sudden.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052", name2="avg_npc_046", focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Yeah, so the only other choice is for us to team up and kill Hoederer.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052", name2="avg_npc_046", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Yep. Hoederer.
[Character(name="avg_npc_053")]
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  So——

[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Tell me... why do mercenaries insist on getting killed?
[Character(name="avg_npc_046")]
[name="W"]  I’m not gonna stay on the side that’s getting played. I’d much rather play with someone else’s life.
[name="W"]  Plus, I’m real sick of listening to you. You’re boring. And your shitty little attempt at a death game sucks.

[Character(name="avg_npc_046")]
[name="W"]  Oh, and my poor little lamb here steadily going blind...
[name="W"]  She’s not Sarkaz. You noticed, right? You stepped right into her minefield. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_053")]
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  You know how this will end. You’ve already lost.
[Character(name="avg_npc_046")]
[name="W"]  Oh?
[name="W"]  I dunno about that one...

Are you really going? The landship is right here.
Yes, I didn’t expect them to spot it so soon. Did intel blow this one?
At least we’ve got the mercenaries.
We put them in danger. They have no idea what’s happening.
They’re mercenaries. They live for this. And sooner or later... it will be our burden too.
I can save them. I can save some of the men who would die for our mistakes.
You’re right, Theresa, but...
There isn’t a single Sarkaz, not a single person, who should die for nothing.
...*Sigh*... Then I’m coming with you.
Good. Thank you——
