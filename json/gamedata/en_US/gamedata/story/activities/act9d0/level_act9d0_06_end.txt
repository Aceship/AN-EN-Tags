[name="Confessarius"]  I have seen your report.
[name="Confessarius"]  Your achievements with Reunion are, to say the least, not worthy of commendation.
[name="Confessarius"]  However, that being said, you have indeed procured some unexpectedly useful information.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055", name2="avg_npc_047", focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Thank——
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]  No, there is no need for thanks. At least, not this time.
[name="Confessarius"]  You are all impressive warriors, and until your deaths, you are entitled to the rewards you’ve earned by virtue of the blood, sweat, and tears you have shed.
[name="Confessarius"]  His Majesty the Regent knows well the acts and deeds of all Sarkaz, even those as insignificant as yourself.
[name="Confessarius"]  The Infected are not the only thing in this temple gradually depreciating. Do you understand?
[Character(name="avg_npc_055", name2="avg_npc_047", focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  ...I do.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]  Mm.
[name="Confessarius"]  If I am correct in my predictions, Rhodes Island has already welcomed the return of a certain unpalatable individual.
[name="Confessarius"]  And you... you should have made contact.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  ——!
[name="Hoederer"]  (The Regent is even faster than W? All the way from Londinium?!)
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]  Mercenaries know loyalty only to their own interests. But that nonetheless makes a fine starting point.
[name="Confessarius"]  When the dust settles, and you stand once again before the throne of His Majesty——
[name="Confessarius"]  That is when you will receive your reward.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055", name2="avg_npc_047", focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  And what about the other warriors?
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]  The young Infected has her own plans. Were you unaware?
[name="Confessarius"]  But His Majesty will not participate in such nonsense. We have mutually decided that Victoria will stand by and watch Reunion’s next move.
[name="Confessarius"]  We lack “effective measures” to retake control of that unit from W.
[name="Confessarius"]  Furthermore, it is important that we, in the name of our supporters, continue to whip up the Infected in all corners of the world.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055", name2="avg_npc_047", focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  We’re still going to use Reunion? I was sure His Majesty would have...
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]  Given up? Oh my no, young mercenary.
[name="Confessarius"]  Things are yet far from chaotic enough. Even if Reunion has strayed from its leadership, it remains a source of chaos——
[name="Confessarius"]  What’s more, should your words just now be taken as a question of His Majesty’s intentions?
[Character(name="avg_npc_055", name2="avg_npc_047", focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  No, absolutely not.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055", name2="avg_npc_047", focus=1)]
[name="Confessarius"]  Very well. Raise your head...
[name="Confessarius"]  Oh, yes.
[name="Confessarius"]  For the time being, you need not return to Kazdel. The journey back is too long, and matters have been progressing rapidly there.
[name="Confessarius"]  You are to stay here, for now. Enjoy this small respite however you can.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055", name2="avg_npc_047", focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Thank you very much.
[Character(name="avg_npc_055")]
[name="Confessarius"]  Now then, His Majesty awaits me. You are dismissed.
[name="Confessarius"]  Remember, see to your own business first, Hoederer.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  Of course.

[name="Hoederer"]  ...*Sigh*.
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  Looks like it’s house arrest for both of us?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  It’s not like I never thought about it. And hey, it’s better than I was expecting...
[name="Hoederer"]  But we were a little too naive.
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  Which part was naive? The part where you thought you’d die, or the part where you thought the Regent didn’t know?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  Both. He’s been pulling the strings from the start.
[name="Hoederer"]  Not that I’m surprised... he’s Theresis. We’ve all heard the stories about him and Theresa, the invincible forces of nature...
[name="Hoederer"]  But I guess in the course of the war, I forgot those stories... weren’t just stories.
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  So how do we warn W? What’s going on with Reunion?
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  We wasted so much time on the road. She might’ve already split with Talulah.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  The other possibility is the show ends in Lungmen.
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  Wouldn’t that be a bit too quick?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  It fits with the way W works. If Talulah’s gonna destroy the Infected, W’ll destroy Talulah first.
[name="Hoederer"]  Sarkaz style. With extreme prejudice.
[name="Hoederer"]  She’s pretty upset over the death of a certain merc, after all.
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  She knows the score.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  She’s out of room to hesitate any longer. Now she just needs to get into the right headspace to make a move.
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  And that means we’re left waiting.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  We’ve got ways to fool the Regent’s eyes. It’d be a crazy risky play, but...
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  I’ve still got my own squad I can keep on “standby.”
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  Victoria’s all over the place right now. They probably wouldn’t catch the code.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  Yeah, and it would have to pass by some real tricky spots controlled by the Regent... and on to Kazdel.
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  Kazdel?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  The battlefield ruins there haven’t been touched in a long time.
[name="Hoederer"]  But we eked out a living there for a good long time.
[name="Hoederer"]  There was a communications station in an old bunker buried under those ruins. The tower made it look like it was destroyed, but everything down there still works.
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  Hold on, that was a long time ago...
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  How long have you been preparing this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  All done way back at the very beginning. Cost me a pretty penny too.
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  Heh heh.
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  Oh man... if they saw the look on your face right now, boy would they be surprised.
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  For a while now, every time you came back from a battle, you were always deep in thought, like a kid who did something bad.
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  I figured you’d just lost your will to fight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  Nah, it was the opposite, actually. I finally realized what it was I had to do.
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  How?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  Because I had no choice. It’s kind of liberating, in a way?
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  W must’ve said something to you before you left Chernobog.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  Does that sound like her? Laying all the cards on the table?
[Character]
[name="Sarkaz Messenger"]  No. She’d be a lot less of a pain if she did though.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  You’re right that she came looking for me before I left the core city. She knew what we were going to do.
[name="Hoederer"]  She...

[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  The war itself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Sure... you got your battlefield honors, your victories, the glory you pull out of a hand-to-hand fight, all the things that raise your profile, that let everybody know what a useful tool you are.
[name="W"]  So boring.
[name="W"]  But that’s all in the past. At least for us it is.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  ...What do you mean?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Every Sarkaz merc should have a nice, clean price tag.
[name="W"]  But we don’t need anybody to slap it on. No oversight. They write their own price in the blood of the enemies of Sarkaz.

[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  You’re talking about doing that right in front of Theresis, in broad daylight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  You make it sound so bad. As if you don’t have your own plans.

The ruins of Chernobog weren’t like those of Kazdel.
