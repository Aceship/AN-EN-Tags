[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_hoederer")] Pay attention to that <@tu.kw>Sentinel</>. Looking at that weird formation, I have a hunch that there are a lot more enemies out there than we expected.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_hoederer")] Once we damage a Sentinel, they’ll go <@tu.kw>Alert</> their entire team. Sadly, we have no way of assassinating them before they make a sound, and they certainly won’t go down easily.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_hoederer")] Needless to say, mercenaries rallied under a banner will fight better as a team, and all enemies on Standby will become <@tu.kw>Combat-Ready</>.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ines")] Prioritize eliminating enemies on <@tu.kw>Standby</> first, and once there are no more troops underneath the banner, a commander without troops makes for easy pickings.
