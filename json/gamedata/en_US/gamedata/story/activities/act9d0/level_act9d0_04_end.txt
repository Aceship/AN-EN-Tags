What happened to Babel? Any Sarkaz in contact with Her Majesty Theresa at the time would’ve asked this question.
W definitely saw the truth, but she said nothing during the long journey.
I didn’t ask, and neither did Ines. But, I think she’s closer to the truth than I am.
Before I knew it, I found myself trailing behind everyone else.

[name="Ines"]  What happened?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  The scouts spotted a Catastrophe brewing, with no Catastrophe Messengers nearby. We should stay as far away as possible, just in case.
[name="Hoederer"]  We can’t risk it, no matter what.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  ...A Catastrophe, huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  It’s rare to see one raging in the wilderness.
[name="Hoederer"]  But we have plenty of experience dealing with Originium in Kazdel, so no need to panic.
[name="Hoederer"]  ...Where’s W?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  She’s with her team.
[name="Ines"]  ...Need her for something?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  I’m... not sure. She’s changed a lot.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Do you think her personality would change that much just because Theresa is gone?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  She’s too calm. It’s unlike her.
[name="Hoederer"]  But when we found her on the battlefield earlier, she still had that cynical, sarcastic expression.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  If anything, she’s only gotten worse.
[name="Ines"]  That’s odd. I never thought you’d be perceptive enough to pick up on these subtle warning signs.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  ...Save the jabs. If W’s being quiet, that warning sign’s far from “subtle.”

[name="Hoederer"]  Find W, and make it quick.

We have more and more fresh faces on the team, but I feel better, knowing that I left Kazdel.
Among those traveling with me are both friends and enemies, but it’s always been volatile like that.
Mercenaries don’t care too much about the past because for our kind, life and death are easy come, easy go.
Maybe because the war ended too quickly, we immediately plunged first into the next battle without ever tasting a moment of peace.
...This kind of hope could just be another poison. Since the beginning, we’ve always needed war and conflict to ease this balance.
W is the best example of this. She’s long become drunk on it.

War has never been something that can be avoided.
I’ve always known that, of course. But at that moment, I truly realized it.
War has permeated every corner of this world. It always has, ever since the first sentient thing was born.
And, we will become mired in it again.
