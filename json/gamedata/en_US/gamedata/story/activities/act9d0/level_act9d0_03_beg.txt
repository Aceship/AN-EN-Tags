The Sarkaz stopped.
The burning ruins collapsed in towards the center. Those monstrous creatures looked down on us from above.
A woman suddenly emerged from the center of the circle. A very... strange woman.
She wasn’t Sarkaz. She stood in the center of the battlefield, her expression unchanging.
Ines was trembling, but I couldn’t tell you why.
The explosion must have damaged my hearing. I couldn’t hear what they were saying.
But I knew they were afraid.
Was it because of her?
No, their attention was focused in another direction, on someone else.
In the seconds before I lost consciousness, I saw——
A... Sarkaz.
An unthreatening... slender Sarkaz.
