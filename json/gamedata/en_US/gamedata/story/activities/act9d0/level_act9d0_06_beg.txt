[name="Hoederer"]  ...You’ve met all the Reunion leaders.
[name="Hoederer"]  What’d you think?
[Character(name="avg_npc_046#2")]
[name="W"]  Are you asking me, or her?
[name="W"]  If you ask me, I’d say nothing out of the ordinary. The stuff they do is pretty par for the course for people like that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052")]
[name="Ines"]  A strange bunch. There’s a child who seems to been purposefully pushed into that position to the point of becoming cruel, and then there’s a warrior whose toughness is beyond imagination.
[Character(name="avg_npc_046#2")]
[name="W"]  There are some incredible people, but then there are also some two-bit villains.
[name="W"]  All I can say is, we’ve seen all kinds of people after fighting wars all these years.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052")]
[name="Ines"]  But, there is someone who caught my eye...
[Character(name="avg_npc_052", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Oh, you must be talking about that one. The one who was waiting at the side with that other little rabbit.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Their squad seemed on a completely different level compared to those ordinary Infected. That kind of Sarkaz warrior can be said to truly bear the mark of war.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  Sarkaz...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_046#2")]
[name="W"]  Yeah, but you don’t see Sarkaz like that every day. He claims to be with Ursus, saying he broke off contact with Kazdel long ago.
[name="W"]  How pitiful. He never needed to live such an exhausting life.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052")]
[name="Ines"]  Maybe we should all go meet him.
[name="Ines"]  The impression I got from him... was that he has become much more than a “warrior.”
[name="Ines"]  And you, don’t you love thinking about things? Instead of philosophizing, why not have a chat with someone like that?
[name="Ines"]  We might all learn a lot from him.

[name="???"]  I just want to hear...
[name="???"]  About my countrymen. About my homeland. What has become of them.
[name="???"]  I know that, in Kazdel. Many things happened.
[name="???"]  Some things, I have heard. But details, no.
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  You’re just an Ursusian.
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1")]
[name="???"]  These two identities. Do not conflict.
[name="???"]  The bloodline. Has not changed. Dark, and deeply rooted.
[name="???"]  I care not for it. But run from it? I cannot.
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  So even if I told you, what do you plan to do?
[name="W"]  These things happened a long time ago for me—
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1")]
[name="???"]  Nothing. There is nothing. I can do.
[name="???"]  But, it has been so long. Since I saw Theresa.
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Ooh...
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1")]
[name="???"]  From your reactions. I see. She is with you. Her mark is here. After all, you are Sarkaz.
[name="???"]  Muddied. Blood-soaked.
[name="???"]  She is a hero, at least. So respected. A great warrior. A worthy ruler.
[name="???"]  My flesh. Loyal to Ursus. From my people, I exiled myself. But I, am still Sarkaz.
[name="???"]  I want to know. What happened to her Kazdel.
[name="???"]  I just, want to know.

[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  We hope that your mercenaries can give us an explanation.
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  First, your team defected. The people who went after them reported back that you weren’t even trying.
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  A few hours ago, some enemies managed to infiltrate Chernobog. Again, due to your negligence.
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  Combined with the fact that when we first captured Chernobog, someone tipped us off that you let—
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Okay, okay, I got it. The client’s dissatisfied with our performance. Can you say that with fewer words?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  We’re simply in a “cooperative” relationship, and I’m the leader now. If I get on this table and start grovelling, will Talulah be happy?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Or, did having Papa Patriot around give you the illusion... that Reunion is actually good at fighting a war?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Make no mistake about who the people actually capable of bringing you victory are.

[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  If you’ve figured it out, hurry up and crawl back to that dragon girl. I’ll tell her what she wants to know soon enough, so don’t rush me.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  There’s one other thing.
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  Just now, stragglers from an enemy party were detected inside the city. That mercenary, Ines, died after exchanging fire with them.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  ...
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  Reunion also participated in this battle. The enemies were very strong, and we all suffered losses.
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  This is all due to your negligence.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  ...There’s no need to get pushy with me.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  Precisely.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  So... where’s the body?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  Unfortunately, I have bad news.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  I’m talking about the enemy’s corpses. Ines wouldn’t use such flashy, destructive Arts.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  Our casters were also involved in the battle. The entire street was destroyed.

[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  ...Our main force is focused on the battle that will take place in Lungmen. We have no time to waste here.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  The Leader won’t investigate your responsibility in this just yet, so you should handle it yourself.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Hmm... You have a pretty thick Ursus accent.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]

[name="W"]  Let’s talk business first.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  ...Three things.
[name="Hoederer"]  First, Ines wanted to warn you that something’s wrong with Talulah. She must’ve seen something more specific, but I’m not clear on that.
[name="Hoederer"]  All she told me was, Talulah apparently had “two shadows.” From her reaction, this isn’t some common byproduct of Arts interference.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  That damn coward... Why wouldn’t she ever be straightforward...
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Second, the old man has left. Received an order to go fetch something. Talulah didn’t even make any efforts to hide it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  ...
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  ...Finally, a messenger has already set off for Victoria. Shortly, the Regent will know everything that has happened here.
[name="Hoederer"]  Theresis knows many things, and he has just as many monsters around him.
[name="Hoederer"]  If he is allowed to intervene, this would no longer be a simple question between Reunion and Ursus...
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  ...
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  W! Are you listening to me?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  ...Too noisy. Since it’s all good news anyway, let me have some peace and quiet.
[name="W"]  You’ve had your hand on the hilt of your blade... ever since you walked through the door.
[name="W"]  You were like that when we first met, as if you were ready to cut me down at any moment.
[name="W"]  But the way you stayed calm back there was just like Patriot—
[name="W"]  What do you really think about this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  That’s not important.
[Character(name="avg_npc_046#2")]
[name="W"]  And none of us are. We all know this, and bad habits die hard.
[name="W"]  Ines, she...
[name="W"]  I have the right to hear what she said, right? ...In order to respect her sacrifice.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  ...You two are both similar. Never considering the consequences of the things you do.
[name="Hoederer"]  The Regent will not sit idly and watch them lose control. If you can’t give him a suitable answer, Londinium’s summons will destroy everything you’ve painstakingly put together.
[name="Hoederer"]  Ironically, I still don’t know what you’re trying to accomplish, even now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  ...Who knows?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  The reason you have the right to ask questions is because you avoided the center of the whirlpool.

[name="Hoederer"]  Really? Who’s still left on Rhodes Island now?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  ...Why are you asking that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  I’ve seen your interactions with the messenger. You’ve been investigating Rhodes Island’s trail.
[name="Hoederer"]  That drug company... I had assumed they only got caught up in that war, but turns out, the truth isn’t so simple.
[name="Hoederer"]  Especially, Scout...
[name="Hoederer"]  ...According to your plan, we were in charge of all the other fronts during the battle to hold Chernobog.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Yeah, and you guys did a great job—
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  But, someone still found him, the ghost of Babel. You chose to find him yourself, and then you let him go.
[name="Hoederer"]  In the past, I would’ve seen this as a sign of untrustworthiness.
[name="Hoederer"]  But by the looks of things, you didn’t plan to keep that secret for long anyway.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Ugh, what point is there in hiding that?
[name="W"]  If you’ve ever fought in a battle, you’re bound to know some people who have a bit of a reputation.
[name="W"]  After all, if those people have been fighting tooth and nail to hang on, there’s no getting around it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  What’s your plan now? We shouldn’t have had to fight against them in the first place.
[name="Hoederer"]  If that Kal'tsit is still in charge of Rhodes Island,  this might be a chance...
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  No.
[name="W"]  What do you think my objective is?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  ...I see.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  You said you’d help me do this one thing. We agreed on it.

[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Ines can no longer help you.
[name="Hoederer"]  And soon... I’ll have to leave too.

[name="W"]  Oh, I haven’t heard about this before. Where to?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  I’ll head back to Victoria with the messenger. It’ll be about a three or four-month trip. We’ll leave tomorrow morning before sunrise.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  ...Are you in that much of a hurry to reunite with Ines in death? With your reputation, you plan to head back to Londinium carrying all that sin on your shoulders?
[name="W"]  You’d probably be better off fleeing back to Kazdel.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  You killed Garcin and reorganized the mercenaries. Someone has to report this to the Regent.
[name="Hoederer"]  If nobody goes to report this, he’ll treat us like disowned children and cast us straight into the next warzone. A battlefield within his reach.
[name="Hoederer"]  When that time comes, there really will be no place to run.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  You’re taking this risk to cover for me? Why would you do that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Her Majesty, Theresa... She remembered my name. And my family.
[name="Hoederer"]  Though Her Majesty is no longer here, there’s a part of her left in this piece of shit, no good squad.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  How come I’ve never seen it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Mm. No matter how perverse the Sarkaz’s personalities and methods may be, judging from the results, they’re still fighting for that lofty, unrealistic idea.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  ...Do you even know what you’re talking about?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  We’ve known each other for a long time, W.
[name="Hoederer"]  That’s all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Out of compassion, let me also give you a reminder.
[name="W"]  This is your best opportunity to escape Kazdel. Leave from here, past Lungmen and Ursus, to the distant lands beyond. I’m willing to keep one eye closed.
[name="W"]  But if you go back, know that you will die.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Hah... Just earlier, you said you wanted me to help you do your thing.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  If your idea of helping me is just committing suicide, then I suggest you hang on to your life instead.
[name="W"]  When it’s my turn to collect, I’d like some of my debtors to still be alive.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  I wouldn’t necessarily be going there to die. Depending on the Regent’s mood, there are many possible outcomes.
[name="Hoederer"]  Reunion has been manipulated into something far beyond what you can imagine. The Regent may well change his mind.
[name="Hoederer"]  ...In any case, I no longer have the luxury of running away.
[name="Hoederer"]  I’ve left Kazdel. And I’m about to leave here. What’s the worst that could happen? Patriot has already taught me enough.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  You’ve been influenced by him a lot, just from your short time here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Just like you were, with Theresa. It’s all the same, isn’t it?
[name="Hoederer"]  Theresis sits on his throne. Even if I am only able to grovel my way up there with my head pressed against the ground, I must reach where he is, and figure out what he is thinking.
[name="Hoederer"]  Otherwise, if we continue acting recklessly as we are now, that will truly be committing suicide.

[name="W"]  You know, you could also just submit to him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  I’ve thought about that before. Just so you know, Garcin was always suspicious of you. He even gave me the order to kill you once.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Oh? Sounds like things would’ve been a bit more entertaining if you had listened to him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Sorry, but I’m not into the same kind of stuff you’re into.
[name="Hoederer"]  Now, let’s decide.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Hm... I won’t deny that I’m curious about what Theresis is up to.
[name="W"]  Seems like I have no choice though.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  That’s right. Even if you rejected my proposal, I don’t plan to let you keep running the show.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  You’re not gonna say that this is for my good, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Of course not. What kind of Sarkaz goes around taking care of others?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  ...How disappointing, you’ve just gone right back to your old ways. I thought you were going to keep falling.
[name="W"]  So, do you already have a plan?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Why don’t you go ask Ines?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  That’s a really unfunny joke.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Then, before I leave, let me tell you another joke.
[name="Hoederer"]  Ines once told me that you looked more and more like a lunatic, but your actions got less and less decisive.
[Character(name="avg_npc_046#2")]
[name="W"]  Who, me? Do you really believe that?
[name="W"]  Have I been using fewer bombs recently?
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  Maybe. No matter how good you might be at hiding it, we’ve worked together for far too many years.
[name="Hoederer"]  Who’s to say, maybe we trusted you this whole time.

[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_047", focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Before I leave, there’s something I’d like to confirm...
[name="Hoederer"]  Did any of you personally see Ines fall in battle?
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2", name2="avg_npc_047", focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  No.
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  As soon as we received the support request, the battle was over.
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  The street had been torn apart, and the Originium crystals left by the Catastrophe caused a violent chain reaction.
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  We got the situation under control with fairly minimal—

[name="Reunion Soldier"]  ...
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  You give off the stench of conspiracy and war. A stench that is all too familiar—
[name="Hoederer"]  If Ines was still here, that’s definitely what she’d say.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2")]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  So that’s what this is about. It’s all too common for people to vent their anger on the Infected over a fallen comrade.
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  I just thought you would’ve been a little smarter than W.
[Character(name="avg_npc_047")]
[name="Hoederer"]  ...A little smarter, huh?
[name="Hoederer"]  Yeah, looking back, I’ve been a bit overprotective of her. Always have been.
[name="Hoederer"]  But not because I was afraid she’d get in trouble. You see, I was more afraid that I’d have nobody to kill.
[name="Hoederer"]  After all, I’m also a Sarkaz... the real deal.
