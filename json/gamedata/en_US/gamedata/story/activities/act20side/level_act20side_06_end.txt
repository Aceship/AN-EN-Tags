[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#6$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Uh, didn't Stitch? And the people who brought all those library books back from overground?
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#9$1")]
[name="Gavial"]And look, nothing in the rulebook says you can't, right?
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1")]
[name="Gavial"]I mean, listen to you guys. The tunnel's too dangerous, a new shelter's gonna take too long.
[name="Gavial"]So, you head up top and take refuge in Acahualla for a while. That's the best plan to me.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#8$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]That lift could hardly hold so many...
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]......
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#6$1")]
[name="Gavial"]What?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]I really want to refute you, but...
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]Your group missed it during your time in Zeruertza, but trains are by far the most common means of transport in Durin society.
[name="Avdotya"]Though lifts are convenient for vertical movement...
[name="Avdotya"]Durin cities aren't nomadic, so they face the risk of destruction from the moment they're built. Lifts that can only move vertically have far less use to them than trains do.
[name="Avdotya"]Moreover, Durin explorers have calculated that Durin cities often lie 1000 to 1500m below the surface. Hardly any cities exist outside of that range.
[name="Avdotya"]Which is to say, Durins probe the underground in horizontals. It's rare for there to be one city just a hundred, maybe two hundred meters below another.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#6$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Uh... so what does this have to do with the lift?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]I know explaining this to you is a waste of time, but I have to show responsibility for others here.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#5$1")]
[name="Gavial"]What? All you're trying to tell me is trains are more Durin-handy, yeah?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]*sigh* I suppose so.
[name="Avdotya"]And given that, what purpose would a lift then have for existing?
[Character(name="avg_npc_571_1#1$1")]
[name="Elysium"]I get it. It's for resources, isn't it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_571_1#12$1")]
[name="Elysium"]I don't claim to know why the Durins tend to expand their cities horizontally. Some kind of ingrained habit, I guess.
[Character(name="avg_npc_571_1#1$1")]
[name="Elysium"]But forget that. It doesn't mean they scout out resources horizontally as well. Right?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]I thought you were playing the braggart when you claimed you'd been places. I can definitely see your prowess now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_571_1#4$1")]
[name="Elysium"]Wowie.
[Character(name="avg_npc_571_1#1$1")]
[name="Elysium"]Gavial, check it. Even Miss Avdotya here sees my worth better than you do.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#2$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Big whoop. Don't care.
[Character(name="avg_npc_571_1#2$1")]
[name="Elysium"]Miss Avdotya, next time you get into an argument with Gavial, I'm on your side.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]I'll be fine, thank you.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#8$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]Anyhow, you're correct. The Durins are filled with a passion for probing underground, especially for minerals.
[name="Avdotya"]In addition, city planning requires the joint decisions of many, while digging is something each Durin is free to commit to at their leisure.
[name="Avdotya"]Consequently, they often end up digging several hundred meters above or below their cities out of sheer unawareness.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]In fact, quite a number of Durin historians believe...
[name="Avdotya"]The first Durin lift was only designed when an industrial representative discovered a vein in the roof of their very own city, and that it would be most convenient to dig straight to it.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]However, following an unchecked surge of Durin interest in the surface, such lifts have often been used as shortcuts to the overground.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#9$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Huh... so you're saying Durins mainly use it to shift ore, and sometimes there's little scamps like Stitch hitching a ride on them to have some surface fun.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#3$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"]I've told you, I'm about the same age as you, Gavial!
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Uh-huh, sure. So, I mean, I get all that, but I still don't understand what you're getting AT.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#7$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]*sigh*...
[Character(name="avg_npc_571_1#1$1")]
[name="Elysium"]Miss Avdotya's trying to say that since Durin lifts are mostly designed for industry, they're real sturdy stuff.
[name="Elysium"]Tomimi and me sure noticed that when we came down. The lift could hold a few dozen people, no sweat.
[name="Elysium"]So, Gavial, your suggestion's pretty feasible.
[name="Elysium"]Right, Master Edge?
[Character(name="avg_npc_564_1#5$1")]
[name="Edge Eartheart"]Hear, hear.
[name="Edge Eartheart"]I can confirm, the Super Convenient Lift-o-Matic #1 was designed after a vote, which came after some numbskull with nothing to do found a vein up above.
[Character(name="avg_npc_564_1#9$1")]
[name="Edge Eartheart"]But then we found a vein even closer, so the thing went by the wayside.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#5$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Oh, that tracks. I heard that one cave got mined clean. You think it was you Durin guys who dug the entire cave out in the first place?
[Character(name="avg_npc_564_1#1$1")]
[name="Edge Eartheart"]That, I couldn't say. It's possible.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]In addition, to cope with potential future situations, the Durins would have naturally dug out more space while planning the lift, for ease of future enlargement.
[Character(name="avg_npc_571_1#10$1")]
[name="Elysium"]Which means, if we're going to make the most reasonable use of our remaining time, enlarging the lifts and getting the Durins to the surface is definitely the way to go.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#3$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Oh. You could've just said that then.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#8$1")]

Gavial swallows a sliver of hesitation.
She realizes the choice is now facing her, waiting, and she didn't even notice that it came.
No, she's not unwilling to assume this duty. Far from it.
Not even on her vagrant trails, not even in her days on end at Rhodes Island, did she ever forget Acahualla and her people.
However—
Neither has she forgotten the decision she made, when she resolved to leave Acahualla in the first place.
She was going to study medicine. She was going to save the Oripathy sufferers.
Those two choices she made were the right ones, and they were what she wanted. That's how simple it was. That's why she's never found it this hard to choose.

[name="Gavial"]Let me think up a way to describe it.
[name="Gavial"]Yeah. Okay, it's like. I've got this giant boulder in front of me right now.
[name="Gavial"]And I'm thinking, I have to use up so much of my strength just to break it.
[name="Gavial"]But once I give it a shot, something tells me, wow, you can break this thing so easily.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#7$1")]
[name="Gavial"]But it's like, why? Even though it's so big.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2")]

[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1")]

[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2")]
[name="Eunectes"]I stayed for days straight making it for you, and the materials are all the best I could get too.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#5$1")]

[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2")]
[name="Eunectes"]I'm telling you because I want you to understand—I don't need you to thank me for making these things for you.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2")]
[name="Eunectes"]Because—
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1")]

[name="Gavial"]What the hell does that mean?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#5")]
[name="Eunectes"]Something very simple—
[name="Eunectes"]Your fists are bigger than you think, Gavial.
[name="Eunectes"]Because you have me.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#5",name2="avg_npc_572_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]And me!
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2",name2="avg_npc_572_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]And the Rhodes Islanders, and all the people you've saved, and everyone in Acahualla too.
[name="Eunectes"]Because in the end, you're right, Gavial.
[name="Eunectes"]Ultimately, all those guys you beat into submission are willing to recognize you, because they realize that in the end, you're right.
[name="Eunectes"]Gavial, you believe in the right things. You've never gone wrong.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2",name2="avg_npc_572_1#7$1",focus=2)]

Standing by Avdotya, Inam can sense that this Lupo woman to her side is having a somewhat hard time believing her eyes.
But to herself, it's a trivial, banal thing.
She lets out a small sigh.
She knows that finally, she's come to a decision too.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]

[name="Inam"]I've hung around with you as a government Messenger for all these years. I have the right to stand for lord ameer.
[name="Inam"]I just didn't want to before, that's all.
[name="Inam"]Seeing as we'd have to force Tomimi back from Rhodes Island, whereas I've been in Acahualla the whole time, I'd make a tidier fit for lord ameer, wouldn't I?
[name="Inam"]And I imagine that better assuages your concerns, Avdotya.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]Yes, it does, but I have to say, you people really boggle my mind...

[name="Avdotya"]The likelihood is, nobody in modern-day Zeruertza does.
[name="Avdotya"]But you know the Durin adventurers, filled with the spirit of exploration? Each time they finish a foray, they're always happy to record everything they've seen and heard in books, so they can share with their companions.
[name="Avdotya"]And in the library, I once read such an adventurer's log, which finely detailed how he went through the cave network above the lift, and made it to the surface.
[name="Avdotya"]And while I don't know where said adventurer is now, he was considerate enough to leave behind a map.
