[name="Croque Diamondface"]Catch was an incessant one at the meetings. He kept selling his ideas and the advantages of his design.
[name="Croque Diamondface"]As for Stitch, all he ever did was lay his designs on the table before standing aside. It seemed kind of like he would rather we see his ideas for ourselves instead of wasting his energy to explain them.

The forum is dead silent.
All the Durins are attentively listening to Avdotya tell her story.
Though her story starts off warm, it slowly deteriorates into something more sinister as it progresses.
When the story gets going, the audience holds their collective breaths, only for Avdotya to explain how she survived, sending out a collective sigh of relief.
But that's only where it starts, it's the beginning of her hardships and tribulations, and she goes through much more as she recounts the story.

[name="Avdotya"]It's true.
[name="Avdotya"]Based on our discussions, we've arrived at three possible evacuation plans.
[name="Avdotya"]First, we could evacuate via the tunnels.
[name="Avdotya"]According to the calculations, even if we start evacuating right now as quickly as we can, we will likely only be able to evacuate seventy percent of our population to our sibling city on the other end before the explosion.
[name="Avdotya"]If that is the plan we are going with, we must start immediately, without delay.
[name="Avdotya"]The second plan would require us to immediately use all our resources to excavate in the opposite direction of the tunnel. In other words, dig toward the hole on the other side and open up a safe shelter for our temporary refuge.
[name="Avdotya"]As it stands, this proposal gives us a higher survival rate than the previous one, but the tunnel is our only connection to other cities.
[name="Avdotya"]The disaster will destroy most of our facilities, and under those circumstances, let's not mention the issue of whether this newly-excavated shelter will be able to hold everyone in the city...

In an instant, many things flash through his mind.
The joy he felt when he listened to his teacher's lectures.
The hatred he felt when his teacher left.
The disappointment he felt every time he walked out of the design department after losing a design contest.
Before he knew it, whenever he looked at the dome above him, it was anger that he felt, not excitement.
He thought the feeling was his alone and that not only could no one understand him, he did not need to be understood by anyone.
But, at this very moment, now that he's finally learned that there are those who truly want to understand him and help him...
He realizes that perhaps it is time to set that something down.

The forum is dead silent.
No one has a hand up.
Avdotya knows that this outcome is only to be expected. Heading to the surface is a big decision, and her speech alone could hardly be enough to persuade them.
When she looks at the Durins whispering among themselves, she knows that her story has had no effect on them.
The Durins are not afraid. All they need is an opportunity.
They still need a push.
She also feels guilt deep in her heart.
The old her definitely would have been leading the opposition against moving to the surface.
But now she is doing other Durins' work for this.
Her guilty feelings quickly disappear, as she knows she is doing what is right.
