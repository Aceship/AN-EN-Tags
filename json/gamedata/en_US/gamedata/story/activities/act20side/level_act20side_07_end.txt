[name="Catch Lightrace"]Right.
[name="Catch Lightrace"]I don't know why Master Finch left, all of a sudden. Others might believe their tutor-apprentice relationship was fading, or their time was just up, but I know that can't be the case.
[name="Catch Lightrace"]As a former assistant to Master Finch, I know more than anyone that despite his personal utter lack of inhibition, he cared very much for Stitch, from the bottom of his heart.
[name="Catch Lightrace"]Stitch was like a son to him.
[name="Catch Lightrace"]So his departure has to have some inextricable link to Stitch.
[name="Catch Lightrace"]And as industrial representative, you've seen the state Stitch has fallen into since his teacher left.
[name="Catch Lightrace"]His planning proposals kept getting overruled to the point he's slowly stopped showing up at the design department, and I've been seeing it happen and wanting to help him somehow, but I've never been able to find a way.
[name="Catch Lightrace"]This dome was left to the city as the grandest work of Stitch's teacher, Master Finch.
[name="Catch Lightrace"]But do you think, to Stitch, it might instead be a burden?
[Character(name="avg_npc_567_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_569_1#5$1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]You spent so long in here, I thought you were up to something...
[name="Inam"]Avdotya, you and I happen to be similar in ways.
[name="Inam"]A huge part of why I came to serve as Acahualla's Messenger was that I wanted to escape the unending strife between the lords ameer.
[name="Inam"]Acahualla has nothing to speak of, but life here is extremely comfortable. I'm a big fan of this land.
[name="Inam"]And also, if we're raising worries, then I'm more worried than you about the Durins' showing up causing issues.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]Then why are you still...
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]Gavial's been gone from Acahualla for so many years, and hasn't changed one bit.
[name="Inam"]As if nothing, anywhere, across all the four corners could make her surrender.
[name="Inam"]When I see Gavial, I think to myself, 'ah—so people like you still exist.'
[name="Inam"]I can't help but want to help her.
[name="Inam"]It's that simple.

[name="Eunectes"]Before I left Acahualla with Gavial, I was completely ignorant.
[name="Eunectes"]I've seen so many things with Rhodes Island, but I've slowly realized that what I'm really learning isn't just knowledge.
[name="Eunectes"]There's so much across the world that I've never thought of, that at the same time is exactly how you should expect.
[name="Eunectes"]I'm sure Gavial's seen plenty where she's just as powerless too.
[name="Eunectes"]My dream is to build the mightiest machine in any land.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]But truth is, I still haven't figured out what I should use it for when I'm done.
[name="Eunectes"]Still, seeing Gavial, I've gradually gotten some sort of idea.
[name="Eunectes"]The machines I make will be used to help her.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]There'll come a day when Gavial's fists meet a wall they can't break through.
[name="Eunectes"]But that's not a problem with her. She's flesh and blood too, after all.
[name="Eunectes"]And just like I've done here and now, I'll give her the greatest weapon.
[name="Eunectes"]If fists won't do it, then take an axe. If an axe won't do it, then take a hammer. If a hammer won't do it, then take a drill. If a drill won't do it, then I'll build her an entire Big, Ugly Thing.
[name="Eunectes"]And if a Big Ugly won't do it, then I'll build her a nomadic city, and whatever she wants to do with that, she will.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]You really trust her that much?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]I do. Because Gavial stands for Acahualla better than anyone or anything ever could.
[name="Eunectes"]She's the backbone of us, and in future, she'll be the backbone of even more.
[name="Eunectes"]And it's in our power, our own power, to make sure Gavial's fists are unhindered for eternity.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]Of course, realistically, I'm just as worried what leaving Acahualla to her purview will result in.
[name="Inam"]With Gavial's temperament, giving her authority might discomfort the powers more than it will her.
[name="Inam"]So, if she really was going to serve as lord ameer, I was planning to thoroughly groom her for it for a stretch.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]It probably wouldn't have done anything.
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]Haha, I think so too.
[name="Inam"]But even I never pictured I'd be willing to go so far for her.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]

[name="Avdotya"]I don't deny that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]So, maybe you can try to start by believing in her.

[name="High Priest"]And I only just realized this shelf has absolutely nothing to do with travel records!
