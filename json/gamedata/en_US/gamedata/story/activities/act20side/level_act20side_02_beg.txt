[name="Edge Eartheart"] I'm just telling you what the people of Zeruertza think. The water flow increased? Makes for a more stimulating experience. The temperature control stopped working? Even better, that just means the summer's not over yet!

[name="Edge Eartheart"] As for the Originium detection system... Well, no active Originium layers have been detected near Zeruertza for over two decades!

[name="Stitch Canvas"] Absolutely not. I was just trying to hide from you because you won't shut up.

[name="Edge Eartheart"] Now that's a little harsh, isn't it? Just a few months ago, I was voted into the Top 100 List of Zeruertza's Nicest Elders.

[name="Stitch Canvas"] Alright, enough of that. I know you're concerned about the state of the dome.
[name="Stitch Canvas"]But if Catch can't even solve the issue with the dome's integrity, then forget occupying the design representative's seat, he should get the hell out of Zeruertza.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_564_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] If we're just talking outcomes, there shouldn't be any safety concerns regarding the dome at this point.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_564_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] We can leave the temperature control system alone, since our beloved citizens are having a good time anyway. After they get tired of it, maybe they'll raise their hands and decide to turn Zeruertza into a walk-in freezer.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_564_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] As for that Originium detection system, if you ask me, it was never that reliable to begin with. But since you've been chasing me around everywhere, I assume that's what you're most worried about? I do have a plan for that actually.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_564_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] It'd be better for us to rebuild the railway bridge that was damaged by the earthquake, re-excavate the collapsed tunnels, and directly install the Originium detection instruments there for more accurate readings.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_564_1#7$1", focus=1)]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] From the very beginning, the dome was over-engineered to try to do too many things at once.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_564_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Edge Eartheart"] You'd rather take a massive detour like that than directly work on the dome? Look, even if Finch up and left without saying anything, that's still your work together, master and pupil...

[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_564_1#1$1", focus=2)]

[name="Lupo"]'Naturally, those who come with chainsaw and axe in hand can only spell calamity for this pure garden.'

[name="Lupo"]...... 'The beast of civilization finally sheds all pretense of hiding its razor-sharp fangs, baring its gigantic maw before us...'
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"] I see, that makes sense. A wild beast with a huge mouth and razor-sharp teeth. Don't worry, I'll handle this.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1")]
[name="Lupo"]Huh? No, that was a rhetorical flourish...
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"] As long as the thing's less than ten meters wide, I'm confident I can take it down clean. Perfect timing too, since I've been itching to get a good workout!

[name="Eunectes"]Mind showing us the way, Miss Lupo? Is it over here?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"] Maybe it'll be faster if we keep jumping down.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#3$1")]
[name="Lupo"]Stop, surface-dwellers! The blood on you will...
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"] Don't worry. I know how to control my strength so it's not going to splatter all over the place.

[name="Gavial"] Zumama, ready for round two?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#5", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#8$1", focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]Right behind you.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#5", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#8$1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"] Hold on tight, Miss Lupo.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#5", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#8$1", focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]You can trust Gavial. She's an expert when it comes to fighting.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#4$1")]
[name="Lupo"]Uh, actually, there's another way... Hey? Hey!!
