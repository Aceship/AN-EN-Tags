[name="Deculture Silvermint"]I didn't say you were wrong. While machine surveying of Originium has fallen out of fashion, the equipment we have is still usable.
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]Master Edge's problems will be solved once we build a boat and set things up.
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]He won't be pestering you about the dome anymore. You can continue your design work in this hut of yours, competing with Catch, and everybody lives happily ever after.
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]Why are you anxious?
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]What are you anxious about?
