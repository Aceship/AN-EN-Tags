[name="Yogi"]No, Yota, it's 'manufacturing.' Besides, you should try to get some more rest instead of helping out with work on the... uh... 'Forest Mk. III,' the fully-automatic tree planting and cutting robot.

[name="Eunectes"]Huh?!
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#2$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] Yeah, forget all that junk. Don't need it. The moment I picked up this axe, I figured it all out.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#2$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Figured what out...?
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#3$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] That this guy's all I need.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#3$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] Did you make it?
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#3$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#1", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]It was a rush order.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] I knew it. Only you could make something this kick-ass. No complaints. From the balance to the weight, all perfect.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] But this little ornament...

[name="Eunectes"]Lancet-2 told me to pour my feelings into everything I contribute to, whether a patient or equipment.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#3$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] She said that, huh? Probably learned it from Closure. Well, whatever winds your sprocket.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] Alright then, let's go!
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]...Gavial!
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] What now, more dawdling?
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]What... are you going to do? It sounds like the Durins' call for help that Tomimi got might be some kind of crisis their city is facing.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]It might be a Catastrophe... It might be war.

[name="Gavial"] The letter says 'fire rained down from the sky and burned our quilts' and 'a giant mushroom sprouted from the ground and blocked the sunlight, preventing the plants from growing,' but it's all too abstract.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] No matter what the problem is, we oughta be able to tackle it. I mean, Inam and Elysium are coming too.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#1", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Tackle it how?
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] Didn't you just give me the answer? Check out my getup. I really mean it, Zumama. I haven't been this excited in a while.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]So you mean you're using your fists again.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#3$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] Hah, the usual!
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#3$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]The usual, huh...
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] Time waits for no one, Zumama.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#3$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"] Don't you want to see with your own eyes what those guys from your tribe have done to the forest?
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#3$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Hah... I guess so.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#3$1", name2="char_416_zumama_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Let's get going, then.
