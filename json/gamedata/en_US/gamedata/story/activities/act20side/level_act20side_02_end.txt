Some weirdos at Rhodes Island can't seem to get enough of this sensation. Don't understand them at all.

You solve a problem by finding the bad guy and beating him down. Nice and simple, right?

[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1")]
[name="Gavial"]So you're the Durin.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] While I was in Acahualla, your name was on everyone's lips, Gavial.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Then tell me, what exactly is this crisis that Zeruertza faces, and how will it affect Acahualla?
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#2$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] That... To be honest, is an extremely complicated question, involving multiple layers including geography, geology, sociology, and more.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Let's start peeling back those layers.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#5$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] The most difficult part is, we can't discuss this topic without delving a little bit into literature first...
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#7$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] Like Tomimi, I also borrowed a few 'rhetorical' tricks.
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]In other words, what you told us was an exaggeration?
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#6$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] I wouldn't call it an exaggeration. I just, uh, was looking at things from a more macro-historical level.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#6$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] As Terra's crust changes over millions of years, there is indeed a high probability that the entire rainforest will sink into the ground...
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#2$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Can I beat the snot out of this little runt?
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]By all means.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#4$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] Wait, wait, hold on! I truly do need your help though, and this matter is critically important to Zeruertza!
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#7$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] Let's look at this from a business standpoint! Surely you've seen it too — Durin technology will definitely come in handy in the rainforest!
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#8$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] The Acahuallans won't have to treasure a few discarded lathes!
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]Hmm, if you're telling the truth.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#8$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] I assure you, I'll answer any technical questions the people of Acahualla might have!
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#9$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] (*mutters*) Heh, assuming you can even understand my answers.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#8$1")]
[name="Gavial"]What was that?
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#10$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] I-I said, even if you don't understand at first, I'll try to explain things as best as I can.
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]Let's cut to the chase then. What exactly are you trying to do?
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] It's very simple. Help me convince the others to repair the railway bridge connecting the city. It was damaged in the last earthquake.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] That way, Zeruertza can relocate its Originium detection devices without tossing out this entire damned dome, and I can be free of the old man's constant nagging.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#8$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] By the way, feel free to blow up a certain oversized slide blocking the railway bridge. That'd be killing two fowlbeasts with one stone. No, three!
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#6$1")]
[name="Tomimi"]Mr. Stitch, why do you have to build an entire railway instead of just repairing the dome? It'd be a shame to blow up the slide!
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] Everyone voted to leave the hole there and build the Great Aquapit.
[name="Stitch Canvas"] Moreover, repairing the dome poses a series of esoteric technical problems which won't make sense to the likes of you!
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] As such, we have to hold a new referendum to get our plan approved!
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]I'd rather not. I like the slide myself, and it would be a damned shame to blow it up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]Given how handy you Durins are, why do you need us Acahuallans to help you fix the bridge?
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#2$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] Fine... there's no harm in telling you.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] As the designer who proposed the plan to rebuild the railway bridge, I will naturally be put in charge if the proposal passes.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#3$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] However! Have you seen the blueprint for the railway bridge? I saw it back when I was in school, and it couldn't deviate any more from my ultra-minimalist design philosophy!
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#3$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] That dense wiring! That ugly skeleton frame!
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#5$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] So, I slept through every single one of my railway bridge design classes.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1")]
[name="Gavial"]So... you have no idea how to build a railway bridge at all?
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#7$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] Though I hate to admit it, it is my one shortcoming.
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#1$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] That is why I am enlisting the aid of all skilled Acahuallans, subcontracting this important project to you!
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#9$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] So how about it? A flawless solution, wouldn't you say?
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#8$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Durin society must be incredibly tolerant to allow a little shit like him to live this long...
[Character(name="avg_4054_malist_1#3$1")]
[name="Stitch Canvas"] H-Hey! What do you mean by that?!
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#7$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Alright, since Zumama is here, she can probably fix up the bridge in no time.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#5$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Huh? Where'd she go?
