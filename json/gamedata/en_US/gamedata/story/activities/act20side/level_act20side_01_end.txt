[name="Inam"]You folks won't have to get all excited over a few bits of scrap metal anymore.
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=1)]
[name="Tomimi"]Inam... I didn't expect you to be such an upstanding Great Chief! I thought you'd just blow all your money in the city every day.
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]You brat. Is that how you think of me?
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]If Acahualla wants to develop, the most important thing it needs is money. Doesn't matter if it's Sargonian coins, Columbian bills, or Victorian pounds. We need them all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]But with Acahualla's current manufacturing output – some shoddy handmade products, a bit of unrefined ore, we barely have enough money for people to live decently, let alone think about getting rich.
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Luckily, you don't have to worry about how the city defines 'living decently.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]That said, there's a difference between money and wealth. Sitting on a stack of money doesn't accomplish anything, but once you get it into circulation, then it becomes 'wealth.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Acahualla is already on the up and up. But to become even better, it needs opportunity.
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]For example, a technological partnership with the Durins.
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#5$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=1)]
[name="Tomimi"]Hmm, this is a bit beyond me... All I know is, whenever I run into a problem, I throw some Arts at it! If that doesn't work, I can always whack it with my staff!
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=1)]
[name="Tomimi"]That's the 'Gavial's Will' way of life!
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Hahaha! Even after working with Rhodes Island for so long, you still can't leave your roots behind, huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]But, uhh, the best that I can do is some tinkering around the edges. For Acahualla to truly develop, we still need a 'leader.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=1)]
[name="Tomimi"]But Inam, aren't you already the Great Chief?
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]A leader is someone who can truly unite the Tiacauh. Am I gonna do that? A little too troublesome for me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]I'd rather go shopping in the city.
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#2")]
[name="Elysium"]I like the way you think! I'm quite fond of shopping myself, but nothing beats the great outdoors, *hic*!
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#1")]
[name="Elysium"]By the way, I haven't seen our little motor-mouthed friend for quite some time. Did he sneak off somewhere?
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=1)]
[name="Tomimi"]Seems like it...
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]I'd assume he went to set something up?
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Oh, right, but since we're right in front of the big water slide... It wouldn't hurt to enjoy our vacation first, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=1)]
[name="Tomimi"]I, I think the Yanese Operators at Rhodes Island have a saying for this! It goes something like... uhh, 'the host plans, and the guests follow'?
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=1)]
[name="Tomimi"]I think that means... Since the host isn't here, we can do whatever we want.
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#3")]
[name="Elysium"]*hic*! Well said! I'll drink again to that pearl of wisdom!
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#5")]
[name="Elysium"]Race you to the foot of the slide, my friends!
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_075", focus=1)]
[name="Tomimi"]Elysium really is getting used to the Durin lifestyle a bit too quickly...
