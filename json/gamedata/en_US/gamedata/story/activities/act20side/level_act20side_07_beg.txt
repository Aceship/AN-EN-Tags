[name="Croque Diamondface"]Anywho, our cities don't move. Unnomadic, if you will.

[Character(name="avg_npc_566_1#2$1")]

[name="Croque Diamondface"]And if we're going to face up to that reality, then there's something we have to consider.
[name="Croque Diamondface"]A city's inhabitants leave it because of calamity, but calamity doesn't last forever. There'll be other Durins, maybe even our own offspring and theirs, who'll come upon that same land once again.
[name="Croque Diamondface"]They'll see the city's remains, they'll lament the disaster that befell it, but as the people who once lived and breathed in it, is that really all we want them to come and learn?
[name="Croque Diamondface"]Is surrender our only choice, in the face of our inescapable fate?
[name="Croque Diamondface"]We don't accept that. We choose—
[Character(name="avg_npc_566_1#6$1")]
[name="Croque Diamondface"]We decide, before calamity strikes, what shape our city is going to greet its ruin in.
[name="Croque Diamondface"]We set out to make our progeny marvel at the fruits of our technology, to make them gasp at the traces we've left behind, to make them toast with their finest tipple to all our achievements.
[name="Croque Diamondface"]Just as we find other fallen cities, and do the very same.
[name="Croque Diamondface"]Of course we're sad to have to leave where we grew, but it's a sadness we're accustomed to.
[Character(name="avg_npc_566_1#8$1")]
[name="Croque Diamondface"]And in said times for us, upkeeping our city such that it's in best condition becomes more meaningful than ever, doesn't it?
[name="Croque Diamondface"]It's the body. It's what we call dressing our doomed city.
[Character(name="avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]It's such a... romantic notion.
[Character(name="avg_npc_566_1#8$1")]
[name="Croque Diamondface"]Of course it is. The more straightforward reason is, we can build a brand new city in as quickly a few months, provided we bring the key industrial equipment and have our robots assisting.

[name="Avdotya"]......
[name="Avdotya"]My family all died in a noble conflict that had absolutely no honor to speak of, and I was forced to flee from my home.
[name="Avdotya"]Assassins trailed me throughout my escape, until I eventually fled into a cavern.
[name="Avdotya"]Its structure was as complex as the one above the lift here, and I happened to find such a lift that led underground.
[name="Avdotya"]And that's how I had the fortune to survive. It was that simple.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#7$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Oh, that sure was pretty lucky.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#4$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]Do you have no other thoughts?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#4$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Were you hoping for any?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#7$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]...*sigh* No wonder you're a friend of Gavial's.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#7$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]I've heard a lot of stories similar to yours aboard Rhodes Island.
[name="Eunectes"]You're already lucky enough just to have survived.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#7$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Zeruertza's a good place. It'd be pretty nice, living somewhere like this.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]It is.
[name="Avdotya"]I thought, originally, I'd be a lot angrier about the circumstances I'd landed in.
[name="Avdotya"]But had my family really been so guiltless, my parents so benevolent in their day-to-day, simply befallen by wicked men's hate?
[name="Avdotya"]Of course not.
[name="Avdotya"]My father still cursed his antagonists more than he cared for his own family, right until his final moments.
[name="Avdotya"]As I fled out from the back of our home, I knew nothing of even the whereabouts of my mother.
[name="Avdotya"]And I—I was no more than an insignificant sacrifice in a sea of Ursus noble conspiracy.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]You're right, I'm very lucky. That's why I have to cherish this hard-won luck as well as I can.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]For sure.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]......
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]You're cruising to pick a huge argument with Gavial, am I right?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#4$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]What gives you that idea?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#4$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Because she might've talked you over, but thinking about it carefully, you never actually said what you really wanted to say.
[name="Eunectes"]And you tried to argue with her again, but then you lost the opportunity, so your only choice was to bite your tongue.
[name="Eunectes"]I've seen a lot of people pissed off by Gavial's whole personality—she gets me too, sometimes—and you're the most obvious kind about it.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]Alright, I admit it.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]I've never met anyone like Gavial. Whether I'm Ursus or Durin, getting a handle on her is... elusive.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]If there's something you need to get off your mind, you can tell me. You've helped me out. I'll think about passing it onto her for you.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]I'll refrain. I'm not in straits that desperate yet.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]However, I do have a proposal.
[name="Avdotya"]I have no plans to formally make a return to surface life.
[name="Avdotya"]Once the danger is past, I'll be proposing the Durins return underground.
[name="Avdotya"]Of course, contact can never be easily severed once made, and so breaking off dealings will be nigh-impossible. I recognize that much.
[name="Avdotya"]And I admit that you, the Tiacauh of Acahualla, may be possible relational targets.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#10$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]Thus, once the Durins rebuild their city underground, I'll invite you all to relocate from a rainforest void of anything, to the land beneath the surface.
[name="Avdotya"]At that point, I'm sure even one of Gavial's nature will understand just how wonderful Durin society is.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#10$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Hmm... yeah, we'll pass.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]Why?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#6$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Let's get back to that once we find the map.
