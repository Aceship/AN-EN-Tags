[name="Croque Diamondface"]The Acahuallans dance around a Metal Crab without sleep or rest, and the last one standing becomes the Great Chief. Isn't that right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_075",name2="avg_npc_566_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Inam"]Where did you hear that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_075",name2="avg_npc_566_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Croque Diamondface"]I read it in 'Stranger Things.' It's the most popular periodical in Zeruertza. Back in the day, a great adventurer brought a whole big set down from the surface. It's basically our encyclopedia of the surface world.
[Character(name="avg_npc_075",name2="avg_npc_566_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Inam"]That's just a lousy tabloid!
[Character(name="avg_npc_075",name2="avg_npc_566_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Croque Diamondface"]Surely you're mistaken... You have no idea how diligently I studied Sargonian to be able to read those books.

[Character(name="avg_npc_075",name2="avg_npc_566_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Croque Diamondface"]The most recent ones? There are sequels to those books?! Hmm... If you really could procure those, then maybe I could consider it...
