[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1")]

[name="Inam"]This survey equipment has to get across, right? I came to help since I didn't have anything else to do.

[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#4",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]And I've been trying to find a date for Lancet-2.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#4",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Lancet-2 is the robot that came with Rhodes Island, right?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]Yes, she's my big sister now.
[name="Eunectes"]I'm not skilled enough to make a robot as smart as Lancet-2, so I'm trying to find one in this group.

[name="Announcement From Afar"]How far until goal? 300m? Ah, forget it.
[name="Announcement From Afar"]What's really important is that the architect Stitch Canvas, the only student of Master Finch, has found a boat and jumped into the race!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]Oh? Looks like he's talking to us. Let's zoom in and see what he's saying...
[name="Announcement From Afar"]'I'm gonna win,' I think. Yup, I'm sure that's it.
[name="Announcement From Afar"]And he just raised his middle finger to show his motivation. Looks like there's a fiery heart beneath this architect's cold surface!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]He may have gotten a late start, but that vehicle is definitely a huge advantage.
[name="Announcement From Afar"]He's closing the distance as we speak!
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#4",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Things are pretty lively over there.
[name="Inam"]I wanted to say that this is what happens with Gavial around, but she's not the only one who's let her hair down.

[name="Eunectes"]You're not used to it?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]You have to get used to it, living in Acahualla.
[name="Inam"]You get so used to it I feel weird if there's no one arguing and making noise around me.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]You're a proper Tiacauh now.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Of course I am.
[name="Inam"]Speaking of which, Zumama, if Gavial didn't come back last year, you were planning to become the Great Chief of Acahualla, weren't you?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]Becoming Great Chief wasn't the real goal; it was a way for me to prove myself.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#5",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]I wanted to build the most powerful machine ever.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#5",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]I knew I shouldn't have placed any expectations on you.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#4",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]Are you thinking about being lord ameer?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#4",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Good to see that you and Tomimi have learned something about politics, unlike Gavial.
[name="Inam"]I don't know how she's survived on the outside all these years.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]Some things we deal with as a matter of course just don't factor in for Gavial. Like adapting to your environment.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Haha, that's true.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]So you want her to become lord ameer? Are you sure she's suitable?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Pretty sure you could pick somebody off any street in Sargon and get a better lord ameer than her.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]Agreed.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]But if we're choosing a Tiacauh to lead Acahualla, there's no one more suitable than her.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]Are you speaking as a Tiacauh, or as a Sargon Messenger?

[name="Announcement From Afar"]We're entering the final stretch of the race!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]Gavial remains in first place, but her lead continues to shrink.
[name="Announcement From Afar"]It's not Avdotya who's closing the distance, though!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]Despite her valiant effort, her choice of clothing has become dead weight.
[name="Announcement From Afar"]Literally, as the weight of her clothes is slowing her down!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]Meanwhile, Elysium is rapidly closing in!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]Conserving his strength in the first half, Elysium now shows off his true ability.
[name="Announcement From Afar"]He has passed Avdotya and is almost neck-and-neck with Gavial!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]However—
[name="Announcement From Afar"]Neither of them are aware of the true threat approaching!
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]I'm impressed with Elysium. I never thought he could catch up to Gavial.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]His attitude is a mask. You can't get complacent.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Yes, I noticed. He doesn't want people to know how good he is.

[name="Eunectes"]Don't change the subject.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Alright, looks like you've learned a thing or two at Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#3",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]Not on purpose, but Master Closure makes me go to meetings about stuff besides technology, so I've heard a bunch of things.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#3",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Looks like she has high hopes for you.
[name="Inam"]As for your question...
[name="Inam"]I've lived in Acahualla for a long time.
[name="Inam"]Compared to city life, I prefer to stay in the jungles, watching you people fight over stupid things.
[name="Inam"]Maybe it's hard to believe, but for me, I'm a Tiacauh a Sargon Messenger at the same time. I don't have to pick.
[name="Inam"]Or I guess I could say, my Sargon perspective tells me that Acahualla won't stay unexplored forever. That's why I hope you'll seize the opportunity.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]I believe you.

[name="Announcement From Afar"]Exercising his explosive potential, Elysium has almost caught up to Gavial.
[name="Announcement From Afar"]Avdotya's not out of this race yet, though, and she's still keeping pace with the two in front of her.
[name="Announcement From Afar"]No need to push it, Avdotya!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]But now all three of them have noticed the threat approaching from behind—Stitch, riding in his boat!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]The wonders of machinery! He has caught up to the three in front of him in a very short period of time!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]Only a hundred meters to the goal!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]It's like we're at the starting line again. Three swimmers and a boat, racing their way into the final stretch!
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]But, Inam.
[name="Eunectes"]I won't help you convince her.
[name="Eunectes"]Gavial should not sit in that chair.
[name="Eunectes"]You'll get the same answer if you ask Tomimi.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#2",name2="avg_npc_075",focus=2)]
[name="Inam"]Why?

[name="Announcement From Afar"]Fifty meters!
[name="Announcement From Afar"]Elysium tries to board the boat, but took an accidental hit from Master Edge, who is angry at Stitch, and falls back into the water!
