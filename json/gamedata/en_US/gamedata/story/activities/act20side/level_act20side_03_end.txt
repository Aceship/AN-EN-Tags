[name="Durin Passerby"]Hello, allow me to introduce myself. I am Deculture Silvermint, the industry representative of Zeruertza.
[Character(name="avg_npc_569_1#8$1")]
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]And also administrator of the assistant robots.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1", name2="avg_npc_576_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]The administrator...
[Character(name="avg_npc_569_1#8$1")]
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]That's right. The assistant robots in Zeruertza are built, supervised, and governed by me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_569_1#1$1")]
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]Model R3-E3 Assistant Robot #0429, what are you doing here?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1", name2="avg_npc_576_1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Strange Machine #0429"]This unit, submitted a request to Zumama. Overhaul 0428.
[Character(name="avg_npc_569_1#1$1")]
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]0428 has already been retired. Now return to your post.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1", name2="avg_npc_576_1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Strange Machine #0429"]...Acknowledged. Executing directive.
[Character(name="avg_npc_569_1#1$1")]
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]Zumama, your communication with that assistant robot is pretty unusual, and its responses have been... abnormal.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1", name2="avg_npc_576_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]What's unusual about our communication?
[Character(name="avg_npc_569_1#10$1")]
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]I can't say for sure. Maybe what's unusual is... the communication itself?
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1", name2="avg_npc_576_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]You don't talk to the little fellas?
[Character(name="avg_npc_569_1#1$1")]
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]No... They were made just to work.
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#1", name2="avg_npc_576_1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Eunectes"]That's no good. I talk to my Lancet all the time. She's like a big sister to me, letting me lean up against her cold, metal shell, patting me on the shoulder with her robotic arm, singing to me with her beautiful synth...
[Character(name="avg_npc_569_1#4$1")]
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]...Huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_569_1#1$1")]
[name="Deculture Silvermint"]'Stranger Things' never mentioned anything like that.

[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1")]
[name="Tomimi"]And most importantly! Gavial helped me pick this out...
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1")]
[name="Tomimi"]The only thing that could be better is if Gavial bought a matching set with me!
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#4$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]Is she alright?
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Oh, yeah, it's fine. The kid's been like that ever since she was little.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]I've read that this obsessive hoarding behavior is called 'Zalak's Disease' in some places. It might be stress-induced or something.
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#4$1")]
[name="Tomimi"]No, no, I'm really happy! These memories are very precious to me!
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]Okay, if you say so.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1")]
[name="Gavial"]So, Avdotya, you have an Ursus name. Is that where you came from originally?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]My name is Avdotya Razorpen. A standard Durin name.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1")]
[name="Gavial"]But, Avdotya is still Ursine.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]What are you getting at?
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Calm down, I'm just making small talk.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#8$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]No... that place is not my home. I just happened to come from there.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#2$1")]
[name="Gavial"]What I really don't understand is why you're so paranoid about the surface.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]......
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]When I was little, I loved spending time with the grammar tutor my parents hired for me. Though she could be a bit dry, she sometimes said really interesting things.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]Ursus has a lot of literature describing one's hometown, and my tutor was always entranced by those works. We would analyze their motifs, their composition styles...
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]Back then, I thought everyone would grow nostalgic for their hometown, and people who traveled far away would eventually find their way back to slumber eternally...
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]But I later found out that's not true at all. If all the memories you have of your hometown are painful ones, and you find a place more suitable to be your home, then why should you yearn for a place you once were?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#2$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]It is no different from another stop on a long journey.
[Character(name="avg_npc_572_1#1$1")]
[name="Tomimi"]Miss Avdotya, what made you decide to leave Ursus?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]...I don't want to talk about it.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#8$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]Things that would make you vomit. My status, my family, my friends, all vanished overnight. I fled with my tail between my legs, quite literally.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1")]
[name="Gavial"]From Ursus, to Sargon, to an underground Durin city... Your journey couldn't have been easy.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]How could there be a journey with no destination?
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]I just happened to get lucky. I finally found this place, a small city called Zeruertza.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]The Durins here accepted me, and I will repay the debt with even greater kindness.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]This is the place I've decided I belong.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#8$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]And that's why I won't let anything harm them. I don't care if it's out of malice, or out of good intentions gone awry.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]That is my warning to you.
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1")]
[name="Gavial"]Alright...
[Character(name="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1")]
[name="Gavial"]I was going to ask you to have a drink, just as a show of goodwill. But maybe not––
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]
[name="Avdotya"]Wait.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1")]

[name="Gavial"]To be honest, I'm not much of a psychologist. There are a lot of things I don't understand about the human heart, and I don't really care to understand it. It's already hard enough patching up the body.

[name="Gavial"]I overheard you talking with some of those Durin shopkeepers. The gist I got was that the stories you wrote about snowfields didn't seem to strike the right note with them.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#9$1", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]That's right... They have neither snow nor fields underground.

[name="Avdotya"]Just to be clear, I don't write like that because I miss being there. It's nothing more than... a plot of land for a story to take place on.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]You know that there's a story to be told there. That by itself isn't Durin.

[name="Avdotya"]But that won't stop me from trying.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#8$1", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#10$1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]Even if you just be yourself, the Durins will still accept you.

[name="Gavial"]Fine.
[Character(name="avg_4055_bgsnow_1#1$1", name2="avg_1026_gvial2_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Avdotya"]Sure, the Durins are always happy to accept anyone they meet. This time, it was you people, and me. What about next time?

[name="Avdotya"]Since you are a doctor, you must have seen the evil lurking in men's hearts. You've surely seen the depravity to which people will stoop in order to hurt one another.

[name="Avdotya"]I won't act like this is a racial issue. Everything on the surface has shaped us into this. All too quick to resort to violence, lusting after power and money, blinded by ambition...
