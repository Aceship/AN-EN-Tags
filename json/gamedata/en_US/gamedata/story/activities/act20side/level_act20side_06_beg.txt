Stitch opens his eyes, and sees two familiar figures.
[name="Croque Diamondface"]Avdotya, I've got your fresh change of clothes here.
[name="Avdotya"]Thank you.
[name="Avdotya"]Also, Croque, drink a little less in future, to be on the safe side.
[name="Croque Diamondface"]Ahahah, sorry, sorry. All's well that ends well, though, wouldn't you say?
[name="Avdotya"]No, I still don't see anything 'well' about this...
[name="Avdotya"]In the meantime, I suppose I'll find somewhere to change.
With that, the two of them notice Stitch has come to.
[name="Avdotya"]*sigh* Good morning, Stitch.
[name="Stitch Canvas"]What happened to me?
[name="Avdotya"]Do you still remember how you fainted?
[name="Stitch Canvas"]I was steering the boat, and then old Edge came running over, and then... oof, my head...
[name="Avdotya"]And then the boat went out of control, crashed against the shore, and flung the two of you out.
[name="Stitch Canvas"]And how about Master Edge?
[name="Avdotya"]He woke up before you, and he's taken Elysium with him to survey for now.
[name="Stitch Canvas"]Wait, the gear on the boat!
[PlaySound(key="$e_atk_saw_n_2",volume=0.2)]
[name="Avdotya"]The equipment's all essentially wrecked. As for the survey gear... we had Deculture make that on the fly.

[PlaySound(key="$d_avg_rockfall",volume=0.2,delay=0.5)]
And with her prompting, it finally hits Stitch that the persistent racket isn't just nature. Is that a mixture of a chainsaw's roar and collapsing rock?

Gazing all around, Stitch sees numerous fragments of extremely orderly cut rock, as well as a tunnel wide enough to fit two side by side.
The fine work of Gavial, without a doubt.
Which is to say, deprived of all the cutting equipment, Gavial opened a way through to the tunnel all by her singular self.
Stitch can't help but begin to suspect that the rumors he heard from the Acahuallan tribes, all those legends of the invincible Gavial, were at least partly founded in reality.

After having drilled through the cave-in, everyone enters the tunnel itself.
The space inside is more of a cave than a tunnel in reality, both vast and profoundly deep.
Nevertheless, Elysium is more than up to the task, and everyone proceeds through smoothly with him leading the way.
So smoothly, in fact, that it piques their curiosities that he could grasp the tunnel's structure in such a short time; there's even suspicion he's been this way before.
However, that idea, more a joke than anything, pales in comparison to the hesitance at the sight that greets them where Elysium comes to a halt.
It is a vein of Originium, exposed on the surface of the strata.
Moreover, anyone with some knowledge of Originium could easily tell that this vein has been active for a very, very long time.
And activity means—
Explosion.
Or put less kindly—
Disaster.

[name="Broadcast"]The results of this survey are not optimistic.
[name="Broadcast"]Master Edge has discovered an Originium vein in the tunnel, located approximately one kilometer from the city.
[name="Broadcast"]We tentatively speculate this Originium vein's existence was known at the time of Zeruertza's founding, in a stratum approximately three kilometers out.
[name="Broadcast"]However, tectonic shift originating in the earthquake half a year ago caused this vein to warp and extend closer to our city, and kickstarted its activation in the process.
[name="Broadcast"]Currently, Master Edge is leading experts to urgently evaluate this Originium vein's level of activity, and thus determine at what point in the future it will explode.
[name="Broadcast"]We will provide further updates once accurate conclusions can be drawn.
[name="Broadcast"]As of now, we ask all residents to be prepared to evacuate.
