[character(name="avg_npc_184")]
[name="Bishop"]Nonsense.
[name="Bishop"]As the sea's most faithful creation, there is nary an ounce of falsehood to my position.
[name="Bishop"]I stand here because I wish to save them from the bottom of my heart. Without me, they would long have become a pile of rotten meat strewn across these lands.
[name="Bishop"]Disease and starvation. As long as we can fight against these tangible enemies, they are not our most difficult hardships. Our most difficult hardships come from the deepest parts of our souls.
[name="Bishop"]When we find ourselves unable to fight these disasters, with destruction unavoidable, that is when we are faced with true hardship.
[name="Bishop"]How many towns like this are still standing in Iberia?
[name="Bishop"]This country's vast territory has long been unable to fulfill its people's needs. Nonetheless, they remain in their cramped flesh, either isolating themselves from one another or brawling.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1",name2="avg_npc_184",focus=1)]

[name="Bishop"]You are wrong again. It is the suffering of the people that I care about, not the borders arbitrarily drawn on these lands.
[name="Bishop"]Isn't this in the nature of us all?
[name="Bishop"]Bound by the limitations of our flesh and blood, it's difficult for us to break away from our obsession with ourselves by our own means, and so we choose to fight, not to understand.
[name="Bishop"]If this goes on, even the strongest of individuals cannot escape defeat. Hardships engulf every corner. You have seen it yourself and wavered at the sight of that misery.

[name="Gladiia"]Well, your way with words is on another level. It's no wonder so many have found themselves enthralled by your words.
[character(name="avg_npc_184")]
[name="Bishop"]You do not yet understand. I am most sincere. I ask nothing from them. I do not believe in the power of threats either. I simply wish to point them toward a new possibility.
[name="Bishop"]Their bodies' weakness will forever limit their cognition. You think I am ensnaring their souls with words, but the truth is far from it.
[name="Bishop"]I am helping their hearts to hear the most basic needs of their bodies. The teachings of sages can bring nothing but brief, blind faith. The strength of the body is what grants them the right to see more.
[name="Bishop"]There are creatures in the sea. They have no eyes, their bodies are miniscule, and they have no means of mobility. They can only drift with the tides.
[name="Bishop"]Is the ocean that they see so different than what we see? How do creatures with no eyes grasp the holiness and profoundness of the sea?
[name="Bishop"]You and your colleagues never understood how and where your vile yet sturdy bodies came to be, nor can you see how the weak struggle.
[name="Bishop"]Who, then, is the truly arrogant?
[name="Bishop"]Is it me, despite the fact I am helping them, or is it those believers of false gods, who, as the perils grow ever greater, use their words to turn true despair into false hope, to deceive and to control the pitiable weak?
[name="Bishop"]Or perhapsâ€”It's you and your foolish cohorts, who remain ever unwilling to face the vast sea bottoms?
[name="Bishop"]I am sharing with them what my eyes can see so that they may broaden their horizons and know they still have true hope. They may choose for themselves whether they will rot with the land or be reborn as one with the sea.
[name="Bishop"]Not only can this possibility save them from starvation and disease, it is also the sea's generosity for the land that insists on consuming.
[name="Bishop"]This is not a conquest. It's understanding. It's acceptance.
[name="Bishop"]I am pointing them in a new direction and giving them a better life. In the end, they will walk toward the truth, just as I once did.
[name="Bishop"]This is my life's work. Your false flesh has confined your soul and left you short-sighted. You cannot see true greatness. You shall be forgiven.
