The bishop's skull cracks open between his eyes.
His eyelids break off from his large eyeballs. The hunters' retreat is reflected in the glass objects that lie there.
Countless tentacles quickly bulge out from what had been its slender, frail body. They then swipe at these insects that it had once only ridiculed.
Seawater begins to fill the cave, just as the bishop's body continues to expand.
The bishop's wriggling destroys all of the equipment in its vicinity. Its body is no different than that of the Seaborn, yet the anger it exudes is undoubtedly human.

The tentacles reach upwards, crushing all the falling rocks into dust. The gravels collide into the surrounding walls and cause them to fissure.
Specter's saw is rumbling, and the moment the tentacles draw near her, a smirk appears on her face.
[name="Specter"]I wonder how long it has been since I had to take on a prey like you? This is becoming delightful.
Specter swings her saw in one horizontal stroke, striking it on the wall. A huge hole appears in the granite rockface.
She uses the momentum to flip herself up. At the same time, the saw traces a grayish path beneath her that intersects a tentacle.
A sharp slicing sound rings through the air, slicing the tentacle in two.
With her hair fluttering in the air, the 'nun' grabs what had been a part of the stairs and pushes before continuing her dash toward the chapel.
She gazes at the cross section of the tentacle. A few tiny spores are bulging out of that translucent white area.
[name="Specter"]Do you hear that? Its cells are screaming just like us.
[name="Skadi"]It has emotions. It used to be an Ægir... No. No more, and it could hardly be called one before.
Suddenly, the tip of its severed tentacle releases the spores, and several sharp-edged streams of liquid gush out toward the hunters.
Skadi flips her sword and presses the blade against her body as a shield.

The three liquid streams hit the blade, pushing Skadi back by several meters. The liquid splashes onto the rockface nearby, boring a few small holes before evaporating.
[name="Skadi"]The pressure's even higher than the waterjet on my workbench.
[name="Specter"]It's looking at us.

A hard membrane layer immediately covers the monster's eyes. The lance's tip leaves a long trail of scar on the membrane.
She then leaps upward as the monster howls in vexation below.
The hunters are almost there to the bottom of the building; the chapel's floor has already crumbled away during their fierce battle. There are only a few seconds left until they make it to the top.
However, Gladiia slows down.
