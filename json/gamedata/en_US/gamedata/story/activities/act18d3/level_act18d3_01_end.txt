[name="Old José"]Several years have come and gone. Here I thought you'd folded, seeing as you went through plenty of Kazimierz bounty hunters. This far out from Kazimierz, and I could still hear word of what you'd been up to.
[name="Old José"]Always thought you only knew how to make big ruckuses.
[name="Old José"]But you've been quiet as this now.
[name="Old José"]You came roadrollering in all the way from Minos country like a tow truck, just to find me? Go on, then, tell me what you want.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]I need to get to Sal Viento.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]Sal... Viento?
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]Don't tell me. Even you've never heard of the place?
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]No, I've heard. Out of all us information peddlers, only I must've heard. The question's you—what makes you want to go there?
[name="Old José"]There's nothing there anymore. Few decades ago... close to nothing left after.
[name="Old José"]So close to such a vast patch of ocean, and you think anything'd be left? No better than bare frames left, letting the wind and all through.
[name="Old José"]Many bounty hunters wanting to get up to those abandoned cities, just like beastlings pouncing on a rotting burdenbeast corpse.
[name="Old José"]All of them thinking there's still meat they can pick off. They don't know whatever they swallow there might as well be a batch of poison.
[name="Old José"]Iberia. All of them think this unspeaking Iberia's just like Kazimierz and Gaul, treasure all over the map.
[name="Old José"]Hah, there's nothing there at all. When a place has nothing at all, it's likelier than all it could have anything.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]So do you tell those bounty hunters anything?
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]If they ask me to sell info, I'll sell it. As far as ones like me go, whether those folks come back or don't, it's all business.
[name="Old José"]Fact is, they don't come back at all. Not one ever comes back.
[name="Old José"]Two weeks ago, a team came to me. Lackeys of the 'Daggerhorn.'
[name="Old José"]He had equipment leagues better than all these runts lying around. Very experienced too. Brought more than ten with him. Still haven't seen them again yet.
[name="Old José"]Very many wonder about where they went. They could've been caught by the Penal Battalion, or it could've been the Iberian Defensa's doing, but I've heard tell of a different possibility.
[name="Old José"]Over there be... monsters.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]Oh.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]Or it was the Inquisition that got 'em. I don't know what's a more wretched end.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]Monsters or people, my sword draws little distinction. There are only those who block my way, and those who don't.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]Alright, alright. You can't be going to Sal Viento for a holiday, that much's for sure.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]

[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]What poor bastard has your wrath this time?
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]This time's different. It's my... It's someone I knew from before.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]Before you even knew me?
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]Much before.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]Here I thought they'd all left. Or died. At least, that's what you told me back in those days.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]That's why I'm searching. There's a few things I need to figure out.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]You've been searching for quite some years, yeah?
[name="Old José"]That whole ruckus from last time couldn't have been for any knights' treasure's sakes.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]You told me before. People ought to move forward.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]—
[name="Old José"]Did you bring a treasure map with you?
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]What?
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]There're many, some of them even old hands. They travel the barrens, traveling and traveling, and forget where they wanted to go, or what they were even looking for.
[name="Old José"]They just keep on traveling. They don't know starvation, they don't know exhaustion.
[name="Old José"]Until the barrenlands do them in.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]They were too weak.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]Weak? No matter how much stronger, a hunter could still never conquer the boundless barrenlands. So many hunters die for no sure reason out on the road, and don't even know what they're searching for come their deaths—that's not an ending that suits you.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]Why are you telling me all this?
[name="Skadi"]As if I've never told you before? They wouldn't rival even the tiniest Ægir machine.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]You're strong. So did you save my son's life?
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]I'm sorry.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]Don't say sorry! I'm not trying to flog you here. I'm trying to get you thinking. It's you who hasn't forgiven yourself, not me.
[name="Old José"]I only regret that I didn't break his legs, stop him following an old papá in his old tracks. Nothing to do with you.
[name="Old José"]You say you came from the sea. I've never heard of any other sea than the one in Iberia. You're someone I don't know.
[name="Old José"]So what about you? Is there no one you don't know?
[name="Old José"]Because that's the kind that killed my son. Someone you don't even know.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]That's the sort of thing I'm afraid of.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]
[name="Old José"]Never mind it. At least the people you talk about wouldn't spend day and night plotting to kill me. What are you thinking of doing in Sal Viento?
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]
[name="Skadi"]I have a friend who's been taken there.
[character(name="avg_npc_181")]

[name="Old José"]Take this. Map.
[character(name="char_263_skadi#3")]

[name="Old José"]Give me?

[name="Old José"]And how much time are you ready to waste on them? How much longer can the person you're looking for wait? Iberians aren't like these lousy bounty hunters. They're not that easy to break clean of.
