[character(name="avg_npc_182#3")]
[name="Inquisitor"]They're all gone without a trace, as if they never were. If I didn't see them clearly with my own eyes, I would've thought this all a dream.
[name="Inquisitor"]These monsters... the Sea Terrors. I've come across them plenty of times before. They don't look that much like these ones, but they have that same disgusting stench.
[name="Inquisitor"]But that was on the beach, and they never show up in such numbers. Do you mean to tell me they do not actually live in the sea?
[name="Inquisitor"]They only show up when someone goes look for trouble at the shore, right? Just like what you were doing during the day.
[name="Inquisitor"]And now they came this far away from the beach. They've nearly made it to the streets.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#5")]
[name="Skadi"]They can make it far more places than you can imagine. They can spread by changing form, permeating every corner of the world.

[name="Inquisitor"]You may have given me an answer now, but that doesn't mean my judgment has changed.
[name="Inquisitor"]You don't belong to this city. A person like you showing up is a mistake.
[name="Inquisitor"]Not to mention... You told me yourself you brought this disaster with you.
[name="Inquisitor"]—It's certainly not how I imagined it, though.
[character(name="avg_npc_182#3")]
[name="Inquisitor"]Nonetheless, Ægir. You are dangerous. You are a danger to this city. At the same time, this city is also a danger to you.

[name="Skadi"]Hm?
[character(name="avg_npc_182#2")]
[name="Inquisitor"]Look at them. They are... eating scraps of the Sea Terrors' remains. They don't fear these monsters... No, they don't even know what monsters are.
[name="Inquisitor"]They feed when they are hungry. As a monster does. And humans... humans know what fear is.
[character(name="avg_npc_182#3")]
[name="Inquisitor"]So... Are they still human?
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1")]
[name="Skadi"]All I know is that they're trying their best to live.
[name="Skadi"]From that perspective, there's nothing that sets humans and monsters apart.
[character(name="avg_npc_182#2")]
[name="Inquisitor"]When they live like that... can you really say they are alive?
[name="Inquisitor"]The High Inquisitor told me to see it for myself, and only now do I understand what he meant.
[name="Inquisitor"]In this city, the biggest problem isn't whatever its citizens are doing. It's that they are still alive in this manner—This is the most abnormal thing of all.
[name="Inquisitor"]Like you, they are dangerous, and this danger must be kept under control, just like how mistakes must be corrected.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1")]
[name="Skadi"]You haven't given up.
[character(name="avg_npc_182#3")]
[name="Inquisitor"]Now I really can't let you go.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#7")]
[name="Skadi"]I already told you. I still have something to take care of, and I am in a hurry.
[character(name="avg_npc_182#3")]

[name="Inquisitor"]Ægir, I know you are hurt, and you must be exhausted after fighting the Sea Terrors.

[name="Old Inhabitant"]You brought your bad guys away, but did that improve our lives?
[character(name="avg_npc_182#2")]
[name="Inquisitor"]When you remove all the factors that bring chaos to society in time, there will naturally be order.
[character(name="avg_npc_179#1")]
[name="Old Inhabitant"]Yet there is less and less food to go by... Those of us who got on in years either die of hunger or disease. Even some of our young couldn't endure.
[name="Old Inhabitant"]You speak of order... but all you want is for us to die quietly, isn't it? That way, there will be no more noise, and you upper class folks can finally lie down on your fluffy beds for a quiet night of sleep.
[character(name="avg_npc_182#3")]
[name="Inquisitor"]That's not it.
[name="Inquisitor"]All of Iberia is suffering. Not just you.
[name="Inquisitor"]Shouldn't a criminal who steals resources and harms the people be stopped? Suppose there are ten meals before us. They should feed ten Iberians.
[name="Inquisitor"]If no one is there to tell them how much they should get, they will fight to no end. In the end, only one of the ten will remain.
[name="Inquisitor"]The Inquisition draws the boundary of right and wrong amid this chaos and guides the masses to the right path. Otherwise the whole country would've long become a heap of sand.
[character(name="avg_npc_179#1")]
[name="Old Inhabitant"]Everything you said... I don't get it, and it's nothing I can see.
[name="Old Inhabitant"]We don't have a way out. When we truly wanted one, where were you?
[character(name="avg_npc_182#2")]
[name="Inquisitor"]I... I want to help you. I am working hard to become a full-fledged Inquisitor. I took this path because I want to help the people, and I trust that this is the only way.
[character(name="avg_npc_179#1")]
[name="Old Inhabitant"]Help us...?
[name="Old Inhabitant"]I hoped, imagined, thirsted, even dreamt of someone coming to save us. I screamed through so many nights till my throat was hoarse.
[name="Old Inhabitant"]You never came.
[name="Old Inhabitant"]Will you Inquisitors only come when someone has done something wrong?
[name="Old Inhabitant"]Look at these old bones. I never imagined I'd live this long. What a tragedy. Every day is filled with nothing but pain.
