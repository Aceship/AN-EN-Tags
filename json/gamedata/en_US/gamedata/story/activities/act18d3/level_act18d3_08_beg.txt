[name="Bishop"]Mixed-breeds... You mixed-breeds!
[name="Bishop"]Herald! What's the meaning of this?! Why are they still alive? What of theirs is worth sparing?!
[name="Bishop"]You must have realized they were nothing like you when first they slaughtered our bloodkin!
[name="Bishop"]You are a holy being, and they are mere filth!
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]*Spit*...
[name="Gladiia"]Very flexible, eh?
[name="Gladiia"]We hacked away at your kind with cold weapons so as to not expose you to our technology. That way, you will never become something we can't deal with.
[name="Gladiia"]But I guess I overestimated. You don't seem very sensitive at all... Can't even adjust to this much?
[name="Gladiia"]Looks like you just can't adapt to blades forged by Ægir technology. Am I right?

[name="Seaborn"](Low roar)
[name="Seaborn"]Ugh... (Cough)
[name="Seaborn"]Brother, why won't you accept them?
[name="Seaborn"]They are my sisters, and so they are your sisters too.
[name="Seaborn"]I can rouse you, rouse Ishar-mla, and, of course... Gla-dia too.
[name="Seaborn"]Just because your brothers swam for the shallow seas, you no longer recognize them as your brothers. You haven't looked back even once...
[name="Seaborn"]But our tribe cares.
[character(name="avg_npc_184")]
[name="Bishop"]No... This is nonsense...
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]So you believe every single word in that good book you're holding? Let me remind you, Bishop, but you, too, are spreading heresy in full view of the Iberians.
[name="Gladiia"]It doesn't matter to me one bit what this thing tells me, but you are from the Church of the Deep. Perhaps you should be taking notes?
[character(name="avg_npc_184")]
[name="Bishop"]Kill them... Kill them! Herald, do it! Their crimes are grave and unforgivable! They spout blasphemy against you and the sea!
[character(name="avg_npc_186")]
[name="Seaborn"]If that is your wish... then I shall do it.
[character(name="avg_npc_184")]
[name="Bishop"]It doesn't matter to you at all, does it? It doesn't matter if I ask this of you. You said so yourself! You will kill them!
[character(name="avg_npc_186")]
[name="Seaborn"]Yes, It doesn't matter to me.
[character(name="avg_npc_184")]
[name="Bishop"]Then kill the... wandering singer first. Kill the one in the red dress!
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]Trash. If I tell you to kill the person behind you, the bishop who's dressed like a strand of kelp, will you do it?

[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#3")]
[name="Gladiia"]Ah, humans.
[name="Gladiia"]Ægir are vile and hideous, aren't they? Admit it, Bishop.
[name="Gladiia"]We are all foolish Ægir, and we like to apply what we think to lowlife beasts. You don't understand it at all.

[name="Gladiia"]Well, if all you want is to protect us—Why not refuse?
[character(name="avg_npc_186")]
[name="Seaborn"]Refuse?
[name="Seaborn"]How do I... refuse?
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]Enough. Looks like you are indeed a lowlife. That's about as deep as you can swim.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#3")]
[name="Gladiia"]But listen up, Trash. I won't ask you to kill the weakling behind you.
[name="Gladiia"]You are prey. Who would beg prey to do something?
[name="Gladiia"]You want to hurt her? You will listen to his suggestion and kill Skadi, my hunter? You don't need that answer anymore, do you?
[character(name="avg_npc_186")]
[name="Seaborn"]I have other ways, even with her dead. As long as there's a way, it doesn't matter to me.
[name="Seaborn"]But you told me... to refuse...
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]Way too soon... *cough*...

[character(name="avg_npc_186")]
[name="Seaborn"]Now, Gla-dia.
[name="Seaborn"]Whether you get to live and whether your flesh will continue to function... This is for you to decide.
[character(name="avg_474_gladiia_1#5")]
[name="Gladiia"]And let us decide that by hunting each other.
[character(name="avg_npc_186")]
[name="Seaborn"]Each other... Each other. Yes. We will prey on each other. You will prey on me, and I will prey on you.
