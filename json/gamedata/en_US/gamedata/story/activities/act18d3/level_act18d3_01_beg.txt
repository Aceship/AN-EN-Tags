Yes.
One needs only lose one's home, and one is nothing at all.
Reason says that I, coming here, should have been able to begin a new life.
Except the past cannot be rid. These things follow your shadow and climb your shins, dragging you into the abyss of the swamp.
Not one of us can break free of the past.
If there comes a day, and your home has found you...

One of the fiercest hunters in all of Skadi's mind chooses, at this juncture, to say nothing.
In Skadi's heart, doubt burgeons.
[name="Skadi"]She's changed a lot. She may not necessarily recognize you now. Her body is still feeble.
[name="Gladiia"]Feeble? A hunter could not be feeble.
[name="Skadi"]How long have you been on dry land?
[name="Skadi"]Disease of the land, of a special kind, has hollowed her body out. The people aboard this ship can stabilize her condition.
[name="Skadi"]In all these years, she's never come back to sanity. The current Specter is another person entirely. I don't know what it was that made her like this.
Gladiia does not speak, and the breeze blows through, her hair drifting in its wakes, covering her eye.
Skadi has realized where the problem lies.
[name="Skadi"]Gladiia. Yes, you're Gladiia. There is no mistake. But what do you intend to do?
[name="Skadi"]Where are you planning to take her?
[name="Gladiia"]I believed that upon dry land, the hunters were free. Have I misunderstood something?
[name="Skadi"]No, Gladiia... she's still asleep. You never asked her... whether or not she wants to go.
[name="Skadi"]You want to take her away from here.
[name="Gladiia"]You seem to show a great deal of interest in these new colleagues of yours. Do they not treat you too in kind? It would be but a passing motion for you to pinch their spines to dust, yet how is it you do not instill dread in them?
[name="Skadi"]For these people of dry land to treat us with enmity is normal, but not for the ones aboard this ship. The ones I have met would not.
[name="Gladiia"]I still cannot fathom why you drop your guard.
[name="Skadi"]No... I don't want to get them mixed up in this matter. The problem doesn't lie with me, nor them.
The problem lies in you.
Skadi takes a step toward.

[name="Gladiia"]Hunter Skadi.
[name="Gladiia"]—On dry land, I will not constrain you with my rank of Consul.
[name="Skadi"]Hm...
[name="Gladiia"]Yet neither do I have any obligation to explain myself to you.
[name="Gladiia"]I simply believe that I should have you know. It was I who took her, a member of my own company. This suffices.

[name="Bounty Hunter A"]Still remember the 'Captain,' Skadi? We've got his money, and now we're gonna avenge him with your life!
[Character(name="avg_npc_007", name2="avg_npc_008",focus=2)]
[name="Bounty Hunter B"]You crackbrained idiot... you crackbrained idiot! I said this was a rotten idea!
[name="Bounty Hunter B"]Didn't we say using his money to run some cons would be enough?! Avenge my ass, bounty my ass! What chance in hell?!
[name="Bounty Hunter B"]Remember the rumors! If that's really her, you think there's a single cent in this for us? It'll cost our lives!
[name="Bounty Hunter B"]We'd better scram before it's too late! Grab your dumb scrap and run!
[Character(name="avg_npc_007", name2="avg_npc_008",focus=1)]
[name="Bounty Hunter A"]Pah.
[name="Bounty Hunter A"]You go crawling back to your shitheap bed cuddling burdenbeast piss and yelling mamá. You lose your nerve the moment a single long-haired girl says something to you. You want ME to go home empty-handed? No goddamn way!
[Character(name="avg_npc_008", name2="avg_npc_008",focus=2)]
[name="Bounty Hunter C"]You're right! Even if she really is Skadi, even if, what the hell can she do? She's all alone right now, isn't she?
[name="Bounty Hunter C"]We've got one, two... yeah, a bunch of guys!
[Character(name="avg_npc_008", name2="avg_npc_008",focus=1)]
[name="Bounty Hunter B"]But all those powerhouse bounty hunters are rotting in the ground, aren't they? She was alone then too!
[name="Bounty Hunter B"]And think about it, every time you say you have so many guys, does anything good ever come of it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_007")]
[name="Bounty Hunter A"]And who saw that? If you ask me, those guys? Maybe they just got drunk off their asses one night and all went into the same pretty little Kuranta's room.
[name="Bounty Hunter A"]Then she got her crossbows out her pants, went free-for-all, blew their brains to mush.
[name="Bounty Hunter A"]That's what rumors are! If all those wandering singers or whoever went around singing and playing without puffing their stories up a little, you think they'd make enough money to eat?
[name="Bounty Hunter A"]Splitting fifty mountains with a single sword, yeah, right... and I can punch a hole straight through Londinium with one fist!
[Character(name="avg_npc_007")]
[name="Bounty Hunter A"]Listen to me, brothers! If you wanna eat, come with me!
[name="Bounty Hunter A"]Skadi, Schmadi, we can put her down right here, and nobody can pinch our gold after! Add the bounty the others put on her head, we'll be set for the rest of our lives plus retirement!

[name="Skadi"](Ægirian) It's the rotted seagrass that clings most to one's leg.
[name="Skadi"]I never thought it would be the annoyance of worthless bounty hunters that remained ever unchanging.
