The breeze in the mountains is ever crisp and cool.
And mornings as refreshing as these are always fine for settling muddy, murky matters.
In a mountain-sat village, when kitchen's smoke has just sprung up, the snow still unreceded in spring, one old and one young stand off against each other.
The only sound, the single strike of a faraway gong.

Simply put, the man is adept in walking passes, in climbing mountains. The steps he lifts and places, day after day after day, are truly too many to count.
In one clean noise, clay bricks shatter in the ground. Before him, dust drifts down. By his gaze is a simple, common bamboo-wood carrying pole. His gaze itself, faint rage.
