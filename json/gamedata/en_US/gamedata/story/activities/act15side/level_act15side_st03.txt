[name="Dusk"] Man?

[Character(name="avg_2023_ling_1#9$1",name2="avgnew_2015_dusk_1#5$1",  focus=1)]
[name="Ling"] The Grand Tutor, at that time. Thus he was willingly bound in captivity by Yan, and with every loss, he would stay prisoner sixty years.
[Character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#1$1")]
[name="Nian"] Heh. If Yan always had a genius to beat him, he'd never get a foot out of the capital his whole life, huh?
[Character( name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#1$1",name2="avg_2023_ling_1#7$1", focus=2)]
[name="Ling"] Who can profess to know? He's very poor at the chesses, truth be told.
[name="Ling"] Very slow to learn them, too. Centuries ago, in one cycle of sixty years, he lost hundreds upon thousands of games. The following cycle, he lost some less, and after one more, no more than a hundred games, give or take.
[Character(name="avg_2023_ling_1#6$1")]

[Character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#6$1",name2="avg_2023_ling_1#1$1", focus=1)]

[name="Ling"] Perhaps it was a good, long while since last he lost in one fell swoop.
