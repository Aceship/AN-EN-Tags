[name="Lee"]  No, it's actually because... I have a lot of friends in Lungmen.
[name="Lee"]  And aside from Mr. Liang the shut-in, the only friend I have in Shangshu is you, Master Shen.

[name="Pole-Carrier"]  There are a few spots that fit the description. Very few visitors, but there are some pavilions that have been around for a while. I marked them on the map.
[name="Pole-Carrier"]  As for your wine shops, wherever there's a settlement, it's practically guaranteed that there's one. These places fit the bill.

[name="Lee"]  I remember that time in school, outside the Chamber of Teachers Emeriti, when you said you were going to bless all under heaven. You said the world's a harsh, cold place, so you'd build a fire to warm everyone up, and they would never know darkness again.

[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#2$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  They may take different forms, but all nations approach the same problem in their own way. Everyone faces this issue.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#7$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Though, because of certain... historical reasons, Great Yan's Sui Regulator happens to be at the forefront of 'Feranmutology.' Always has been. Always will be.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Kjerag still worships them as gods and Sami attempts to coexist with them, but the Sui Regulator's research has advanced to unparalleled heights.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#5$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  So, the 'Sui' in Sui Regulator is the same 'Sui' that Nian talked about?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Did Nian tell you about those legends? The old emperor, the wild hunt, and what they uncovered?
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#7$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  (That's the stuff Lava talked about...)
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#2$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  In ancient times, the people thought of certain creatures as 'gods,' and with civilization's advancement, they gradually began to go into hiding.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  The 'Sui' is one such creature.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#2$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]

[name="Zuo Le"]  All you need to know is that when at last they come to bring destruction to the world, Yan has the power to annihilate them. That's all.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  Fair enough...
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  This is not exactly confidential Sui Regulator information, but it's not exactly common knowledge either.

[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Nian, Dusk, and the one who's in hiding somewhere in Shangshu. All of them are under the Sui Regulator's surveillance.
[name="Zuo Le"]  Normally, these things would not happen at such a pace. But then one day, the clouds all dissipated from that mountain. By the time the Sui Regulator Candleholders arrived, Dusk was nowhere to be found.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  That happened just a few days ago.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Rhodes Island is getting itself involved without knowing the whole picture. The ignorant are blameless. On the contrary, it's unimaginable that you would work with those two without knowing anything.
[name="Zuo Le"]  And now, we would like Rhodes Island to follow the Sui Regulator's arrangement and persuade the Lungmenite to surrender the goblet himself.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#7$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  I knew it... Liang Xun was under your thumb the whole time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Correct.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#7$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  You call the magistrate by name, but gave the Lungmenite a courtesy title. That shows you are a good person.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#7$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  Does being a good person mean anything else in Yan?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Please don't get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to beat around the bush. All I'm saying is that you aren't hiding your trust in the Lungmenite anymore. Is it because of his partnership with Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  It's actually more than that... He's a friend too.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  There aren't many people we can truly call friends. It seems Nian and Dusk are your friends too.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#7$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  It sounds like the Sui Regulator has some high standing in Yan. So why the ruse? Who are you trying to fool?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#2$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  I'm afraid that's more than what Rhodes Island needs to know.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  And you straight up admit that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  There's nothing to hide. It's just a more elegant way to go about this to save our mandarins some face.
[name="Zuo Le"]  Now that I've told Rhodes Island so much, can we set aside our differences and negotiate?
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#5$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  You want our help?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  We'd like Mr. Lee's too.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  What do you need help with?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]  The elimination of the Sui.

[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  Your stones are set only in Yan.
[name="Lee?"]  Correct. The board is entirely within Yan's borders.
[name="Lee?"]  Though I am not necessarily playing every round. In that case, the other games must take place elsewhere in the world too.
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  Will those games have aught to do with you?
[name="Lee?"]  Real men remain silent as they spectate and never regret their moves.
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  So all you do is spectate. You watch mankind as they wage wars and battle with each other.
[name="Lee?"]  I'm just learning the art of the game by spectating. Even children start to play by imitating.
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  Hm...
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  But you are not him.
[name="Lee"]  What do you mean?
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  You... Oh, you are one of his pieces.
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  Will you play in his stead, then? Mr. Lee of Lungmen?
[name="Lee"]  What...? I...?
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  Hoh... This is peculiar.
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  Why did he drag an ordinary man like you into this game?
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  No, perhaps he didn't choose you in particular. He simply realized that things would come to this sooner or later, no matter who and no matter what?
[name="Lee"]  What are you talking about?
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  I'm saying you are not the disheartened man, but you are sitting here in his stead, playing a game with me.
[name="Lee"]  Who are you...?
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  Ling.
[name="Lee"]  What is this place?
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  A dream... from a hundred years ago.
[name="Lee"]  Now that's funny. How could I have a dream that takes place a whole century ago...?
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  Indeed...
[name="An Indistinct Dream"]  How could you?
