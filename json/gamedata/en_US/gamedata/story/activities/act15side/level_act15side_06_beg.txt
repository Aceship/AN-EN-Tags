In one or two more branches' time, the color of dusk will paint the sky.
These are the Three Mounts and Seventeen Peaks, though which mount this is, or which peak, is a mystery.
The only thing known is that a pavilion sits atop, Shangshu's scenery both past and present visible from within, beauty unparalleled.
Yet regrettably, this pavilion is currently deserted, and so no one is there to see it.
And on that note, people have come.

[name="Boatman"]  I see.
[name="Boatman"]  The passes around these summits are all hard to traverse. They always said in olden times that Shu's paths tried you. People argue which ones that meant, but it's all of them, in truth.
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Kroos"]  Master Shen, you think there's a reason Mr. Lee told us to find him at Qujiang Peak?
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Boatman"]  When he was looking into the goblet's origins for Mr. Liang, the first place he said he'd head for was Qujiang Peak.
[name="Boatman"]  And he asked for 'Zuanjiang Peak.' Only a few locals know that old name; the authorities changed it however many years ago. I was baffled how he even knew it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#10$1",focus=2)]
[name="Kroos"]  Maybe Mr. Lee found some kind of lead on it...
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Boatman"]  He did have a lead. He said, he dreamt of it.
[name="Boatman"]  I assumed he was hiding something, using that reason to parry me, so I didn't follow up... If he really did see it in his dreams, then that's all more curious.
[name="Boatman"]  Hmm... Qujiang Peak is a high and treacherous one. It gets the least tourists. It's all the more peaceful here, compared to the well-inhabited Nini Peak with its gentle flat paths, or Shuzhou Peak covered with old theater byways.
[name="Boatman"]  You've seen... the few small villages, buildings left, are all left over from long, long ago.
[name="Boatman"]  Though...
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Kroos"]  Is there some other hint?
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Boatman"]  Though... when Qujiang Peak was still called Zuanjiang Peak, atop this region of mountain, there was actually another peak.
[name="Boatman"]  It and Zuanjiang together were called the 'Twin Peaks High as the Sun,' the two most majestic prominences of the Three Mounts and Eighteen Peaks.
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#8$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Boatman"]  And this peak had countless cliffs, the steepest parts almost vertical, like a stone sword against the heavens when you looked from afar. It was a magnificent sight.
[name="Boatman"]  If you watched from any other peak at sunset, it was as if the sun fell straight on it, as if someone ran it through by their blade.
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Boatman"]  Sadly, later there was a massive Catastrophe, like fire and storm linking hands, and the terrain around here was scarred well. Most of that swordlike peak collapsed and crumbled. That was thirty years ago, now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#2$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Boatman"]  You can pull aside any Shangshuite on the street of at least some age, and they could all tell you clear and cleanly of the marvel of those black clouds weighing on the city.
[name="Boatman"]  I regret I wasn't eking my living on this river yet then. I never got to see it with my own eyes.
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#2$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Kroos"]  A Catastrophe... And Shangshuites'd call it a marvel?
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#5$1",focus=1)]
[name="Boatman"]  It's a strange thing. It came without the slightest warning. By the time the Imperial Astronomers got the warning out telling the villages nearby to evacuate, it was already barely manageable. There should've been no escape from it...
[name="Boatman"]  But ultimately, thunder clapped and the storm faded, and apart from a few lightly battered houses, all the residences in the mountains suffered not a single bit of damage, and not one person was afflicted. That was the first wonder.
[name="Boatman"]  Afterwards, the Tumu tianshi came to inspect the altered mountain terrain. Normally, with a wondrous peak collapsing like that, there should be visible traces left.
[name="Boatman"]  But apart from half of the rocky 'hilt' left next to Qujiang Peak, not a single chunk of boulder or sign of the landslide was found. That was the second wonder.
[name="Boatman"]  What caused any of that, nobody knows. There's just some wild rumors, barely worth trusting.
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Kroos"]  Never thought something like that happened in Shangshu before...
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=1)]
[name="Boatman"]  Yan's history and its legends have always blended together.
[name="Boatman"]  Like how some rumors say Shangshu's birth was to do with the lands in ancient people's dreams. The factual matter of things is beyond anyone's research powers, now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Kroos"]  The peak that disappeared—what was its name?

[name="Boatman"]  The sunseeker. Xunri Peak.
[name="Boatman"]  But Yan's development has flown by. I fear to the younger generation, things that happened thirty years ago wouldn't be worth the time, being so far in the past.

[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  (Rim Billitonian) It's... some Originium Arts creation-type.
[Character(name="avg_476_blkngt_1#5$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]  (Rim Billitonian) Originium Arts? Like those stunts the Leithanian lord boys pull? You revvin my cylinder? Had me thinkin' it was some Yan critter I could tame...
[Character(name="avg_476_blkngt_1#8$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]  (Rim Billitonian) Which galah went and made these things up...?! Light! Just let it go, it's as useful as an ashtray on a bike!

[name="Blacknight"]  (Rim Billitonian) I...
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#7$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  (Rim Billitonian) You a Messenger's guard? Bounty hunter?
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#11$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  (Rim Billitonian) No sense in shootin' a hound if it's gone into the neighbors paddock, wanna work together on this?
[Character(name="avg_476_blkngt_1#1$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]  (Rim Billitonian) I don't know you from Bruce, mate, so don't think I'm gonna trust ya
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#11$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  (Rim Billitonian) A Billy, though.
[Character(name="avg_476_blkngt_1#8$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]  (Rim Billitonian) Not every one of them's so nice.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#10$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  (Rim Billitonian) That's a dead shame, then...
[Character(name="avg_476_blkngt_1#1$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]  (Rim Billitonian) But getting to meet a Billitonian out here's still got me gobsmacked
[Character(name="avg_476_blkngt_1#3$1")]
[name="Blacknight"]  (Rim Billitonian) Hooroo. See you round like a boomerang, Cautus.

[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_302_1#1$1")]
[name="Pole-Carrier"]  Is it yours?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]

[name="Pole-Carrier"]  But you're so young... You're one I've never met before.
