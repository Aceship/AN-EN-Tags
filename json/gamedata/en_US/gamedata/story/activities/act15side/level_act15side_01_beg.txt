The inn has over ten branch locations in Shangshu. Yet, they do not take the name Xingyu. Perhaps Xinglu for a journey fortunate, or Xingfu for a journey blessed—but Xingyu, for a journey plentiful, belongs to this inn alone.
And of course, this inn alone provides such an incredible view of the skyscrapers against the twin moons mirrored in the distant lake at night. The innkeeper paid mind only to the scenery when choosing locations. Not to the guests, nor to the rent.
Fine scenery puts guests in a fine mood. Fine scenery puts all in harmony, and the coin will come whether you like it or not.

[name="Boatman"]  I'm only a boatman, what's there to admire? Lately they've been putting engines on the boats. Maybe I'll be out of a job in a few years.
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_294_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Lee"]  They'll still need someone to navigate the route and keep watch on the sky. I figure as long as there are waterways and the years run long, boatmen and Catastrophe Messengers are in the same boat.
