Midday. The skies are clear, as though the heavy rains the night before had been nothing but a lie.
The second tallest of Shangshu's Three Mounts is Mount Juqi. Juqi is home to only two of the Seventeen Peaks, the lesser of which is Nini Peak.
There are twenty two hundred and twenty two steps leading up to Nini Peak. While this may seem like a fascinating coincidence, additional steps were added specifically for the gimmick.
The steps lead heavenward through the clouds. The higher you get, the fewer visitors can be found. A lush, green mountain, rarely ever trodden by footsteps.
A few men can be seen here and there; all of them appear to be pole-carriers on first glance.

[name="Teahouse Stopperby"]  This is no Mount T'ien, but truly, what a fine summit.
[name="Teahouse Stopperby"]  How do you suppose they built a teahouse up here in the mountains, when the roads aren't so much as paved?
[Character(name="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_304_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Teahouse Tourist"]  Hmm. By hand. How else?
[name="Teahouse Tourist"]  On our way up here, we saw a pole-carrier walking down the mountain, didn't we? They do this every day, carrying anything from foodstuffs to bricks up from the base of the mountain.
[name="Teahouse Tourist"]  From what I hear, a single trip takes them a good few hours. It's very toilsome work. Even today, some remote mountains still rely on pole-carriers for their survival...
[Character(name="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_304_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Teahouse Stopperby"]  Can't they build a ropeway for some cable cars or something?
[Character(name="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_304_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Teahouse Tourist"]  First they'd need a plot of land to build it on, wouldn't they?
[Character(name="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_304_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Teahouse Stopperby"]  Right, not that I know the first thing about building ropeways... Those guys really are amazing, though.
[name="Teahouse Stopperby"]  They probably rake in quite a bit dough, don't they?
[Character(name="avg_npc_303_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_304_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Teahouse Tourist"]  Not until recently. I saw on the news not too long ago that the Shangshu magistrate thinks very highly of the coolies. The government's even footing the bill for the teahouses' tea... Uhh?

[name="Teahouse Tourist"]  I-I think so? It hasn't been that long, has it? He's back already?
[name="Teahouse Tourist"]  He and his buddies must have some kind of relay system so he only has to go down halfway. That's the only plausible explanation.

[name="Kroos"]  I talked to Lava, you see. Asked her to contact the Operators near Shangshu and have them come get us as soon as she made it to the office.

[name="Mr. Nothing"]  I see. You'll handle this fairly and impartially, while remaining vigilant and conscientious. You continue to command my utmost respect, benefactor.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#2$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#8$1",focus=2)]
[name="Kroos"]  But Mr. Lee's a smart man... He never bothered requesting Rhodes Island's assistance ever since we ran into him at the inn. Maybe he's been trying to tell us not to get involved.
[name="Kroos"]  If this really does have to do with Nian, though... Not to mention Taihe and Zuo Le...
[name="Kroos"]  Anyway, we'll check out the rendezvous point when the time comes. Nian's probably gonna be a no-show, but Dusk isn't that kind of girl. We might see her there.
