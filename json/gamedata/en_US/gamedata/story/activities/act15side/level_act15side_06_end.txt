[name="Miss Ning"]  Yet for what difference tolls, some matters shall remain constant.
[name="Miss Ning"]  Nowhere in the Three Mounts and Seventeen Peaks may it be found. Will you still search, my Lord?
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  I need to.
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Miss Ning"]  You would balk at nothing, deceive me, deceive us all for this need?
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  I need to find it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#5$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Miss Ning"]  Why?
[name="Miss Ning"]  Surely you are aware that e'en justified thousandfold, to impinge is still to impinge, and to contravene is still to contravene?
[name="Miss Ning"]  Surely you know that should you err once, not only do you forfeit the future, but you bear the brunt of the guilt?
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#5$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Miss Ning"]  Surely you understand... I am willing to hear what you say?
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  I understand that.
[name="Liang Xun"]  It's all the more reason I cannot tell you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#7$1",focus=1)]
[name="Miss Ning"]  Why?
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  Because as I serve as a city magistrate, I account for that single city's safety and life. Be it brick or tile or stove or kitchen, so long as the slightest harm comes to it, it is my failure in duty.
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  As those that tower above me disagree, all I may do... is try my hardest.
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Miss Ning"]  When first we met in Shangshu, in my early years, I saw that past your occasional obstinacy, you were principled and upright, of vitality whole. I have been staunch in my trust, that should we work as one, 'twould be no trouble we could not surmount.
[name="Miss Ning"]  Yet in this moment...
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Miss Ning"]  ...I cannot help but be somewhat disappointed.
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  These words...
[name="Liang Xun"]  Are they words of warning, from my friend, Miss Ning, to me...
[Character(name="avg_npc_298_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_295_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  Or a supervisory pressuring, from the Imperial Envoy of Vice-Second Rank, the Assistant Minister of Rites, Ning Ciqiu, upon me?
