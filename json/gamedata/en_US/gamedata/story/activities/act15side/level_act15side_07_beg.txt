My head, poor head... what makes this clamor now... hm?
Ah... it was a folk song of bamboo, clapping away.
He shelves his game, knows not of ages' change. From dreams I wake, ask only of the years... what years... what years...
Urgh...
Why is my wine gone?

Shang Zhong feels at the herbal plaster on his neck, as is his habit.
His ten years taking up his pole every day, climbing up and down the mountain, was his habit too.
Qujiang Peak is incontestably tall and perilous. So tall it lacks any human habitation, so perilous not a sound can be heard.
He's lost count of how many springtimes he's now passed in Shangshu. He raises his head to look afar, and at the end of a pass with no human's former trace, he sees but one person.
A person who has been waiting for him, for a very long time.

[name="Kroos"] Maybe not much else, for all I know. But at the very least, it's worth me.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#7$1")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"] And me. Dusk tore my confusion with a stroke, and gave me what I'll describe as a blunt awakening... I might like to stand to the side of things, but the occasion's fine, and I know to pay a grace back.

[name="Boatman"] *Sigh*... I'm only a boatman, for all my concern is.
[name="Boatman"] I guarded the north for a few years. I chatted with the other soldiers, talking home and the times and so on, throughout all the cold days with nothing to do.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_294_1#8$1", focus=2)]
[name="Boatman"] We all devoted out hearts to Yan, but a little foolishness here and there hardly needed to get away from us.

[name="Liang Xun"] The land is vast and wide, all things free. Under heaven's infinity, all are ordinary men.

[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#9$1", name2="avg_npc_294_1#5$1", focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"] I hope you'll protect the peace and safety of Shangshu, Master Shen. If any setbacks should happen in the end... I hope you'll leap in to pacify the dispute, before Miss Ning and the other five act.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#9$1", name2="avg_npc_294_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Boatman"] There's the old saying. Ultimately, human affairs all depend on heaven's mandate.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#10$1", name2="avg_npc_294_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"] A shame.
