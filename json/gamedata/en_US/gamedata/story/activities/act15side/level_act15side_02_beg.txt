The cold spell of springtide.
It hearkens me back to many scenes of the past: my academic pursuits, my career in business, my training in the martial arts, and my entrance into politics.
In those bygone times, we were inseparable. Kind friends and mentors were always there for us, each of them hoping to realize their own grand aspirations.
What about now?
The green bricks have yet to be cleaned. Spring has long since begun, yet the snow lingers, white as pearls.
It is impossible to know what the man behind the door thinks when it is shut. All you are certain of is that, when it opens, what you know is merely what he wants you to know.
He lifts his head. The door lets out a creak.

[name="Miss Du"]  If he succeeds, it doesn't matter how big a role I played. He'll make me take full credit for it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_296_1#3$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#9$1", focus=1)]
[name="Miss Du"]  The Escort Association has made itself a lot of enemies, and, for all the weight it has to throw around, it's stuck by the old rules even now that the Messenger industry has taken off. They're always left out for being slower to react than everyone else.
[name="Miss Du"]  That's why my father always told me to keep my mouth shut, to hide my shortcomings.
[name="Miss Du"]  He wants me to act like a frivolous playgirl who pisses away his riches. All so no one will give me a second thought.

[name="Miss Du"]  But I'm not part of the equation.
[name="Miss Du"]  Whether it's the Du Yaoye who will inherit the Association, or the Miss Du who's always throwing money around, both are what others expect me to be.
[Character(name="avg_npc_296_1#6$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", focus=2)]

[name="Miss Du"]  Not quite.
[Character(name="avg_npc_296_1#7$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Miss Du"]  The royal court doesn't often come to the Association with a job. If this deal falls through, there is no way my father is going to hand me the keys to the Association just yet.
[name="Miss Du"]  Most people my age look to me for a way out. I told them that if my father's deal falls through, the Association won't expect anything from us youngsters anymore.
[Character(name="avg_npc_296_1#7$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  But either way you're still waiting for your old man to pass the baton to you. What's the difference?
[Character(name="avg_npc_296_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Miss Du"]  That's nothing more than an arrangement to keep us in line. Once I inherit the Association, I will have to follow the rules.
[Character(name="avg_npc_296_1#6$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Miss Du"]  And the 'rules' go way beyond my father.

[name="Lee"]  That's why you've come to me to... uh, help you put on this play of yours?
[Character(name="avg_npc_296_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1", focus=1)]
[name="Miss Du"]  That it is.

[name="Miss Du"]  There's somebody out there, from the royal court, who wants what you have. But you didn't let them have it. Do you understand what that means?
[Character(name="avg_npc_296_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  My friend never told me to hand it over. Besides, isn't he a member of said court?
[Character(name="avg_npc_296_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Miss Du"]  Mr. Liang had you come all this way. He has something else for you, doesn't he?

[name="Lee"]  Only trivial matters.

[name="Miss Du"]  Whatever. I don't really care. It's just, now that it's come to this you won't be able to pretend you've got nothing to do with it anymore. No matter what you intend.
[name="Miss Du"]  I can help you. At the very least, I can guarantee you'll make it back to Lungmen in one piece.

[name="Miss Du"]  Heh, talking to you is easier than I expected.
[name="Miss Du"]  Relax, I may not want to be the innkeeper, but all my friends my age have more than a few things to say about our elders. And all of them follow my orders.
