[name="Lee"]  And this young man is?
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Kroos"]  Operator Mr. Nothing.
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",name2="avgnew_455_nothing_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  I may not have formally taken the post, but my devoted heart and tireless efforts have long since beaten to Rhodes Island's tune.
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",name2="avgnew_455_nothing_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Lee"]  So you're a new operator friend. Good to meet you.
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",name2="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  Well met, well met. I hear from my benefactor that you're also an ally to Rhodes Island? Ah, as expected of Rhodes Island, friend to all and beloved by the masses, that they'd strike an accord with a fine soul like yourself, er...
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#9$1",name2="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Lee"]  Just call me old Lee.
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#9$1",name2="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  How kind of you, Brother Lee.
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",name2="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Lee"]  Well then, brother. You say you only got out once the innkeeper intervened?
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",name2="avgnew_455_nothing_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  Precisely so. What of it?
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#2$1",name2="avgnew_455_nothing_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Lee"]  Hmm... seems things aren't as simple as I thought.
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#6$1")]
[name="Boatman"]  This isn't the place to stand and chat, too many ears. I'd never forgive myself for another setback.
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_294_1#1$1", focus=1)]
[name="Lee"]  Then we'll head straight for the Liang estate.
[name="Lee"]  As for our friends...
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_294_1#6$1", focus=2)]
[name="Boatman"]  I was only told to meet with you. Bringing any more could be a little...
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_294_1#2$1", focus=2)]
[name="Boatman"]  Ah, never mind.
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1", name2="avg_npc_294_1#5$1", focus=2)]
[name="Boatman"]  I doubt Mr. Liang's so small-minded. And you did both help us out, so we'll go together.
[Character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#10$1")]
[name="Kroos"]  The Liang estate, huh... I'd really rather not bother anyone else...
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#10$1",name2="avg_1021_kroos2_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Lee"]  It's fine, you're with me.
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#10$1",name2="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  Decisive words, Brother Lee.
[Character(name="avg_npc_294_1#1$1")]
[name="Boatman"]  Good... if that's settled, then let's be quick. Come, this way.
