[name="Miss Du"]  Have been since Mr. Liang took up office.
[name="Miss Du"]  The last few Shangshu governors were about construction, civil projects, developing the mountains and forests—not just recovering the city from all its troubles, but breathing even more life into it.
[name="Miss Du"]  Maybe Governor Liang Xun thought the city was renewed enough when he came in, because his agenda was peace and love for the citizens instead... Whatever you think of this, you've seen nothing yet.
