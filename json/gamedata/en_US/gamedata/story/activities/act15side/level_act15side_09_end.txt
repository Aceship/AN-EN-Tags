Ling does not speak. She simply, quietly, sits cross-legged, seated upon an ice-cold boulder.
The wind blows aslant in the twilight, the sun about to set beneath.
This pair of enemies faces each other anew.
A zither's single pluck sounds, as if from the heavens. Even so, the girl is not holding one.
