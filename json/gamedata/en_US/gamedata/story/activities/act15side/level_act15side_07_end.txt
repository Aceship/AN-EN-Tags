[name="Zuo Le"] No. Any time the twelve of you meet, exchange messages or converse is a major strain on the Sui Regulator's nerves. How can you be ignorant of that?
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#8$1")]
[name="Nian"] Oh, that's some mature words for such a young kid...
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#3$1")]
[name="Nian"] Who's the boss of the Sui Regulator now? Anyone I know?
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#7$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] You've been idle for too long. The human realm has gone through changes.
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#2$1")]
[name="Nian"] Dang.
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#9$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] Where's Dusk? And where's Ling?
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#6$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] And what intent do you three have, assembling in Shangshu? And what secrets... does this goblet hide?
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#8$1")]
[name="Nian"] You guys asked someone to get the cup from Lungmen, duh. How's that our fault?
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#6$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] You know the significance of us necessitating it be in the Sui Regulator's hands—
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#1$1")]
[name="Nian"] —Of course. This thing's got a chunk of my good ol' second bro's conscious jailed in it.
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] You're well-aware. Then it's exceedingly hard to consider any of you here unaware or innocent.
[character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1")]
[name="Lee"] I wasn't going to pretend to be unaware... even though Liang Xun really didn't tell me a thing.
[character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#11$1")]
[name="Kroos"] Hahah. Might've been stretching it a little when I kept saying Rhodes Island didn't know anything?
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#1$1")]
[name="Nian"] Yeah, I'd say, seeing how you're a casualty.
[character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1")]
[name="Lee"] Me?
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#7$1")]
[name="Nian"] I only just realized it. And you Sui Regulator guys, c'mon, you spent all these years with nothing to do but think about it and you still couldn't get there?
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#6$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] The Feranmut is not only able to separate parts of itself into proxies with independent personalities, but can store its consciousness within certain mediums in order to roam...
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#9$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] But can your proxies really do the same thing over again? Just as if you were an Ursus matryoshka.
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#6$1")]
[name="Nian"] I don't know if we can or not... Maybe it's a new trick he came up with.
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#2$1")]
[name="Nian"] So he can collect all hundred and eighty-one black stones or something like that.
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#7$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] Wouldn't he go mad?
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#1$1")]
[name="Nian"] I mean, he's already gone mad, though. With him locked up in the capital, it's not like you can't pay him a visit.
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] Meeting with him would be the greatest taboo.
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#8$1")]
[name="Nian"] You Sui Regulator people have done so much, and you still care?
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#6$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] What about Dusk? What did you seek Dusk for? And why did you come here after doing so?
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#7$1")]
[name="Nian"] ...I have an idea.
[character(name="avg_npc_297_1#6$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"] According to the records, you're always full of ideas.
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#1$1")]
[name="Nian"] Hm... I guess you actually know a little about me, huh?
[character(name="avg_1021_kroos2_1#10$1")]
[name="Kroos"] (She's looking this way...)
[character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#2$1")]
[name="Lee"] ......
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#8$1")]
[name="Nian"] I want...
[character(name="avgnew_2014_nian_1#4$1")]
[name="Nian"] ...to come up with a way to wipe out that giant thing.
