'The Shangshu Mountains are full of walkways, winding through its steep peaks among the clouds.'
A conspicuous sign stands here. The sign itself is new, and so are the letters written upon it. The words, however, are old.
The mountain is old, and so are the stone steps. The cable cars and the people, however, are all new.

I scratch my head and am surprised to find my hair less of a damp mess than expected. It is as though some indescribable sensation is enlightening my entire body and soul.
All one's vivid daytime memories quickly fade away. Yet, they thoughtfully drift back when needed.

I decide to make my way up.
I am not sure why I do so, but even if these steps took me immediately heavenward, I would still ascend.
As if in response to my sincerity, I find yet another sign around the corner.
A new sign, this time accompanied by new words. It resembles one that advertises scenic spots for tourists.

[name="Mr. Nothing"]  Sir, someone just spotted a thief making off with a case that looked just like yours!
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1")]
[name="Liang Xun"]  Is the case gone?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  You mean the wine cup...? Don't worry. It's right here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  How did you...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  The box only contains an ordinary teapot I took from the cupboard, painted black with ink.
[name="Lee"]  I'm not stupid enough to leave it out in the open, knowing someone is after it.
[Character(name="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  My good man, you are every bit the cunning genius that Kroos described.

[name="Lee"]  Mr. Liang.
[name="Lee"]  Someone out there is bold enough to provoke the magistrate for an old antique. If every thief were this brazen, the L.G.D. would only need to guard street food stands.
[name="Lee"]  So isn't it time you told me what this is about?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  I will tell you everything you need to know.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  Which also coincides with the other matter I need your help with.
[name="Liang Xun"]  Find its owner.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  I see... Some actual detective work this time.
[Character(name="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",name2="avgnew_455_nothing_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Lee"]  Before that though... Mr. Nothing, where's that benefactor of yours, Kroos?
