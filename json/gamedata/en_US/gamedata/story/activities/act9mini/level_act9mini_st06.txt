[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  I knew you right away, actually... but, like you said, it was a long time ago. I wasn't sure if it was something I should bring up.
[name="Malkiewicz"]  If I remember correctly, we were reaching out to newcomers for the knightclubs... and we were assigned to the same list of names.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  Yes, that's correct.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  Do you remember the knights we were assigned to contact?
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  I... I'm sorry, but I don't remember.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  It was a few infected knights...
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  Right, right. Yes, the Infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  Please... don't call them that...
[name="Malkiewicz"]  They were just knights, unfortunate enough to get infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  Yes... Truly unfortunate...
[name="Staff Worker"]  However, they were fortunate enough to have met you. Thanks to you, they were able to join a proper knightclub. I am sure that was more than those Infected... I mean, the knights could ask for.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  About that...
[name="Malkiewicz"]  I think you might be mistaken. We didn't actually finish that job.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  What...? Hold on, if I recall correctly...
[name="Staff Worker"]  Was it... the time we tried to recruit the Flametail Knight, the Fartooth Knight, those ones?
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  Do you remember now? That's right. They had just won a few matches... You reminded them to review the contract the knightclub provided them.
[name="Malkiewicz"]  The knights were still young. We couldn't bring ourselves to lie to them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  ......
[name="Staff Worker"]  It's true that the knightclub's terms for the infected knights weren't very reasonable. I mean, they may seem fair at first glance.
[name="Staff Worker"]  However, we normally wouldn't go into the fine print for the infected knights.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  Right... normally, we wouldn't have done that.
[name="Malkiewicz"]  Though this did have to do with the knights' future...
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  No one can predict the future.
[name="Staff Worker"]  Just like... Just like you.
[name="Staff Worker"]  If I hadn't taken a look at your file beforehand, I wouldn't have recognized you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  I looked in the mirror before I left home this morning. If the person in the mirror hadn't waved with me, I would not have recognized myself.
[name="Malkiewicz"]  ...In any case. Thank you for remembering who I am.

[name="Malkiewicz"]  Well... I don't think it's necessarily one...
[name="Malkiewicz"]  To tell the truth, I think I might feel more terrified than anything else.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  Terrified?
[name="Staff Worker"]  What are you terrified of?
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  Many, many things. I hardly get any sleep, and regardless of whether all this is real or fake, nothing good will come of it... The only difference it makes is that things are bad in entirely different ways.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  The way you think is... peculiar.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  R-Really...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  Yes. After all, you are experiencing quite the rags to riches story.
[name="Staff Worker"]  From a lowly office worker, you rose to the top and joined the big leagues... I think most of us have dreamt of something similar.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  It's something that everyone has fantasized... Indeed...
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  What's so bad about it? It's not often that dreams actually come true.
[name="Staff Worker"]  Luck was on your side, Mr. Malkiewicz.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  But I didn't really... I...
[name="Malkiewicz"]  ......
[name="Malkiewicz"]  I understand.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  Do you really understand? There are many who envy you for what you have gone through.

[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#6",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  Uhh, I mean, perhaps this is what's most terrifying.
[name="Malkiewicz"]  It's all going too well, too natural, and it's all too structured... It all happened way too quickly.

[name="Malkiewicz"]  There was no way I could possibly understand...
[name="Malkiewicz"]  Even though, from head to heels, this getup is specially tailored to make me a big deal, that doesn't mean I've really become one...
[name="Malkiewicz"]  Actually, I don't think this outfit suits me at all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  Nonsense... It looks great on you.
[name="Staff Worker"]  ......
[name="Staff Worker"]  This may come off as rude... but I ask you to forgive me in light of us having worked together in the past.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  What is it? Please...
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  A bit of advice, Mr. Malkiewicz.
[name="Staff Worker"]  As someone whom fortune has smiled upon, you should try to refrain from sharing your feelings to those who, like me, are less fortunate.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  ......

[name="Staff Worker"]  I really wish to empathize with the way you feel, but alas...
[name="Staff Worker"]  I can't.
[name="Staff Worker"]  There are many who wish to be in your position, myself included, but we aren't so fortunate.
[name="Staff Worker"]  Do you understand?
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  I...
[name="Malkiewicz"]  I do... but still...
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  Perhaps you do have your worries. You feel fear, anxiety, and hesitation... but no matter what you are feeling...
[name="Staff Worker"]  You are well groomed and dressed to kill, you have the invitation in your hand, and you are walking inside this building as the spokesman for the General Chamber of Commerce.
[name="Staff Worker"]  Regardless of what you think yourself, in the eyes of everyone else, you are very much a big deal.
[name="Staff Worker"]  The venue is straight ahead, Mr. Malkiewicz. Please excuse me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Malkiewicz"]  Wait...!
[Character(name="avg_npc_223", name2="avg_npc_211_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Staff Worker"]  I wish you a pleasant day.
