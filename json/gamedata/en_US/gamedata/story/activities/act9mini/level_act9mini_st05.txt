[name="Zofia"]  But I'm sure this 'normal' feels enough like a punishment for him.

[name="Zofia"]  Maria has a point, Margaret.
[name="Zofia"]  It doesn't matter how the Knights Association deals with this, or what the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi's decision is. To the masses and the knights, you are still the Radiant Knight.
[name="Zofia"]  I have to admit... I don't get it either. I don't understand why you insist on competing again... I don't understand what you're thinking.
[name="Zofia"]  But I'm sure you have it figured out. Stubbornness may run in the family, but that's not the same thing as recklessness.
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_ns_1#3")]
[name="Margaret"]  This is just the beginning...
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_ns_1#7")]
[name="Margaret"]  Whether I take the crown or not... it's just a beginning.
[name="Margaret"]  Maria, Auntie Zofia. If all we do is cower on the sidelines and look on at society with indifference, if we only comfort ourselves, insisting that nothing can be done—
[name="Margaret"]  —then when will we truly regain our glory?
[name="Margaret"]  Are the knights of Kazimierz destined to wallow forever in times long past?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6")]
[name="Zofia"]  So you want to...
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_ns_1#6")]
[name="Margaret"]  Shining light on the tragedies of the world is not a permanent commitment to dispelling the darkness.
[name="Margaret"]  Sometimes... Sometimes, it's just to illuminate the path forward, to help those who are lost see things from a new perspective.
[name="Margaret"]  Even in today's Kazimierz, there is still meaning to keeping our faith.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#7")]
[name="Maria"]  Margaret...
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6")]
[name="Zofia"]  Alright... Sounds like you've made up your mind.
[name="Zofia"]  But you put on such a show as soon as you got back to Kazimierz. If there's a chance... Margaret.

[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#4")]

[name="Margaret"]  Maria Nearl, you will be an excellent knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#4", name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Maria"]  Oh... right.
[name="Maria"]  About that... Margaret. If you're thinking of joining the Major, you probably won't have time to rack up the points you need, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#4", name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Margaret"]  It will be difficult, but not impossible.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5")]
[name="Zofia"]  Right... Just like the Candle Knight who's been popular the past few years. I understand it didn't even take her a month to earn enough points.
[name="Zofia"]  That may be the case, but the Candle Knight racked up her points early in the preliminaries. Even if Margaret gains the Knights Association's approval right away, we'd still be cutting it close.
[name="Zofia"]  What's your plan?
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_ns_1#6")]
[name="Margaret"]  The competition's rules have changed, but the basics are still the same. So long as I scrape together a win in the melees, I should still stand a chance.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#5", name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1",focus=1)]
[name="Maria"]  But... that's too risky! I drew a lot of attention when I stepped into the ring. If you take to the arena yourself, you're bound to attract even greater opponents...!
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5")]
[name="Zofia"]  Right, and we can't say for sure that the corporations won't pull their dirty tricks on you.
[name="Zofia"]  Anyway, we need to come up with a plan as soon...
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_npc_061#5",focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  I... I have an idea.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_npc_061#5",focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  Maria?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_npc_061#5",focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  Independent knights... like me and Margaret... aren't part of a knightclub, so we compete as part of a 'knight family,' right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_npc_061#5",focus=1)]
[name="Zofia"]  That's true... You used the Nearl family coat of arms during your matches.
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", name2="avg_npc_061#5",focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  And, if I remember correctly, it's not just knights of the same knightclub who are allowed to transfer their points, right? Those from the same knight family are allowed to do the same?
[Character(name="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#2", name2="avg_npc_061#5",focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_061#5", name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#6",focus=2)]

[name="Maria"]  —I don't care!
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#7", name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Maria"]  I... I chose to become a knight because I wanted our home to be ours.
[name="Maria"]  The Nearl family's ancestors... Grandfather... Father... and you. I didn't want to lose all that. I wanted to protect the Nearls' glory.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#5", name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#3",focus=2)]
