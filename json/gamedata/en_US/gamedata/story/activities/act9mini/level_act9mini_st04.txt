[name="Plastic Knight"]  ......
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Heh... Sure, you're right about that.
[name="Plastic Knight"]  It's funny, Kazimierz as it is today. An Infected can be a knight, and a gang of thugs like the Armorless can roam about freely.
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Funny...
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#2", focus=2)]

[name="Flametail Knight"]  Huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#6", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  On my way to the Grand Knight Territory, I got infected.
[name="Justyna"]  And since I was Infected, they wouldn't let me register as a knight. So I wandered around for three weeks with nowhere to stay.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#7", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Hmm...
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  It was during the third week that the Blood Knight won the Major.
[name="Justyna"]  Then, three weeks later, they opened the registration window for Infected knights.
[name="Justyna"]  I didn't have any money left on me, so I went to the black market ring, working up enough money to pay the registration fees.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#7", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  That... couldn't have been easy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  Underground knight sports for infected knights is pretty much the same as the black market.
[name="Justyna"]  From the underground competitions to the Major, I've seen too many ridiculous things to be surprised anymore.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#7", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Haha! Fair enough. There's definitely stuff going on in the underground fights that tops whatever the Armorless Union can come up with.
[name="Flametail Knight"]  We've all been through stuff like that, more or less, and that's how we end up here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  There sure are a lot of Infected here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Right... how can I put it? You can make a lot in the knight competitions, at least enough to buy a place for these people who have nowhere else to go.
[name="Flametail Knight"]  So that means the money's still worth something, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#7", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  Right.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Heh. Nice.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  ?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  You're easier to get along with than we might've thought. When I first bumped into you, I was worried you were all icy cold.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#6", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Oh? You got all quiet?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#6", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  I don't know...
[name="Justyna"]  I just... I just don't know... I guess I don't know what to say at times like this.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#3", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Ugh.
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Alright... I think I get it now. You and Ashley are both shy with strangers.
[name="Flametail Knight"]  And this habit of yours where you say half a thing up front, I think I'm getting used to it. Not that there's anything wrong with it, it's just tricky to follow sometimes.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#3", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#8", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  Either way, thanks for helping me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#8", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Ah, it was nothing. Don't sweat it.
[name="Flametail Knight"]  So anyway, where are you gonna go? If you pop right back out, they're gonna go after you again.
[name="Flametail Knight"]  That scuffle back there is gonna get reported soon. What do you think we'll see on the news?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  No idea. Whatever they want.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  Honestly... I don't know where I'd go. I haven't had anywhere to go for a long time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Hmm...
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Well, you may think I'm just throwing it out there to hold it over you, but this is an honest offer, out of the kindness of my heart.
[name="Flametail Knight"]  There's me, and Ashley, and Iwona, you've seen her, with the big loud mouth?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  Yes, I know her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  The truth is... we had the same idea as you, in your little statement about setting up an independent knightclub.
[name="Flametail Knight"]  I came up with the name already. Pinus Sylvestris. The Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, a club of our very own.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  —!
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  And since you've got nowhere to go, Justyna, wouldn't you consider maybe joining us?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  You're... inviting me?
[name="Justyna"]  Are you sure?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122#5", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Flametail Knight"]  Sure as sure can be. Can I spell it out any clearer for you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#8", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  ......
[name="Justyna"]  Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub...
[name="Justyna"]  Alright. I'm in.
[name="Justyna"]  —Us... together.

[name="Justyna"]  How are your wounds?
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Fine. Just a scratch, barely worth mentioning. But you Infected knights, you base yourselves here in the city? Not out in a village somewhere?
[name="Plastic Knight"]  No one would allow the Infected to live within the city limits. Just what are you up to?
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  Nothing.
[name="Justyna"]  When you've got money, you can do anything.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Hah... money. True enough. So long as you have money, you can do anything here.
[name="Plastic Knight"]  But if word gets out, you'll be arrested.

[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#7", focus=1)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Then lead the way. I can't stand the thought of the Armorless Union scum on the loose out there. I'm working against the General Chamber of Commerce now, so I need to move fast.
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Show me to your Infected knight leader, who forced one of your strength to drag me out of the hospital against your will.

[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  It wasn't Sona who sent me to rescue you. It was my own choice. Not at all against my will.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  But how? I understand we have a mutual distaste for one another.
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Or is this some kind of big picture play?
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  No.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  It's just... you have a family.

[name="Plastic Knight"]  Those insects! They dare move against my boy?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  Don't worry, Sona has eyes on him. The Armorless backed off. They didn't touch your son.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=1)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  ......
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Then I must offer my thanks.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  You owe them to Sona. It was all her idea.
[name="Justyna"]  As for me, my personal feelings towards you have nothing to do with whether or not I'll let you get hurt.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103", name2="avg_430_fartth_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Justyna"]  I just... your son...
