[name="Voice on the Television"]  A breakout from the underground arena, two stages advanced in the preliminaries... a challenger with outstanding skill, Infected knight, 'Wild Mane' Iwona Krukowska...

[name="Sona"]  'Wild Mane?'
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_122#7", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  What is it, Sona?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_122#7", focus=-1)]
[name="Voice on the Television"]  ...however, caused an improper altercation with other knights in the rest quarters, and was violent in the confrontation...
[name="Voice on the Television"]  ...may face a 'suspension'...
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_122#7", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  Here it goes again. Another report on the dark side of Infected knights.
[name="Greynuty"]  'Improper altercation.' Hah, do you have to imagine? It can't have been anything but losers hooting at the winner.
[name="Greynuty"]  When it's Infected knights competing, they'll say shit as bad they want to say.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_122#6", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  You saw that clip of the match just now, Ashley. This Kuranta's... got some skills.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2", name2="avg_npc_122#6", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  Her style's pretty distinct from those flower-show nobles, yeah, but she's still a ways off from the top tiers.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2", name2="avg_npc_122#7", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  Mmm...
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#5", name2="avg_npc_122#7", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  You wanna recruit her?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#5", name2="avg_npc_122#5", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  I've heard about her before... some of the knightclub knows her.
[name="Sona"]  What are we still looking for? 'The team leader needs real skill and overpowering force.' Your words, Ashley.
[name="Sona"]  I wanna test our luck. Every independent knight is getting scouted by knightclub agents. If we invite her as an Infected knightclub, that oughta catch her interest.
[name="Sona"]  I've got a feeling she's the one we're looking for.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2", name2="avg_npc_122#5", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  Are you interested in her skill, or do you think she shares our agenda?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  That's what'cha find out in your a little chat.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  Firstly, you need a chance to meet and talk at all. You heard it on the news. The K.G.C.C. is considering handing her a 'suspension'. That's not something you settle with a flick of the wrist.
[name="Greynuty"]  The prelims just started, she's an Infected, and she's green for an independent knight. No one's going to be able to help her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2", name2="avg_npc_122#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  And what if we actually could, this time?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2", name2="avg_npc_122#2", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  You need to think this through properly, Sona. It's a risky gamble. If she's already firm on riding this down to the end, we're going to be rivals.
[name="Greynuty"]  But... if you need to talk to her, it's going to be worth all our strength trying. Where Pinus Sylvestris is right now, every new ally is crucial.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  We oughta try and see. If we can get our point across... then things being what they are, I'm pretty sure she'll want to do a little something for the Infected.

[name="Greynuty"]  I saw that scene at the entrance coming a mile away. You only had a few choices, and one of them was here. Unless... you wanted to bust your way out.
[name="Greynuty"]  Looks like you've got it now though. The further you are from the camera, the better. Let me introduce myself...
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=2)]
[name="Iwona"]  No need, I know you. Big cannon-toter, and there's the other one with the sword. You two Zalaks are partners, and you're good enough in a fight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#4", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=1)]

[name="Sona"]  I'll take that one.
[name="Sona"]  If you already know us and what we do, then this'll go a lot easier.
[name="Sona"]  We keep a keen eye on the Infected knights. So when we saw on TV the kind of trouble you were getting into, we came up with a little plan...
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#7")]
[name="Iwona"]  Could you just come out and say it already? Complicated talk is just gonna hurt my head. What do you want out of me?
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  To put it straight, we're in charge of the Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub. If you believe in the same things we do, then I want you to join us.
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#7")]
[name="Iwona"]  Pinus Sylvestris? Never heard of it.
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  We're a new knightclub, mostly Infected knights...
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#7")]
[name="Iwona"]  ...Infected?
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  Yep.
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#8")]
[name="Iwona"]  You think you'll make more money with a club full of Infected knights barely clinging to life? Ha, must be paradise and a half in your head.
[character(name="avg_npc_122#8")]
[name="Sona"]  No! We're not like the clubs who use Infected as a moneymaking sideshow. We're all about mutual aid between Infected.
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#8")]
[name="Iwona"]  And how's that gonna work?
[character(name="avg_npc_122#4")]
[name="Sona"]  The first part... we'll improve the treatment of Infected knights in the Major. That's the idea.
[name="Sona"]  We all know how the Infected in the other clubs end up. All the money they promise is a scam, and their minimum bet is your life.
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#8")]
[name="Iwona"]  Ha. I bet all the Infected who fought their way through the arena want to ask: when's a single day go by without betting your life?
[name="Iwona"]  When those noble knight families lose, at least they've still got a home to trot back to with their tails between their legs...
[name="Iwona"]  Infected? If you want status, you head into that nightmare of an underground arena with everyone else and lose your mind scrambling for a knight title.
[name="Iwona"]  And just suppose you live through it. How long's your career, how far do you go? That's all for the moneybags to decide. They just wanna see you bleed.
[name="Iwona"]  Beat you half to death? Not enough for 'em. What those lunatic scumbags want to see in their heart of hearts is—
[Character(name="avg_npc_123")]
[name="Greynuty"]  Wild Mane, let's not.
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#9")]
[name="Iwona"]  Ugh. I know. Just venting.
[name="Iwona"]  No point talking about all this, anyway. What I need is someplace I can fix my weapon. I can do better than this beat-up hunk of junk shelled lance.
[character(name="avg_npc_122#3")]
[name="Sona"]  Uh, we may not have a real certified weapon specialist yet, but we could always hire a professional...
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#9")]
[name="Iwona"]  In other words, if I join, I get some basic benefits?
[character(name="avg_npc_122#3")]
[name="Sona"]  Right, salary... we can just about pay you like another knightclub. But, you know, our aim's always been...
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1")]
[name="Iwona"]  Then I'm joining.
[character(name="avg_npc_122#6")]
[name="Sona"]  Oh?
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1")]
[name="Iwona"]  I said, I'm joining. I don't know what your Infected knightclub's gonna be like, but it's gotta beat any other choice.
[name="Iwona"]  I've seen the eyes of the uninfected knights staring at us and I'm through with it. I'm not associating with any of those chuckleheads.
[name="Iwona"]  Before I became a knight, survival was top priority, and everything was for getting fed. Ever since becoming a knight... that hasn't changed much.
[name="Iwona"]  I don't wanna put up with all that just to eat. If your thing can keep my stomach from running empty, and there's no old noble knightheads to make me throw up, then I'm with you for now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#5")]
[name="Greynuty"]  In that case, you want to get paid how much...?
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#2")]
[name="Iwona"]  Uhh...
[name="Iwona"]  (Holds out three fingers)
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#5")]
[name="Greynuty"]  Three?
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#4")]
[name="Iwona"]  Money for three days' food, and the funds to fix my weapon. I'm taking that match the day after tomorrow, and when I get that prize money, I'll pay you back, and then I'm officially splitting the rest with you.
[name="Iwona"]  The K.G.C.C. wanted bail before they'd let me out. Their stupid fine was so precise, it was my bank balance straight up—
[character(name="avg_npc_122#5")]
[name="Sona"]  If anyone could get the number, it'd be them.
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#4")]
[name="Iwona"]  So, right now, I'm penniless, and I'm starving. No objections there?
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  None at all. I can give you an advance here, and when you're done with that pressing stuff, come see us at the knightclub.
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1")]
[name="Iwona"]  Now we're talking. Tell me the address. I'm gonna need your base tomorrow so I can practice how I'm gonna bust clean through the armor of that jackass who had words for me—
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  Alright, I'll spar with you.
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1")]
[name="Iwona"]  Deal, see you there. If you renege on me, I'm coming to find you and you'd better believe I'll settle the score!

[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  I know. That's exactly why this is something we have to do right now. I'll sort out the stuff with Wild Mane later, trust me.

[name="Sona"]  Pffhaha. That's just what I need, you two finding common ground.

[name="Iwona"]  Fess up. Where'd they go?
[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=1)]
[name="Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub Member"]  They went to a neighborhood with an Infected settlement, to scatter them before they're taken away.
[name="Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub Member"]  Wait, Wild Mane!
[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=1)]
[name="Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub Member"]  Flametail and Ashlock, they're both exceptionally kind, honest knights. I'm certain they want to recruit you because they know you're like us...
[name="Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub Member"]  They're not just Infected knights, they're people who want to change the lot of the Infected in Kazimierz.
[Character(name="avg_npc_220", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1#7", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_221", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=2)]
[name="Iwona"]  Ha. Where should I start, then—
[name="Iwona"]  Back when I was still readying to be a campaign knight, this lance was drawn up for the real battlefield, designed to open the way for the forces behind.
[name="Iwona"]  My major lance takes a tremendous amount of force and impact, multiple times over.
[name="Iwona"]  After the way's opened up, I'd switch over to a minor lance.
[name="Iwona"]  But, ever since I started in the arena, I've never let this big thing break.
[Character(name="avg_npc_221", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1", focus=1)]
[name="Infected Knight-Engineer"]  In other words... you haven't used your full strength, because you don't actually want to take anyone's life?

[name="Iwona"]  In those grimy underground arenas...
[name="Iwona"]  Whether it's orders blaring at top volume or captions on the screen, it's all pushing me to do vicious work on someone, and they don't call it a win until they see every other Infected on the ground...
[name="Iwona"]  I never once seriously injured 'em before.
[name="Iwona"]  But when I finally clawed my way to being a competition knight, I heard what those old nobleheads were saying about me in the lounge...
[name="Iwona"]  Well, I hadn't treaded the ground in a long, long time. Took out my minor lance, aimed it right at the armor over those acid-spitters' hearts—
[name="Iwona"]  You understand? I was really, actually hoping to run them straight through.
[Character(name="avg_npc_221", name2="avg_496_wdmane_1#10", focus=1)]
