[name="Sona"]  Mmm? Trying to cozy up to me?
[character(name="avg_npc_123#4")]
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  No. Maybe you're right about Zalak knights... being pretty uncommon.
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  Well, since life's bundled us together, how about we team up?
[character(name="avg_npc_123#5")]
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  Huh?
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  Quit playing around. I'm in this to—
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  To give the knight nobility a little hands-on knock-knock?
[character(name="avg_npc_123#4")]
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  ...How do you...
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  Got it in your eyes.
[name="Sona"]  It's too obvious. There's disdain, there's anger, and they've been your bywords for a little too long—those couple of bigshot knights up in the stands, they're beginning to notice you, y'know?
[character(name="avg_npc_123")]
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  This place isn't worth that.
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  Don't jump to conclusions, okay... take a look around. What are the different kinds of Infected knights around here?
[name="Sona"]  Some bought up by the big shots as a little gambling pastime. There's a share in it for them if they make it, and if they lose, hoo boy, let's not get into that.
[name="Sona"]  Of course, you've got some anonymous nobodies, thirsty for a real-ass high-riding knight or some merchant to pick them out. Thirsty to become... a tool.
[name="Sona"]  They've got no other way. Infected never get any other way.
[character(name="avg_npc_123")]
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  What are you getting at?
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  C'mon. Let's team up, okay?
[name="Sona"]  Your chances in a melee, see, they're always better with a little personal alliancing, y'know?
[character(name="avg_npc_123")]
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  So why do you want to win, then? For the prize money?
[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  No. Because I can't let anyone else win.
[character(name="avg_npc_123#5")]
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  —The hell.
[character(name="avg_npc_122#2")]
[name="Sona"]  There's something going on behind this match. A couple Infected... I'm not too sure yet, but my worry's they've 'settled on it,' so to speak.
[name="Sona"]  They've decided to trample the others, haul themselves on up, for better odds of survival.
[character(name="avg_npc_122#5")]
[name="Sona"]  The only real choice, right? Too real for plenty here to not be thinking it.
[name="Sona"]  —That's why I can't let them win. If someone wins, someone loses. Big whoop. But if someone's living, then... someone's dying.
[character(name="avg_npc_123")]
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  A vague sense of justice isn't gonna win you much trust.
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  But—sure. Right now is make-or-break for Knights Association approval...
[name="An Indifferent Knight"]  I'm in. Zalak and Zalak. Beats teaming with some rando any day.
[character(name="avg_npc_122#5")]
[name="Sona"]  Eh? For real?

[name="Sona"]  Pinus Sylvestris.
[name="Sona"]  I came from around Victoria, if you're curious. Plenty of that sort of pine tree around, back when I was young. These days they're long gone, though.

[character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1#9")]
[name="Iwona"]  Ten years after the Tenth Kazimierz-Ursus War, the Emperor of Ursus got seriously sick, and everything annexed from Kazimierz fell into the nobles' hands.
[name="Iwona"]  The crown prince picked up on the corruption inside the military even before succession, goading two Armies to rise up, as a distraction.
[name="Iwona"]  No way the Ursus nobles could ever agree on one plan, but they were all born and raised in this nation of chaos. They sent their own forces out against Higashi without any argument, so they could cover up their own crimes...
[name="Iwona"]  Which led to Higashi launching an attack of their own on Ursus far beyond what anyone expected, and in the end, the decisive battle took place inside Ursus territory.
[character(name="avg_npc_122#5")]

[name="Sona"]  This morning, Jamie got three, maybe four new Infected in on his end.
[name="Sona"]  Miners, infected in a small industrial accident, but the contractor declined to reimburse their medical fees, so with nowhere to go, they ended up with the police out for them.
[name="Sona"]  And that's not the end... we've had over ten normal Infected join us this month already, right?
[name="Sona"]  They live in the darkest, dankest corners of the Grand Knight Territory... we've got no way to settle them.
[character(name="avg_npc_123#7")]

[character(name="avg_npc_122")]
[name="Sona"]  We've still got time. We've got power. We'll find a way.
[name="Sona"]  But... I won't... let any innocent Infected end up risking themselves with us.
[name="Sona"]  If the Adeptus really will let us all have legal identities again, live on in Kazimierz, then—
