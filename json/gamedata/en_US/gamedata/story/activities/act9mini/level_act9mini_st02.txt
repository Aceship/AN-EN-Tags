[name="Sona"]  It worked out. I was thirsty, I couldn't be bothered to go out to buy water.
[Character(name="avg_496_wdmane_1")]
[name="Iwona"]  Yoo. Our knight returns triumphant.
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1#2", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=1)]
[name="Justyna"]  I'll have to learn from you too, Ashlock, and become stronger.
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1#2", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  Justyna, how'd 'that' go?
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=1)]
[name="Justyna"]  It's done.
[Character(name="avg_430_fartth_1", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  Alrighty. Good work, nice.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  Once the reward hits, I'll wire it over to 'that account.' Word is the bank there's already watching frequent transfers.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_122#7", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  Can we still use personal expenses for the ruse?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_122#7", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  What do you think?
[Character(name="avg_npc_123", name2="avg_npc_122#7", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  Yeah, fair...
[name="Sona"]  We don't have much time left.
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2", name2="avg_npc_122#7", focus=1)]
[name="Greynuty"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_123#2", name2="avg_npc_122", focus=2)]
[name="Sona"]  But we don't need to think about it just yet.
[name="Sona"]  First, let's go celebrate!
