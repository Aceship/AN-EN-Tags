A great, gaping cavern, with bioluminescent organisms emitting light as dim as an old miner's helmet.
Myriad creatures rustle about in the shadows behind Ray, making her reflexively raise her crossbow.
Several small mounds on the ground scatter and bump into each other, revealing themselves to be sandbeasts.

Groups of sandbeasts on the ground and atop the walls jump about, guiding her towards a path that leads deeper into the cavern.
The stone pillars of the cave slant and cross over each other, protecting the glowing area in the center, like a stone nest built by a giant fowlbeast.
The ground itself is folded and creased, the vestiges of the passing of some unknown creature, cutting off at the entrance of a route leading even further down.
The stone beams strewn about are its shed scales. Those great piles of soil its rotting dander.
The sound of the howling gales outside is already cut off, leaving only a drawn-out whistling to echo throughout this natural sanctuary, establishing an order for the creatures who live in the dark.

Ray presses down hard upon her ears, but the echoes still reverberate within her mind.

[name="'Feranmut'"]Ah, forget it, sleep's more important, got to hurry... Say, little one.
[name="'Feranmut'"]Why did you come looking for me?
[name="Ray"]You... saved me.
[name="'Feranmut'"]Did I?
[name="Ray"]A sound that's been echoing from deep in my mind, an immense shadow, a light.
[name="Ray"]It was a miracle. You saved my life, along with many others.
[name="'Feranmut'"]......
[name="Ray"]I remember your light.
[name="Ray"]I've always thought it was something right out of a legend, that the thing that saved us was some giant, friendly beast who lived out in the wilderness.
[name="Ray"]But I checked so many animal almanacs, and none of them ever mentioned a creature large enough to cast the shadow in my memory, or one that could talk to people.
[name="Ray"]All I know is, you are definitely not a hallucination.
[name="Ray"]I just felt that I had to come and find you.
[name="'Feranmut'"]I'm sorry, little one, but I'll have to stop you there.
[name="'Feranmut'"]As you can see, I have no way of moving my body. Even when those little sandbeasts were jumping about in my nostrils, with their horrendously noxious stench, I had no means of removing them.
[name="'Feranmut'"]I am trapped in darkness, bound for decades, perhaps centuries...
[name="'Feranmut'"]So how, I ask, could I have saved you and the other little ones, as according to you?
[name="Ray"]......
[name="Ray"]But, if not you, then who?
[name="Ray"]Maybe there's another Feranmut out here in the wilderness?
[name="'Feranmut'"]I regret to tell you, little one, that there are no more of my kin about here. What little I know of these wildlands, that much I am sure of.
[name="Ray"]......
[name="'Feranmut'"]Take heart, little one. Do not be so down. If it truly vexes you, perhaps you will feel better if you closed your eyes and took a little nap?
[name="'Feranmut'"]Ah, perhaps not, for closing your eyes means being in the dark, and you have a look about you that says that you fear it... Alright, I admit I'm not used to consoling people.
[name="'Feranmut'"]Well, that's enough out of you, I'm feeling sleepy again! You'd best be on your way now, and make sure to take those smelly little things with you!
