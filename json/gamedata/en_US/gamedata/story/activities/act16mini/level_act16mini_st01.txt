[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#12$1", focus="r")]
[name="Potlid"]Yep, I really can't tell at all...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#8$1", focus="r")]
[name="Potlid"]But Lanns... You didn't tell me you were taking it apart...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Potlid"]...Even so, it's amazing!
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#10$1", focus="r")]
[name="Potlid"]You told me the work we had left was a huge pain, and you might not finish if you had to do it all alone. Isn't that why you asked me to buy all those things?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#4$1", focus="r")]
[name="Potlid"]But not only are you all done, you're bowling with the men here. You're even having a lolly water and reading magazines!
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#8$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]Uh, haha, but of course.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]Anyhow, we only have three minor problems left now.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]First off, we need to use spraypaint to cover up the smoke damaged wall here. Let me show you how it works first. After that, you have fun with the other two cans.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#3$1", focus="r")]
[name="Potlid"]I think I might've started a few too many fires...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]Next, we have the power plant pipeline's safety valve.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#10$1", focus="r")]
[name="Potlid"]Oh, I couldn't find the kind you wanted. Does that mean...?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Potlid"]Does that mean we won't be able to hand in the truck tomorrow?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]Don't worry. I knew you wouldn't be able to find a model that old.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#11$1", focus="r")]
[name="Potlid"]Ehh...?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]You see, we're getting our truck inspected and upgraded because even though all the other parts are fairly new, the power plant is too old.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]No one cared about it before, but the unions in Big Pillar have been clamoring for standardization.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#8$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]Hah, 'standardization.' Sounds like a pretty cool word, right? You can think of it as setting up rules.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]The old power plant's problems don't bother me, but the union says they're switching over to the top-of-the-line thingies in the ads for our own good, and I think they have a point.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]Anyway, it's because ours is against the rules that we're going to get a new one from a transport company in Carrot's tomorrow. We'll be fine, even if this valve isn't a perfect fit.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]We just have one last run. As long as it gets our ute to its final destination, it's more than enough.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]And if we end up having to use the backup pipeline, then... I'll need you to help me out.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]Just like before, I'll ask you to go down to the power plant to take a look at things, and you'll need to report anything that seems off right away.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#11$1", focus="r")]
[name="Potlid"]Mm... Okay!
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]Finally...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1183_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alanna"]This is the 'Decommissioning Report' we need to hand over to the station when we leave. Once we're gone, we aren't coming back.

[name="Alanna"]Hah, all these silly formalities, right? And they barely gave me any heads up. I asked Thick Palm Parker to teach me how to fill out the form, and it took two whole hours. I didn't have time to take it to the station today.

[name="Alanna"]Huh?

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4081_warmy_1#11$1", focus="r")]

The unfamiliar voice heard through the broadcast belongs to the strange woman she met yesterday. She's holding Alanna's broadcast mic with one hand.
Her other hand is steadily holding her crossbow, with its bolt pressed against the side of Alanna's neck.
She stares at Potlid with a cold glare through the monitoring camera's lens, perhaps noticing the subtle movement of its shift in angle.
[name="All-Transport-Trucks Broadcast"]Anyone not heading to the Grinning Valley can get off now, driver included.
