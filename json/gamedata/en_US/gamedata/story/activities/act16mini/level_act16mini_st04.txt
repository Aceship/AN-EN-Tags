You suddenly remember something.
You remember the huge Rim Billiton logo emblazoned on the laser mining module mounted atop the Rhodes Island landship. You remember seeing it before.
You remember some of the materials that Rhodes Island has gradually been making available to you lately.
Rhodes Island's predecessor, 'Babel,' customized this Rim Billiton mining module that was attacked during the initial shipment.
The mercenary team dispatched by Babel failed to stave off the attack, resulting in the deaths of many people on the transport team.
