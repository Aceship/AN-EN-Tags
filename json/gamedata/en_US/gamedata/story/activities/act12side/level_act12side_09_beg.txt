[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]I wish I could've done that. I also wish that, when I opened my eyes again, all of this would've been over, win or lose.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#4")]
[name="Ernesto"]Too bad. I couldn't.
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]You can't beat me.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]I'm really glad that I identified you two as my greatest foes right at the beginning... We wouldn't have made it this far otherwise.
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]You... You don't seem like those maniacs out there. Why are you doing this?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]Let me tell you how I truly feel, now that it's come to this.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#7")]
[name="Ernesto"]Ms. Candela once said that her father, a former mayor of this city, was a useless piece of trash who, propped up by the Leithanian government, could do nothing but take bribes.
[name="Ernesto"]Before the outraged citizens could kick his office's door in, he fled the country with his wife and daughter.
[name="Ernesto"]Although her father was a piece of trash through and through, as the daughter of the scumbag, she followed her father first to Kazimierz, then to Victoria.
[name="Ernesto"]Through her father, she learned all the ways that wealth could be used. She learned the very meaning of wealth.
[name="Ernesto"]Then, she came back to the city and became its mayor.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#4")]
[name="Ernesto"]At a time when the resistance was nothing but a huge failure, the city found itself producing the finest liquor, coffee, and confectionaries.
[name="Ernesto"]Dossoles tequila can even be found in Leithanien and Columbia.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]And while the Leithanians and Columbians were bickering at each other, the city transformed into a vacation hotspot of choice among the elite of both sides.
[name="Ernesto"]They had no choice but to follow Ms. Candela's rule: You may never fight here.
[name="Ernesto"]And it's not military might or prowess that makes them willingly follow this rule. It's wealth, entertainment, and all the luxuries this place has to offer.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#7")]
[name="Ernesto"]It's the city's colorful facade.
[delay(time=1)]
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#2")]
[name="Ernesto"]I know that's not how I should see all this.
[name="Ernesto"]But I can't keep myself from thinking this way—
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#4")]
[name="Ernesto"]From a certain point of view, and all things considered, perhaps Ms. Candela loves this country far more than my father.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#7")]
[name="Ernesto"]All he is doing is blindly chasing this construct of a country. He wants a country called Bolívar.
[name="Ernesto"]Its borders were defined when it was still a colony. Its citizens are those who have always lived on these lands.
[name="Ernesto"]What comes next? How will this country take on the Columbians and Leithanians in this conflict? How will it continue to develop as a country?
[name="Ernesto"]He doesn't know. He doesn't actually know what kind of a country Bolívar is.
[name="Ernesto"]But Ms. Candela found a path forward. She found meaning in its existence, and she plans to make that meaning a reality.
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]That's a load of shit.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]It's better than having nothing but empty promises, no?
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]In that case, why help your father?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#7")]
[name="Ernesto"]From the moment I was born, I've watched my father toil away amid the flames of war. I've watched him go from a spirited man to a quiet one.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6")]
[name="Ernesto"]I know what kind of person my father is. He's not like those men who chose to give in to the modern world.
[name="Ernesto"]Even though working under Ms. Candela put these thoughts in my head, that doesn't mean I will betray my father.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#4")]
[name="Ernesto"]But I also cannot deny that these thoughts are getting stronger and stronger. So much that I'm slowly starting to consider the other possibilities there are.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]That's why this operation is something like a crossroads for me.
[name="Ernesto"]I will wholeheartedly help my father in his cause. If he succeeds, then I will continue to help him.
[name="Ernesto"]If he fails, then I will accept my change of heart and become Ms. Candela's supporter.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#7")]
[name="Ernesto"]Of course, if I die—
[delay(time=1)]
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]That just means I'm gonna be dead, haha.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]But now is not the time for all of this to end. Not just yet.
[name="Ernesto"]That's why I can't let you through.
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]In that case... we've got nothing to say to each other.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]Right, it's been a pleasure, Miss Ch'en.
[name="Ernesto"]If we'd met under any other circumstance, I would have loved to give you and Miss Lin a proper tour of the city.
[character(name="avg_1013_spchen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]I'll pass.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]I thought you'd say that.
