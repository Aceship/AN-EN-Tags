[name="Pancho"]Cooperation troubles don't get resolved in one night.
[name="Pancho"]But obviously, these two know about the problem, so they've clearly divided up their combat.
[name="Pancho"]This time, it's a lot more nimble than the fighting in Round 1.
[character(name="avg_NPC_017_3")]
[name="D.D.D."]Good to know. So, does that mean their chance of victory has shot up?
[character(name="avg_NPC_017_3",focus=-1)]
[name="Pancho"]Still hard to say. The other contestants'll have their own countermeasures.
[character(name="avg_NPC_017_3")]
[name="D.D.D."]That's true. Trying to hold back LUNG wRATh normally has already proven ineffective, so let's hope the other competitors can show us some new tricks!

[name="Hoshiguma"]Heh, they're right.
[name="Hoshiguma"]And the mood between them's eased a bit too. Wonder if anything happened.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]So it comes from the Iberian period, no wonder...

[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Information on this cruise ship.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]What's so interesting? Did you just say Iberia?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Yeah. The ship's actually a relic from the age of Iberia.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]That early...? Actually, thinking about it, there's no other country that would have stuff like this.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Mhm.
[name="Swire"]And Mayor Candela paid big money to buy it off the Iberians, and for the tech to remodel it.
[name="Swire"]And all this just to have the thing floating out on the city's sea.
[name="Swire"]I don't think there's another person across the whole world who'd do that.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]That sure is some level of luxury.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Speaking of which, Missy, weren't you looking into this Mayor the past two days? Any findings?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Findings... they're still pretty basic so far.
[name="Swire"]This Candela Sanchez, in some sense, is someone who can stand shoulder to shoulder with Chief Wei.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]She's that powerful?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Yeah. It's not exactly the same, but they're both completely wrapped up in their cities, and both have a tight grip on the reins of government.
[character(name="avg_npc_197_1#2")]
[name="Swire"]As a member of the L.G.D., I would absolutely never say I admire someone who builds a city like this.
[character(name="avg_npc_197_1#6")]
[name="Swire"]But as a daughter of the Schwire family, I have to admit, a builder like that is a real tough customer.
[character(name="avg_npc_197_1#5")]
[name="Swire"]If we're saying this city's base is much more solid than it seems, then its superstructure is even crazier than it seems.
[name="Swire"]Agents of three governments come flooding into this city every day, and the news will sometimes report on disputes, even small-scale conflicts, between them.
[character(name="avg_npc_197_1#6")]
[name="Swire"]But the thing is, nobody cares.
[name="Swire"]They come here as an open secret, respect an unwritten code of conduct, and revel in a joy they could never have outside.
[character(name="avg_npc_197_1#5")]
[name="Swire"]Can you picture it?
[name="Swire"]The first time the three sides clashed, Mayor Candela showed up for sure, and used some method we could never imagine to 'talk them over.'
[name="Swire"]And after that, anyone who came to this city had to keep by the rules she set.
[character(name="avg_npc_197_1#2")]
[name="Swire"]But I just don't know what it was. Leverage? Or a political bargaining chip?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Lady Candela has enough armed force on hand to defend this city, that's for sure.
[name="Hoshiguma"]But beyond all of that, I feel like there's a real simple answer, Missy. Haven't you already realized?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Realized what?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#2",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Here's what it is—alcohol, sugar, coffee, and entertainment.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#2",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]How could those things possibly...
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#5",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]It's a time-old tale, Missy. The frugal convert to extravagance, but it's a nightmare to go the other way.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Forget old boys who've been spoiled rotten since childhood. You could even take me. If I suddenly lost something I was real used to and felt was real nice, I'd be struggling for sure.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Not to mention after losing it, I'd have to make do with junk instead.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Sometimes, people's wills just bend like paper, and what Bolívar's like now really doesn't help. If you told me this place was full of people with firm wills, I wouldn't believe you.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#5",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#2",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]It can't have been that smooth as first, but as time went on, nobody could stand up to reject it all. All of this has become some sort of status quo.
[name="Hoshiguma"]But I'll also acknowledge, for being able to decide straight from the start that this was how this city would come to manifest, this Mayor really is phenomenally powerful.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#6")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Powerful to the point that it's frightening.

[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#4")]

[name="Sideroca"]You could say that. It was a mission in Bolívar, helping Eyjafjalla with some geological research on the side. We heard there was a city here, and once we were all done, we put in for a vacation here.
