[name="D.D.D."]As we follow the event's progress, the leading team has already passed the cycling checkpoint, and it's now that we're seeing a change in the contest!
[name="D.D.D."]After the might-and-power LUNG wRATh of Round 1 passed the cycling checkpoint and got to riding, another team's immediately begun to personally deal with them.
[name="D.D.D."]And moreover, they seem to have changed strategies this time.
[name="D.D.D."]Lady Candela, can we invite you to explain to everyone, please!
[Character(name="avg_npc_198_1#2")]
[name="Candela"]Isn't it clear? This bunch know that even attacking all at once doesn't ensure they're an opponent to the team, so they've elected to stall them out, and not to overpower them.
[name="Candela"]Tactics like that put you up very close to those two in the footrace, but plenty of moves get tricky to pull when you're on a vehicle.
[name="Candela"]So here in the cycling segment is where they're opting to do it.
[character(name="avg_npc_198_1#4")]
[name="Candela"]It goes without saying, the results aren't bad.
[character(name="avg_NPC_017_3")]
[name="D.D.D."]Without a doubt. They've gotten just close enough to LUNG wRATh, without moving up to attack. It's been trick after trick to harass them, giving them no way to comfortably pick up the pace.
[name="D.D.D."]We can see just how far behind the leading team LUNG wRATh is!
[name="D.D.D."]They're stuck with a handicap on their bikes, and getting off means falling behind! LUNG wRATh face their biggest crisis in the competition yet!
