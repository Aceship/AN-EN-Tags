[name="D.D.D."]The two of them had a short discussion, and then, for one reason or another, Ch'en leaped into the water by herself.
[name="D.D.D."]Meanwhile, Lin stayed behind on the beach. Looks like she's warming up and picking up sand.
[name="D.D.D."]We already know that Lin can turn sand into glass to use as a weapon. Is she trying to build a glass bridge to cross the ocean?

[name="D.D.D."]Lin is actually 'running' on the ocean's surface!
[Character(name="avg_npc_198_1#5")]
[name="Candela"]No, she isn't running. She's leaping.
[name="Candela"]With the sand she collected, she's synthesizing glass pillars at wherever she lands to give herself her next leap.
[name="Candela"]And to save on sand, she's even jumping on top of whoever happens to be nearby, using them as springboards.
[character(name="avg_npc_198_1#3")]
[name="Candela"]Hahaha, this is good. This is very good!
[character(name="avg_NPC_017_3")]
[name="D.D.D."]Well, that's a hell of a way to cross the water. Never seen anything like it before!
[name="D.D.D."]And this probably means that the two of them talked it over beforehand. There ain't enough springboards out in the ocean, so Ch'en would go first to pave the way for Lin.
[name="D.D.D."]The two of them once again showing just how touching their comradeship can be!
