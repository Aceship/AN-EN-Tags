[name="D.D.D."]This is phenomenal work! Ch'en snuck into an alley to save the trapped Mizuki, and followed it by directly confronting all the other competitors there.
[name="D.D.D."]It seems the other teams have determined LUNG wRATh is too dangerous to keep around, and have all silently accorded to work together.
[name="D.D.D."]But even so, Ch'en isn't cowed one bit, choosing to take up the fight.

[name="D.D.D."]Unlike Ch'en's teeth-gritting clash in the alleyway, Lin's spared only a few moves to hold down the entrance, and deter any team who dares come.
[name="D.D.D."]Is there anyone in this whole championship who can overcome this combination's mere presence?!

[name="Hoshiguma"]That's fair enough, I guess that's just me being used to Ch'en. If she wanted to win now, I'd be out of luck banking on just her swordplay.

[name="Hoshiguma"]C'mon, I'm here because I haven't. Neither has Ch'en, I reckon.
[name="Hoshiguma"]You're right about one thing, though. It's a good thing we've never seen her fight before. That'd put us in the tough position, we'd have to take her in.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#7",focus=2)]

[name="Hoshiguma"]Never thought there'd be a day when she and Ch'en work together, though.
[name="Hoshiguma"]You really do see everything as you get older.
[name="Hoshiguma"]So in the end, who do you think would win, then?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Don't feel like guessing.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Heh, then I'll guess on my own.
[name="Hoshiguma"]In my opinion, if Ch'en had her sword, it'd be hard for Lin Yühsia to ever get near her.
[name="Hoshiguma"]But, if she does let Miss Lin get near, then Ch'en's lost.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Ch'en sure sucks.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]You can't say that either. Ch'en's solid with her kickboxing. Joint locks and grapples and whatever. She's amazing with all our normal training, too.
[name="Hoshiguma"]You saw how decent her accuracy was too, just now.
[name="Hoshiguma"]But in the end, Ch'en's best with a sword.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]So you're implying Lin Yühsia's as good in close-quarters as Ch'en is with her sword.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]More or less.
