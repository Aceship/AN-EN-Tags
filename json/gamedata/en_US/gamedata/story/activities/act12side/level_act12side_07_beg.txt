[name="Pancho"]Ten years ago, I thought Bolívar would find true peace if we chased the Coalition and the Singas out of the country.
[name="Pancho"]I risked my life to fight for True Bolívarians.
[name="Pancho"]In the end, three thousand of my brothers fought to their deaths. If it wasn't for my own brother risking his life to save mine, I would've been shot that day.
[name="Pancho"]And that was the day when I finally realized.
[name="Pancho"]The Coalition, the Singas dynasty's nobles, and True Bolívarians. Not one of them truly wants to save Bolívar. All they are doing is fighting a war.
[name="Pancho"]And no matter how long this war lasts, Bolívar will never see salvation.
[name="Pancho"]To escape the turmoil, I made my way to this city.
[name="Pancho"]In a hopeless country, I found this hopeless city.
[name="Pancho"]And then we have Candela Sanchez, who's the most hopeless of us all.
[name="Pancho"]On this hopeless swath of land, she built a city far more corrupt than all Bolívarian cities combined.
[name="Pancho"]And not only is she enjoying this herself, she is even dragging all those around her into her cesspit of enjoyment.
[name="Pancho"]All of them think they lead a proper life.
[name="Pancho"]They have no idea just how much blood lies underneath them, in the city's sewers and how many scavenging beasts the place is feeding.
[name="Pancho"]She is feeding on the flesh and blood of all those who live in these lands, never to care about their lives.
[name="Pancho"]This city must die, and all of you who indulge in the pleasures this place has to offer must die with it!
[name="Pancho"]The championship's over.
[name="Pancho"]Now, I will take back this city.
[name="Pancho"]If no one else will save this country, I will.
