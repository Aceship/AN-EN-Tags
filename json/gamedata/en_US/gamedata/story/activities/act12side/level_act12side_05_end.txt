[name="D.D.D."]What now? LUNG wRATh have hit a government-issued ambush blockade.
[name="D.D.D."]In all the frenzy, Ernesto's decided to take up the rear, and the two heroines have caught his key and left to press forward.
[name="D.D.D."]Ernesto's combat strength might be as impressive, but with this many enemies, his defeat could only be a matter of time anyway!
[name="D.D.D."]But as for the heroines, they've broken out of the entrapment, but ambushes still lie ahead! Can they really get away without a hitch?
[name="D.D.D."]Oh? They've opened a door on the street and rushed inside!
[name="D.D.D."]This store...
[Character(name="avg_npc_198_1#1")]
[name="Candela"]Is one of Ernesto's.
[character(name="avg_NPC_017_3")]
[name="D.D.D."]So that's their game! Looks like the key Ernesto left them works for sheltering in a shop of his.
[name="D.D.D."]But is this truly going to work out?
[name="D.D.D."]Hold on! Director, switch cameras!
[name="D.D.D."]Alright, that's the REAL game! From another angle it all makes sense. This store has a back door.
[name="D.D.D."]And we can see, there's a passage from that door through to the main street, and it hasn't been discovered by any other team's interference!
[name="D.D.D."]Is this LUNG wRATh's chance, or is it—
