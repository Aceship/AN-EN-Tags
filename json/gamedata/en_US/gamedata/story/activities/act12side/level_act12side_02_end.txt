Accompanied by only a brush of Lin Yühsia's hand on the window next to her, the glass gradually vanishes as if melting.

Straight after, a knife blade appears from her palm, almost colorless, only its reflection of the subtle sunshine rays proving its existence.

[name="D.D.D."]Here we can finally make it out—Lin has the incredible ability to turn glass into weapons! That's one to blow your mind!

[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Same as the Rat King's. She's actually manipulating sand, just in a different kind of way.
[name="Swire"]She's been able to turn sand into glass since she was a kid. I'd always play with it.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Ohh, I get it. Glass is made out of sand, for sure.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Huh. I heard the Rat King could make sandstorms. Can Miss Lin do that?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]I don't know. My guess is she technically could, but wouldn't want to either.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]

[name="D.D.D."]Your thoughts, Mr. Pancho? Do you believe victory this time belongs to them?
[character(name="avg_npc_192_1#1")]
[name="Pancho"]Every member of the team is impressively strong, but their coordination's still half-baked.
[character(name="avg_NPC_017_3")]
[name="D.D.D."]Interesting to hear. It's true, competitions like this get competitors targeting you and taking you out if you throw too much personal power around.

[name="Hoshiguma"]This old guy's got a keen eye. Spotted Ch'en and Lin's biggest issue straight away.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]I agree. Honestly, these two, and Ch'en especially. She knows at least what cooperation is from partnering with you, but she has no idea how Lin Yühsia fights, and her sword was her best weapon. She's doubly bound.
[name="Swire"]And as for Lin Yühsia, that woman wouldn't know how to spell 'cooperation' if it walked up to her in big bold print.
[name="Swire"]I saw her just short of gashing Ch'en several times, relying entirely on Ch'en to dodge her in time.
[name="Swire"]I could die laughing. And the ones who don't know still think they work like two peas in a pod.
[name="Swire"]That Ernesto's smart, I have to admit. He hasn't gotten anywhere near those two.
[name="Swire"]It's the only good call. Not even nine lives would save you.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Not bad, Missy. Observation powers have been getting better and better. I thought I'd have to explain it to you.

[name="Swire"]I've been putting in the effort to take over Ch'en Hui-chieh's job, alright?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]I never doubted that one bit. Just didn't think you'd be making it so fast. Not bad at all.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Stop sighing like you're the old guard above me. I'll dock your wages, that's a threat.

[name="Swire"]Hmph, that sounds more like it.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Seriously, though, come to mention it. Watching them work together like this—it reminds me a little of when I first met Ch'en.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]She was the same back then?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#2",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Nah, try flipping it around. She was pretty much like Miss Lin is now.
[name="Hoshiguma"]If you had that old her and this Miss Lin team up, odds are they'd argue until they came to blows, ha ha.

[name="Ernesto"]How about this...?
[name="Ernesto"]I know you two don't deal too well with each other, but seeing as you are, in fact, a team, at least try and act as much of a team as you can.
[name="Ernesto"]As I mentioned before, you can't use comms during the competition, and you're not just looking for gold, either. You're investigating any possible terrorists, too.
[name="Ernesto"]Sure, individually you two are hugely capable, but doesn't Yan have that saying—don't fear the certain, fear the unlikely?
[name="Ernesto"]So my suggestion is, no matter if we have any pure gold or not, we meet back up here in one hour. Sound good?
[name="Ernesto"]If one's a no-show, the other two play it by ear.

[name="Ernesto"]Um... gonna be honest, here. No question about you two suiting each other, and splitting up is a really, really common tactic in Round 1 for sure.
