[name="Lin Yühsia"]Please don't sell yourself short either, Dad. If you were to take a trip, we wouldn't have anyone look after the flowers at the shop, and the uncles would have one less person to play chess with.

[name="Ch'en"]Who?
[character(name="avg_npc_198_1#5")]

[name="Candela"]Oh, looks like Lady Fumizuki's hiding something from you, even though you are bound to find out.
[Character(name="avg_npc_198_1#1")]
[name="Candela"]Ch'en, my lovely niece, I'm sure you already know, but there are certain formalities that Chief Wei and I must follow given our position, even if we'd rather not.
[name="Candela"]I actually wouldn't have minded if Chief Wei had sent just any old lout off the street... Well, I guess maybe he'd still have to put a little thought into it. Someone like you, perhaps? I would honor them with the same hospitality as I am showing you now.
[name="Candela"]And why does it matter? I invited the Weis and the Rat King here for a holiday.
[name="Candela"]But he knows that will not do, and so do I.
[name="Candela"]He is free to not come, but he must send someone of status. Or it would be tantamount to the Chief of Lungmen disrespecting the Mayor of Dossoles.
[name="Candela"]You would've seen countless headlines in the newspapers of both cities, and way too many things would get unnecessarily problematic.
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]

[name="Candela"]Dossoles's greatest feature, and indeed what it is known for all across the world, is the 'ocean' that surrounds us, and this ship sailing its waters.
[name="Candela"]It's a piece of renovated Iberian technology. It took much blood, sweat and tears to complete. It's one of my finest masterpieces.
[name="Lin Yühsia"]Including the statue on the ship's bow?
[name="Candela"]Hahaha, that's just my own little addition.
[name="Candela"]As for the water of this 'sea,' it's all sourced from the actual, vast ocean to the north.
[name="Candela"]The water gets dirty and starts to stink after a while, so we replace the ocean water at least twice a year.
[name="Candela"]And this season is when most of us here head to the beach. That's why we have the water replaced around this time.
[name="Candela"]Changing the water is in itself a mundane process. Not only that, but we even have to take away a day of fun from our esteemed guests.
[name="Candela"]Nonetheless, I don't want to have our guests play in any filthy seawater either. It would be an insult to Dossoles's fame.
[name="Candela"]And that's how the Dossoles Warrior Champion came to be.
[name="Candela"]This is a variety competition event that takes place all across the city, and it is entirely sponsored by me, at my expense.
[name="Candela"]I will have someone give you a more detailed explanation later if you would like to know more.
[name="Candela"]What you need to know is that the competition's victor will get to press the button that starts the water changing process. It's an honor that's unique to this city alone.

[name="Ernesto"]Pleased to make your acquaintance, lovely ladies. I am the International Trade Management Department's deputy director, Ernesto Salas.
[name="Ernesto"]Please just call me Ernesto.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]I welcome you two to our city.
[name="Ernesto"]If there is anything you would like to know about the city or there is anywhere you would like to visit, please feel free to ask.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]My mission from Lady Candela is to make sure that you feel at home.

[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]Here's how you can get in touch with me or Lady Candela directly.
[name="Ernesto"]And here are the credit cards that the mayor has prepared for you.
[name="Ernesto"]All your transactions within the city may be paid using this card, and there is no credit limit. All your expenses will be paid by the government.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]You can go on the shopping spree of a lifetime if you'd like.

[name="Ernesto"]This is the way the city treats its guests. Please, just accept them.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]Aside from that... It looks like you have some catching up to do, so I will intrude no longer.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]We will be heading to your hotel next. I will wait for you downstairs. Come look for me as soon as you're ready.

[character(name="char_010_chen_summer",name2="avg_npc_036",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]That's good. She's actually pretty capable of the responsibilities that come with the job, if she works on her temperament a little.
