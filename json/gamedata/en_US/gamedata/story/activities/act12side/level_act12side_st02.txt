[name="Hoshiguma"]Eh, Missy, I don't get it. The competition's over, and only now are you excited.
[name="Hoshiguma"]You've been strolling around the streets for the past few days, but it doesn't really look like that's all you're doing either. Is there something out here that piques your interest?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#5",name2="avg_npc_197_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]I'm taking a stroll around alright, but I do have another reason.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]What is it?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]I want to get to know this city.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]How come?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]You see, Bolívar is right out there, past the city's borders. A country under three different governments.
[name="Swire"]The Singas government that's propped up by Leithanien, the Coalition government supported by Columbia, and the True Bolívarians that sprang up to oppose those two governments.
[name="Swire"]I'm sure clashes between those three governments, big and small, are happening all across the country while we're just sitting here.
[name="Swire"]And this city doesn't look like any of the other Bolívarian cities that we stopped at on our way here.
[name="Swire"]You can't say this one's just prosperous. Even I've never seen a place so extravagant, so totally dedicated to leisure.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Don't you think it's strange that a city like this popped up in Bolívar?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Well, I do think it's strange, but this isn't Lungmen, and I can't be bothered to look into it.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]You know, you know everything, but if it's got nothing to do with Lungmen or Ch'en, you never seem to care.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]It's a force of habit. Go on, Missy. You've got an idea or something, don't you?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]If this city was dark and gloomy, then I certainly wouldn't have felt anything off about it. On the contrary, though, it's so full of energy here that it's irritating.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]If every city out there had a heart, then Lungmen's would probably be a lively one, and its blood would be healthy, and vivid red, always getting pumped to the heart to keep it going.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]But Dossoles's heart is way too shady. It keeps on pumping in dirty, black blood, but it doesn't hurt. In fact, it's somehow beating even stronger than our healthy Lungmen.
[name="Swire"]And that makes the place seem like it's got more pep than Lungmen.
[name="Swire"]And let's not even go into how Lungmen very rarely finds itself held back by any external forces. This city is in Bolívar, where the political situation couldn't be more messed up.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Don't you think that's strange?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Oh, that's a good analogy. Really makes it easy to understand.
[name="Hoshiguma"]So you're curious why the city is like this, even when it shouldn't be?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]This city tolerates crime, encourages gambling, and you've got the most voluptuous, spendthrifty kinds here. Each and every day, someone hits it big, while some other poor sod goes bankrupt.
[name="Swire"]This creates the illusion that this city's main sources of income are its tourism and entertainment industries—They attract visitors and squeeze the money out of them.
[name="Swire"]An entertainment industry by itself can't support all of a city's operations, however. That's why the city leaves its entertainment industry and even crime on the streets unchecked, attracting all kinds of sketchy people.
[name="Swire"]And that gives the city its false, unstable prosperity.
[name="Swire"]There's an explanation.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]But is that really how things are?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#2",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Hm... Missy, I kind of think you're overreacting a little.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#2",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]What did you just say?!
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#5",name2="avg_npc_197_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]It makes sense, though. For a pampered lady like you, the way this city works is uncommon and barbaric.
[name="Hoshiguma"]But it's all pretty near and dear to me.
[name="Hoshiguma"]I'm sure you know that Higashi isn't in a much better shape than Bolívar. In Higashi, even when there's a full-scale war outside, the elites holed up inside couldn't care less.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Fundamentally, this city isn't all that different from those cities I know.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Oh, but now that you mention it, it's true that you can't run a city on entertainment and tourism alone.
[name="Hoshiguma"]There aren't any cities like that in Higashi either.
[name="Hoshiguma"]So I guess you should tell me more, Missy. About your discovery.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#5",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]I don't wanna talk about it anymore.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Oh, come on, Missy. It's all my bad, okay?
[name="Hoshiguma"]Waiter, one raspado de verano, please. For the lady.
[character]
[name="Waiter"]Yes, ma'am.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Okay, Missy, don't be mad. Cool off with some shaved ice, okay?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Hmph, do you remember what happened when we came to this city?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Didn't we walk right in as soon as you flashed your card?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]That's me being well-prepared. Lungmen has a trade agreement with Dossoles, so I could come right in with just my card.
[name="Swire"]I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about the other people that were there.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Oh, I remember seeing a few pretty nervous guys trying to get inside. The guards asked them a few questions, but let them through right after.
[name="Hoshiguma"]The guards were pretty friendly, too. They even gave them directions.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Do you remember seeing a lot of factories outside the city center?
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Yes, I did.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Bingo.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Oh, I get it. The political situation is ever-changing in Bolívar, so it's dangerous to rely on trade for daily necessities.
[name="Hoshiguma"]So the city had to take fate into its own hands.
[name="Hoshiguma"]And those poor folks are factory workers.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#4",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]That's right. I asked around at the bar the last couple days. The factories here apparently pay really well.
[name="Swire"]That's why a lot of people take the arduous journey just to come here to work.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]And if they manage to get a good foothold here, that's going to make them a small fortune compared to outside.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Right. It may not make them as much as fighting for the Coalition or Singas, but working here is much safer.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Haha, I'm not sure which is safer, between getting bludgeoned to death in a back alley or dying on the battlefield.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]Stop interrupting. After that, I looked up some old news articles. This city may be known all over Bolívar for its entertainment industry, but its wine, coffee, and sugar are the finest in the country too.
[name="Swire"]All the Bolívarian elites, whether they are from the Coalition, Singas, or True Bolívarians, are buying them up.
[name="Swire"]And even outside, I've seen lots of Bolívarian tequila and coffee back home. I don't remember the exact place they were produced, but I've definitely seen these factories' brands before.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#5",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]The guards are well-equipped and full of energy...
[name="Hoshiguma"]And otherwise, aside from its entertainment and tourism sectors, the city also has a firm grip over a luxury goods industry that no one can ignore.
[name="Hoshiguma"]I get what you mean now. The city may seem chaotic on the surface, but it's actually very stable deep down. It's 100% capable of becoming a proper, methodical city like Lungmen.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Now this is really starting to pique my interest.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#5",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]And here you said I was overreacting.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]I beg your forgiveness, Milady. Your insight is unparalleled. A lowly errand girl like me cannot dare to compare.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]That's some glib tongue you got.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Really though, Missy. Speaking from experience, the answer you seek is actually very simple.
[name="Hoshiguma"]No matter what, those who stand on top will never tolerate a variable out of their control.
[name="Hoshiguma"]If this city is managing to keep this appearance up, then that must mean that, to its ruler, what we think is chaotic here is hardly worth batting an eye over.
[name="Hoshiguma"]In other words, this city has a powerful, crazed mastermind.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]That's my conclusion as well.
[name="Swire"]The mayor is named Candela Sanchez.
[name="Swire"]My family participates in some of the business dealings between Lungmen and Dossoles, but I've really never truly understood her or her city until now.
[name="Swire"]I'm curious just what kind of a person she is to shape her city this way.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]You could talk to her directly. Just tell her who you are. She'll most definitely see you.
[character(name="avg_npc_203_1#1",name2="avg_npc_197_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Swire"]I'll pass. You can fool others with words, but not with the outcomes of your actions.

[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]Very good. I thought you wouldn't figure it out.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]The city's ocean completely engulfs the sun in the sky.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]Papa told me about that before.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]Now, do you know that this city was almost renamed Tressoles, the City of Three Suns?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]Huh? Three suns?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]That's right. Now what do you think the third sun is?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]The third sun...?
[name="Rafaela"]Maybe the mayor?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]Hahaha, that's one theory. Ms. Candela is like the city's sun, and this city only exists because of her.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]That's not the right answer, though.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]Huh? It's not?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]The mayor is a prideful person, but she wouldn't compare herself with the sun. Her pride is above even the sun.
[name="Ernesto"]She wouldn't put herself on the same level as two other suns. She would say all three suns are hers.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]Then what's the third sun?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]The answer's simple. It's on your papa's boat.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]He's your papa... He's my step-dad. Eh, is it the pretty gold statue?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]Haha, that's right. That's the city's third sun.
[name="Ernesto"]Supposedly, it took everyone quite a while to persuade Ms. Candela not to go there.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]......
[name="Rafaela"]That sounds kinda lame.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]Is there anything that isn't lame about this city?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]It looks like you enjoy living here though.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]Do I look like I enjoy this place?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]You don't?
[name="Rafaela"]I kind of think you've been enjoying working for the mayor the last few years.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]If that's the case, why would I help Father?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]No idea. I've always thought you weren't going to.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]*Sigh*... Your intuition is always so on point.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rafaela"]And here you just called me a klutz.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]Hahaha...
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_421_laplum_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]Anyway, let's get back to preparing for the match.
