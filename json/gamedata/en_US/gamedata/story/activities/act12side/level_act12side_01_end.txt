[name="Ch'en"]You own this shop?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]That's right. It's just the place you're looking for.
[name="Ernesto"]I've opened a handful of these stores throughout the city. Call it an income stream.
[name="Ernesto"]We carry all sorts of weapons, as a matter of course, but can I ask, why are you looking to change, Miss Ch'en?
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]
[name="Ch'en"]My sword isn't that suited to competitive stuff like this.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6")]
[name="Ernesto"]Hm... Honestly, the blade you carry doesn't pose any kind of problem.
[name="Ernesto"]There's a mountain of competitors with weapons and tricks a whole lot worse than that up their sleeves. Swords aren't high on the danger scale.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]Which is to say: even if you don't use yours, others will use theirs.
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]
[name="Ch'en"]Doesn't matter. I'm not good with mercy.
[name="Ch'en"]Just give me something that won't do too much damage to a human body.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6")]
[name="Ernesto"]Well, in that case... try a high-pressure water gun like this.
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]
[name="Ch'en"]A water gun?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]Oh, it's a fairly specialized weapon. Fires high-pressure water rounds, hits hard, but won't cause major injury.
[name="Ernesto"]Do you know how to work a crossbow?
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]
[name="Ch'en"]I've never used one in the field, but I didn't do bad on my shooting course.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]Let's give it a try.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]But before that, I'll explain the competition in detail.
[name="Ernesto"]Firstly, its formal name is the 'Dossoles Warrior Champion.'
[name="Ernesto"]It takes place across the entire city. The Mayor's purchased a huge number of drones and cams, as well as low-altitude aircraft, so nobody will miss a single moment.
[name="Ernesto"]Not even the darkest, dankest corners of the city. Once the competition starts, we'll have drones custom-geared to follow each and every team too.
[name="Ernesto"]And once the time hits, the TV station will split up into different main stages, making it convenient for the people to view the teams or content that they want.
[character(name="avg_npc_196_1#1")]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]A truly loathsome level of consideration.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]Ms. Candela's spared no effort in this respect.

[Delay(time=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]Okay. Before the official competition was ten days of prelims, which is what you just took part in.
[name="Ernesto"]Every day, there've been two to three prelims held all over the city.
[name="Lin Yühsia"]Were they all melees like that?
[name="Ernesto"]No. I don't know whether to call you lucky or unlucky, honestly. You crashed the single most dangerous kind.
[name="Ernesto"]There's been a huge variety of prelim types, like eating contests, racewalks, sprints, et cetera. The scrimmage topped everything else for risk.
[name="Lin Yühsia"]But the reward was just as high?
[name="Ernesto"]That's right. No other prelim reward would've ever been as generous as the pure gold statue you got.
[name="Ernesto"]And that's why so many people join the scrimmage, even though it's so dangerous.

[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6")]
[name="Ernesto"]Aha, your reactions tell me you two are very astute.
[name="Ernesto"]I imagine you're worried that the competition won't be kind to entrants who won the more entertainment-focused prelims.
[name="Ernesto"]I'll cut straight to the chase, then. No, it won't be an easy time for them.
[name="Ernesto"]Like I said, people want to see more than simple stamina matches. It's a fight to excite. That's why the weaker ones are up against greater threats.
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]
[name="Ch'en"]...Hmph.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]But you don't need to worry too much, Miss Ch'en. The Mayor's taken that into account. There's an article in the rules on it.
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]
[name="Ch'en"]Oh?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]Have you noticed another problem?
[name="Ernesto"]The competition doesn't restrict Originium Arts. If someone could boost their own speed with it—
[name="Ernesto"]—just to exaggerate, if they could reach the goal in an instant, then that'd be tough luck to everyone else, right?
[character(name="avg_npc_196_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_summer",focus=1)]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]I assume people like that must exist.
[character(name="avg_npc_196_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_summer",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]How couldn't they? Even without Arts, Kuranta naturally outperform others in a race.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]They do exist, of course. To counteract that, the Mayor is giving the viewers the right to choose.
[character(name="avg_npc_196_1#1")]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]The audience decides who the true winner is?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]To be precise, the audience decides who doesn't deserve to be a winner.
[name="Ernesto"]After every round of the competition, there'll be a viewer voting segment, and the votes could completely reshape the final rankings.
[name="Ernesto"]Using flashy means to gain victory is naturally self-explanatory.
[name="Ernesto"]Winning too boring might get you eliminated, but drop enough jaws and you could tip the scales when you'd otherwise fall just short.
[name="Ernesto"]Of course, there's no guarantee that's how it goes.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]With all of that, no one knows who the winner truly is, until the final moment.
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]
[name="Ch'en"]Too boring?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]Right. And not just in combat.
[name="Ernesto"]Dazzling fights are the most direct way to make eyes boggle, but blindsiding with actions can net you cheers too.
[name="Ernesto"]That's the rule that gives contestants a fighting chance, even if they're wipeouts in combat.
[character(name="avg_npc_196_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_summer",focus=1)]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]A lesson learned from Kazimierz.
[character(name="avg_npc_196_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_summer",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Right, true. I remember the Major had similar rules.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6")]
[name="Ernesto"]You two really have seen it all. The Mayor's visited Kazimierz several times before. Apparently, her trade agreement with Lungmen was signed there too.
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]
[name="Ch'en"]So Wei Yenwu went out there as well...

[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]In any case, these are rules that favor the strong, so expect plenty of those who scraped through the prelims for a prize will have to forfeit at the official thing.
[name="Ernesto"]That's why the number of teams competing always changes a little.
[name="Ernesto"]In short, this is a contest with no differentiation, no limits, and no holds barred on the road to victory—but—the winner needs the whole city's approval.
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]
[name="Ch'en"]I'm not that invested in winning or losing this.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]I know that. Your goal is to use the championship to carry out your mission from Ms. Candela, right? I'll be there to help with that, too.
[character(name="avg_npc_196_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_summer",focus=1)]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]If we lose immediately, there'll be no investigation to speak of.
[character(name="avg_npc_196_1#1",name2="char_010_chen_summer",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]I know.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#5")]
[name="Ernesto"]Haha, that's for sure. And the two of you have probably noticed, the battle for popularity runs through the whole championship. In other words, it began the moment the preliminaries did.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]And given how you entered midway into the scrimmage and stomped all over peak danger, it might not be a stretch to say your team is the hottest topic right now.
[name="Ernesto"]You can think of winning as a service to your goal, and enjoy what the competition has for you.
[character(name="avg_npc_196_1#1")]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]We'll see. Let's talk concrete details.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]Sure thing.
[name="Ernesto"]Come over here. I'll explain with a map.

[name="Ernesto"]The competition's split into three rounds.
[name="Ernesto"]Round 1, you're looking for gold in an empty neighborhood.
[name="Ernesto"]There are twenty bars of pure gold to find in this area, and competing teams need at least one. Hand them in to staff at the workers' area afterward, and you're through.
[character(name="char_010_chen_summer")]
[name="Ch'en"]In a residential neighborhood?
[name="Ernesto"]Right. During the competition, everyone living in this area will be housed in hotels elsewhere, and the city government will cover their expenses.
[name="Ernesto"]They'll cover the costs of any and all damage to housing, equipment, et cetera, as a result of the competition, too.
[name="Ernesto"]Most look forward to it, thanks to that. There are even some dying to compete, just so they can smash their own homes up to get them rebuilt free of charge.
[name="Ch'en"]......
[name="Lin Yühsia"]Find gold, fight over it, and then make for the handover. Heh, violence seems almost assured.
[name="Ernesto"]That's right. Some choose to search, some to steal, and some to cut down on rival numbers first.
[name="Ernesto"]Round 1 won't end until the last of the gold is handed in to staff.
[name="Lin Yühsia"]If my guess isn't wildly off, the gold is also part of the prize?
[name="Ernesto"]It sure is. Nothing's stopping you if you want more gold and don't actively hand it in, but you shoulder all the corresponding risk as well.
[name="Lin Yühsia"]If one person acquires all the pure gold, then what?
[name="Ernesto"]Hm... theoretically, it's possible, but practically, it's never happened before, so I'm not sure myself.
[name="Ernesto"]Is that what you're planning, Miss Lin?
[name="Lin Yühsia"]I haven't the interest.

[name="Ernesto"]Once Round 1 is over, there'll be two days' downtime, where the victors are invited to take part in all sorts of spin-off events, and attend a bunch of fancy dinner parties.
[name="Ernesto"]Good for bolstering your popularity outside the arena, in a sense.
[name="Ernesto"]Then it's Round 2. You should be relatively familiar with it; it's a traditional triathlon event.
[name="Ch'en"]Traditional?
[name="Ernesto"]Traditional.
[name="Ernesto"]First you run a route along the beach, then cycle a circuit around the city, and finally, return to the start at the beach for a swim, all the way until the finish: a cruise ship in the middle of the sea.
[name="Ernesto"]But, of course, there's all kinds of ways to win.
[name="Lin Yühsia"]During the race and cycling, I assume you're allowed to leave the main streets.
[name="Ernesto"]Certainly. However, the Mayor has put a substantial fighting force to block the shortcuts, so essentially, taking them means a violent breakthrough.
[name="Lin Yühsia"]Heh. As expected.

[name="Ernesto"]After Round 2 ends, there's two days of downtime just like Round 1, but these ones will be more of a pure rest.
[name="Ernesto"]The victors get the pleasure of all the entertainment and facilities aboard a cruise ship normally reserved for the rich, free of charge.
[name="Ernesto"]Honestly, it's the part a lot of competitors aim for when they're entering, but it's not the end of things.
[name="Ch'en"]Why not?
[name="Ernesto"]Because of Round 3, the final round of the competition. Highly simple, and highly cruel.
[name="Ernesto"]It's a battle royale with the whole ship as fair game. Survive until you're the last team standing to be crowned winner.
[name="Ernesto"]Which means, in Round 3, there's practically no space for clever tricks.
[name="Ch'en"]Understood.

[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]That's right. And it's not like there aren't limits, too.
[name="Ernesto"]You aren't allowed communications equipment during the contest. That means you need to have your plan ready from the start, and if your team splinters, then you've got to be ready for them to come at you.
