[name="D.D.D."]The rules are simple as could be. First you run, then you ride, and finally you swim!
[name="D.D.D."]Obstructing competitors? No problem! As long as one of your teammates finishes, you pass!
[name="D.D.D."]Shortcuts are fair game, but careful of who's lying within the alleys! They're not gonna roll over and let you through!
[name="D.D.D."]Furthermore, if you reach the finish, but the cycling and swimming checkpoints never saw you, then that's not gonna count!
[name="D.D.D."]In other words, contestants, nothing's stopping you from spinning around and diving in at the start line—if you wanna be the laughing stock of the whole city.
[name="D.D.D."]If you're someone who's got it made and you wanna hitch on a low-altitude aircraft, sure!
[name="D.D.D."]But, if the audience doesn't like that, you might just get booted out at the votes!
[name="D.D.D."]Further, as fifteen teams directly passed Round 1, along with one team being revived thanks to audience voting, sixteen teams in total made it out.
[name="D.D.D."]Thus, eight teams will pass Round 2.
[name="D.D.D."]That's the first eight teams to make it who get the right to pass!
[name="D.D.D."]Well, then, let's invite those sixteen teams up onto the stage!

[name="Sideroca"]Besides, we have Sussurro with us. We'll be fine, right?
[character(name="avg_npc_199_1#1")]
[name="Sussurro"]Yes. I'm well aware of Eyjafjalla's condition.
[name="Sussurro"]In my honest opinion, you should worry more about yourself than if you're troubling anyone else.
[name="Sussurro"]You spend more time indoors than the average person, and that doesn't just have repercussions on your body, but your mental health as well.
[character(name="avg_npc_199_1#6")]
[name="Sussurro"]That's why I, as a doctor, endorsed bringing you here, Eyjafjalla.

[name="Sideroca"]They ran into some trouble, but I heard over the screen that the Doctor took a group on vacation somewhere.
[name="Sideroca"]It's only right that Eyjafjalla and the rest of us get one too.
[character(name="avg_npc_190_1#2",name2="avg_npc_206_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Eyjafjalla"]No, I came voluntarily to carry out geological research, and if I hold up everyone else...

[name="Sideroca"]Aw, come on, now, don't you worry so much.
[character(name="avg_npc_190_1#2",name2="avg_npc_206_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Sideroca"]We came here on legitimate grounds, too. Rhodes Island wants to set up a branch office here, and we've never been able to get the mayor's approval.
[name="Sideroca"]Amiya's had us come here as a liaison.
[character(name="avg_npc_190_1#4",name2="avg_npc_206_1#8",focus=2)]
