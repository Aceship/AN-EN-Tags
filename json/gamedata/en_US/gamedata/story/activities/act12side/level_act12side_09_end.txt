[name="Candela"]You merely failed. It's that simple.
[name="Candela"]You lived in the city you despise the most for decades, complaining about the three governments, yet you accepted the backing of one of them just to overthrow me.
[name="Candela"]Let me guess. It's probably someone from the Leithanian side. Oh, I even have a good idea who it might be.
[name="Candela"]Tell me, Pancho. What was going on in your mind that you turned to those ruthless men for help?

[name="Candela"]You are not the kind of man I described. You wish to save this country from the bottom of your heart, and that earned you this seat right now.
[name="Candela"]However, you must be punished for your failure, so I will treat you as their leader nonetheless. Makes things easier that way.
[name="Candela"]I've never thought myself righteous, dear old Pancho.
