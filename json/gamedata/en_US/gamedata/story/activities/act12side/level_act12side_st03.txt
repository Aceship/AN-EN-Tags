[name="Ernesto"]I just want to say one thing, Miss Ch'en.
[name="Ernesto"]Perhaps you'll come to have a different opinion about all this after I'm done.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]I'm listening.

[name="Ernesto"]Miss Ch'en, how familiar are you with Bolívar's history?
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]Can't say I know much.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#6",name2="avg_1013_spchen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ernesto"]Right. You studied abroad in Victoria, and Victoria hasn't really meddled in Bolívar's affairs that much. If you haven't ever gone out of your way to look into our history, I can't fault you for not being familiar with the subject.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#1")]
[name="Ernesto"]Before Iberia discovered this place, it was nothing more than a plain called Bolívar.
[name="Ernesto"]The Iberians found many Originium veins here, and that's why they decided to stay and turn it into a colony.
[name="Ernesto"]Then, one way or another, Iberia's rule here came to an end.
[name="Ernesto"]After a period of chaos that lasted 130 years, the Leithanians came.
[name="Ernesto"]And that's how Bolívar became a Leithanian dependency.
[name="Ernesto"]About two centuries ago, Bolívar evolved from a dependency to a vassal state. That's the Singas dynasty.
[name="Ernesto"]You could say that was when Bolívar became the Bolívar we know, although the Singas dynasty's subjects never called themselves Bolívarians.
[name="Ernesto"]Then, during the Witch King's reign, Leithanien tried to stir up civil unrest in Columbia through Bolívar.
[character(name="avg_486_espumo_1#7")]
[name="Ernesto"]But not only did their efforts fail, Bolívar was actually invaded by Columbia, and that was when the Coalition government was established.
[name="Ernesto"]And from then on, Bolívar was split between both Columbia and Leithanien.
[name="Ernesto"]Leithanien didn't really care about Bolívar that much, and while Columbia was teeming with ambition, Bolívar was too big for it to engulf at once.
[name="Ernesto"]And that's how this tug-of-war started.
[name="Ernesto"]Then, unable to bear the situation any longer, the Bolívarians chose to take up arms.
[name="Ernesto"]They formed a resistance movement and called themselves True Bolívarians, and they swore they would make Bolívar a real country one day.
[name="Ernesto"]Unfortunately, things only took a turn for the worse. True Bolívarians's establishment only dragged Bolívar into even deeper waters.
[name="Ernesto"]In the end, this is the mess that Bolívar has found itself in.
[name="Ernesto"]The Coalition government, the Singas dynasty, and True Bolívarians. The three sides are in a perpetual war with no end in sight.
[name="Ernesto"]Not only that, but this city Dossoles emerged out of the chaos.
[name="Ernesto"]Under Ms. Candela's management, not only is the city well-liked by all three governments, but all three of them even owe Ms. Candela many a time.
[name="Ernesto"]That's because this city has resources that they can't just ignore, and Ms. Candela also has the power to defend this city.
[name="Ernesto"]And so, the city has become a place that all Bolívarians set their sights on.
[name="Ernesto"]Every Bolívarian who's fed up with war dreams of saving up enough money to come here for a vacation, or even get a fresh start here.

[name="Ernesto"]Let's say the three governments are still intent on uniting all of Bolívar. That's something that would never cross Ms. Candela's mind.

[name="Ernesto"]To put it bluntly, Miss Ch'en, this city's prosperity was built on top of the pain and suffering of all Bolívarians.
[name="Ernesto"]And the more prosperous it is, the less hope this country has.
[name="Ernesto"]This is a fact that many of those who truly love Bolívar cannot accept.

[name="Ch'en"]Not long ago, I found myself caught in a conspiracy far more complicated than this one. The only thing I got out of it was the realization of my own weakness.
[name="Ch'en"]But, at the very least, I still dare to say this: There is no justice in spreading terror.

[name="Ch'en"]We're locked in your shop. That's pretty suspicious.
[name="Ch'en"]Effective, but also very rash, and I doubt you didn't consider the possibility that it was going to blow your cover.
[name="Ch'en"]So I was thinking you might still have a trick up your sleeve.
[name="Ch'en"]But suppose you are the mastermind behind all this, I don't think any tricks up your sleeve could make up for your cover being blown.
[name="Ch'en"]Then I figured it out. If your was never that important to begin with... In other words, if getting your cover blown never mattered to you in the first place...
[name="Ch'en"]Then it all starts to make sense.
[name="Ch'en"]Your thinking is that, it would be all the better if you managed to stall us, but even if that didn't work out and you ended up getting your cover blown, all that would lead to is this situation that we find ourselves in now.
[name="Ch'en"]I would see you as the one behind all this, unable to get a glimpse of what's behind you.
