[name="Matterhorn"]     North Kjerag-style stir-fried greens, sprinkled with a little Rhodes Island Special Seasoning....
[name="Matterhorn"]     And we're done.
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#5")]
[name="Gummy"]     Wow! Looks delicious!
[Character(name="char_199_yak_1")]
[name="Matterhorn"]       You flatter me.
[name="Matterhorn"]     Such leafy greens are rare in Kjerag, so I don't often get to cook dishes like this. Your approval brings me joy.
[name="Matterhorn"]     Things are different in the snowfields of Kjerag. Many goods are hard to come by, even with money. It's not like here on this landship, where supplies are so plentiful.
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#3",name2="char_199_yak_1",focus=1)]
[name="Gummy"]     Supplies.... I think I heard Closure say something about that.
[name="Gummy"]     I guess Rhodes Island has like a special procurement channel that brings supplies and stuff to the ship.
[name="Gummy"]     They have bases all over the place, so we can get all kinds of different ingredients from different places.
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#3",name2="char_199_yak_1",focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"]     That explains it. But they really have bases all over?
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#3",name2="char_199_yak_1",focus=1)]
[name="Gummy"]     Um... I guess they're like offices or something? I don't really get this stuff.
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#2",name2="char_199_yak_1",focus=1)]
[name="Gummy"]     That reminds me, wasn't there a wishlist on the bulletin board outside the cafeteria? If there's anything special you like to eat, you can write it up there!
[name="Gummy"]     I heard those pretty girls in procurement check it every day!
[character]
[name="Procurement Agent A"]     You're too sweet, Gummy! Call me pretty again and I'll bring you back some candy next time.
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#5")]
[name="Gummy"]     You're gorgeous!
[character]
[name="Procurement Agent A"]     Atta-girl.
[name="Procurement Agent B"]     Seriously...?
[name="Procurement Agent B"]     Matterhorn, right? Just make a note of whatever you need on that bulletin board there and we'll procure it for you, if we get the chance.
[Character(name="char_199_yak_1")]
[name="Matterhorn"]     I understand. I'll make use of it if I find myself in need. Your efforts humble me.
[character]
[name="Procurement Agent B"]     No need to go that far. This is our job, after all.
[name="Procurement Agent A"]     What's with the stiffness? We're all friends here. Loosen up and talk like human beings already.
[name="Procurement Agent B"]     You need to take our work more seriously!
[name="Procurement Agent B"]     Don't mind her. We have things to do, so we'll get out of your hair for now.

[name="Gummy"]     Hehe. Everybody's so nice. Last time we moored by a city, Closure even took me shopping with her!
[name="Gummy"]     The stuff she bought was kinda weird.... But I still had fun!
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#5",name2="char_199_yak_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"]     Haha, I heard about that. Dr. Kal'tsit was very upset when she bought a big stone mask?
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#5",name2="char_199_yak_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Gummy"]     Ahahahaha. Yeah! That mask was so creepy! I tried it on once.
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#5",name2="char_199_yak_1",focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"]     Next time you see something so strange, perhaps you shouldn't touch it.
[Character(name="char_199_yak_1")]
[name="Matterhorn"]     Ah, the food has cooled down and the temperature is perfect.
[name="Matterhorn"]     Mm. It's salty. This flavor may be a little bit much...
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#5",name2="char_199_yak_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Gummy"]     Don't worry, I'm sure it's great.
[name="Gummy"]     Do you think I could try some? Can I? Please let me have some, Uncle Matterhorn!

[name="Gummy"]     It's great!!
[name="Gummy"]     The veggies are crunchy and juicy and super refreshing and seasoned juuust right. It's really, really good!
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#5",name2="char_199_yak_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"]     O- oh? I appreciate the compliment.
[name="Matterhorn"]     But I think you're exaggerating a bit. This is a simple recipe designed for home cooking. I can put a copy up in the kitchen for everyone to try.
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#5",name2="char_199_yak_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Gummy"]     Hooray!
[name="Gummy"]     I'll also let you try my secret recipe for Ursus frozen vegetable soup, Uncle Matterhorn. It's super healthy! Ooh, it'll be like a trade~
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#5",name2="char_199_yak_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Matterhorn"]     Sounds delicious. I'll give it a try the next time I'm preparing a midnight snack for the Ladies.
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#5",name2="char_199_yak_1#5",focus=1)]

[name="Matterhorn"]     It's for the Doctor, isn't it? It will get cold if we leave it any longer, and that will affect the taste.... won't it?
[Character(name="char_196_sunbr_1#3")]

[name="Matterhorn"]     Stealing food from the kitchen again? There's no need for that. If you're hungry, just go to the cafeteria.
[name="Matterhorn"]     Did you not learn your lesson last time? I recall a logistics operator telling you if you were caught using your powers to take food or ingredients without permission again, you would be punished appropriately.
[Character(name="char_199_yak_1",name2="char_355_ethan_1",focus=2)]

[name="Ethan"]     I dunno what's bothering you. But just some advice from ol' Ethan, take a look at the big picture, and don't do this to yourself.

[name="Ethan"]     Hey, changing the subject, I just wanna ask, what's cooking in your pot over there? Smells really good.

[name="Matterhorn"]     ........That's braised beastmeat. It's ready to go. I'm about to sprinkle some cheese on it.
[name="Matterhorn"]     It's a traditional Kjerag dish. Snowlanders all grow up eating it. I've made some slight adjustments to make the beastmeat more tender.

[name="Ethan"]     That Feline girl named Ensia, she's your "Young Lady," isn't she?
[name="Ethan"]     Real sweet of her brother to send you along to feed her home cooking. He worried the foreign stuff won't agree with her?
[name="Ethan"]     So that's the "Young Lady." Where's the "Old Lady?"
[Character(name="char_199_yak_1")]
[name="Matterhorn"]     ...What exactly are you asking?
[name="Matterhorn"]     The matter of the Ladies is the Master's private affair. You'd best not ask such questions.
[Character(name="char_355_ethan_1")]
[name="Ethan"]     Whew, that's a scary face. Chill, I'm not dumb enough to go sticking my nose into rich people business.
[Character(name="char_199_yak_1")]
[name="Matterhorn"]     So....?
[name="Matterhorn"]     Ah, pass that sauce bottle over there for me.
[Character(name="char_355_ethan_1")]
[name="Ethan"]     This one? Here you go.
[Character(name="char_199_yak_1")]
[name="Matterhorn"]     Thanks.
[Character(name="char_355_ethan_1")]
[name="Ethan"]     Welcome. Ooh, that's starting to smell good.

[name="Matterhorn"]     And we're done. It's just plain fried beastmeat. But I made a few substitutions. It should taste all right.
[name="Matterhorn"]     There's bread in the basket over there, and there should be rice in the pot next to it. You can have whatever you like. I need to bring this to the Young Lady now.
[name="Matterhorn"]     Remember to wash your hands before you eat.
