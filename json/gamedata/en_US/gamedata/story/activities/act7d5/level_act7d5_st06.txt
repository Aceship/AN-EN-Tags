[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     This is it!
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Too slow!
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     Shit!
[name="Fang"]     But...!
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     That's enough for today.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     Phew....
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Not bad, Fang. You blocked it this time.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     I'm glad to see you getting more flexible.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Yeah, it's what Instructor Dobermann taught me. Not just about footwork, but about adjusting my speed. I think I'm starting to get the hang of it!
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Right. You have your natural Kuranta speed. It's good for quick attacks, but those aren't worth anything if the enemy blocks them and you have no counter.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Anyway, you passed this field exercise.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Thanks, Instructor Grace!
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     But the next one will be even harder.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     I'll be ready!
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     That's the spirit.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     Fang~
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]     Beagle, did you finish your test? How did it go?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Aw, I didn't pass.... Instructor Fallon has some real sneaky tricks...
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]     Don't get discouraged. You'll get 'em next time.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     How about you? Did you pass?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]     Yeah.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Nice...
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1")]
[name="Kroos"]     Aww, my butt...
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=2)]
[name="Beagle"]     Kroos, are you okay?
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"]     Instructor Tess shot my patootie...
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=2)]
[name="Beagle"]     Huh?
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"]     The test was a sniper war between me and Instructor Tess. We had to hide and find each other. I still don't know how she got behind me!
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Hahahahahaha!
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"]     Don't laugh at me, Uncle Grace!
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     I'll tell you, you got really unlucky. The other sniping instructors just happen to be out for a few days and you got stuck with Tess.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Even I can't keep track of that phantom. My advice is you put the same effort into finding a sniper nest that you do into finding places to nap.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"]     Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"]     I just checked on Hibiscus and Lava. Lava passed, but Hibiscus didn't. They went home already. How did you do?
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=2)]
[name="Beagle"]     Fang passed.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1")]
[name="Kroos"]     Aw, Fang, you traitor!
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]     Why am I a traitor?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Ugh, I failed again. What is wrong with me...?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1",focus=2)]
[name="Fang"]     Don't be discouraged, Beagle, we still have plenty of chances.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_122_beagle_1",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"]     Yeah, it's just a quiz. Nothing to be too upset about. And we still have hell this afternoon.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Haha, that's right. Dobermann let us do your individual tests this morning. But the afternoon group field test? That's all her.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"]     *Sigh* Please. I can already imagine the look on Instructor Dobermann's face when she sees my test results.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Now you're sorry?
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"]     No. Instructor Dobermann said we could go at our own pace. I'm just a late bloomer!
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Hah hah.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     But I'm also worried she'll be disappointed in us...
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     Beagle, Kroos.....
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Okay, seriously, don't be too hard on yourselves. We didn't make these tests so you could pass them. They're there to tell us what to work on.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1")]
[name="Kroos"]     Wow. It feels awful when a guy tells you straight to your face that he's better than you. And you can't even do anything about it!
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     It's the truth. There's a huge skill gap between you trainees and us instructors.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     That's why we're your teachers. That's what we're here for.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     And even if you haven't noticed it yourselves, you've made huge strides since you came to Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     ...He's right.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     Yeah... I guess he is.
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     And really, you girls are doing great. The instructors you went up against are all experts in your respective fields.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Do you have any idea how we got where we are? What we've been through?
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1")]
[name="Kroos"]     No way...
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Yes. Dobermann alone trained us.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Hard to believe as it may be, Dobermann today is a hundred times softer than she used to be.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1")]
[name="Kroos"]     Huh? Are we talking about the same Dobermann? She's soft?
[name="Kroos"]     That's not funny, Uncle Grace.
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     I'm not kidding.

[name="Dobermann"]     Viktor, the enemy doesn't give water breaks!
[name="Dobermann"]     Leah, let's have you learn some basic first aid before you try healing Arts. This bandage work is as much of a mess as you are.
[name="Dobermann"]     We're done for the day. Give me ten laps around the training room! You hear me?

[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1")]
[name="Kroos"]     That bad, huh?
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     The point is still that Dobermann may not be the strongest fighter herself.... Hey, I'll toot my own horn and say I've got a 50/50 shot against her at this point.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"]     Come on, cut the crap.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Hey, a little self-confidence is good for the soul.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Anyway, Dobermann may not be the strongest fighter around, but the tactics and strategies she pulled out of her time with the Bolívarian army are overpowering.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     Bolívar....?
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Yeah. Like the "Bolívarian Civil War" you see on the news. That Bolívar. We all wonder exactly how Dobermann got to be as great as she is, but she never talks that much about her time in Bolívar.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Anyway, at the time, Rhodes Island was just getting going, and they really needed some talent. Then, how do I put this...
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Dobermann was a real soldier back then.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     What does that mean?
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Like, we're all pretty awesome here at Rhodes Island, but our overall atmosphere is still really relaxed, right? We get to have our own lives.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Okay, let me put it this way. If you were with us back then, Kroos, you'd never end up napping in a utility closet. The thought wouldn't even cross your mind.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1")]
[name="Kroos"]     Huh? That sounds like hell.
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     You get what I'm saying? Dobermann's way different now.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     Really. It's hard to imagine the person Instructor Grace is talking about is our Instructor Dobermann.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     Yeah... Dobermann works us hard, and she's kind of scary, but once you get to know her, you can tell she really cares about us.
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     She always really cared about people. Even back then.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     It's just, sometimes, what you do means more than why you do it.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     All right, that's enough chatting for now. You girls pack up, go take a shower, have lunch, and get ready for the group training this afternoon.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     What about you?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Me? I'm going to gather up the other teachers and we'll take your test results to Dobermann.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Oh, I can do that for you.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Really? You can?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Sure. We'll pass Instructor Dobermann's room on the way to the cafeteria. 
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     Oh. I'll go too.
[Character(name="char_124_kroos_1")]
[name="Kroos"]     Um, I'll pass. I'm in no hurry to see Instructor Dobermann.
[Character(name="char_013_riop")] 
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Thanks a lot, ladies.
[name="Instructor Grace"]     Oh, and uh, don't tell Dobermann what I just told you. Ever.

[name="Dobermann"]     There we go. Thanks.
[name="Dobermann"]     There are currently three factions in Bolívar. The nominal, official government is a puppet controlled by Leithanien, since they led the forces that won the war against Columbia.
[name="Dobermann"]     Then the Autonomous Government resulted from a parliamentary split. They've been looking for a chance to seize power. They're well-funded, and offer a challenge to the puppet government.
[name="Dobermann"]     Last, we have the Bolívarian Resistance, an uprising made up of ordinary people fed up with the struggles of the powerful.
[name="Dobermann"]     I served the Autonomous Government, at the rank of colonel.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]

[name="Beagle"]     I'll wipe down the top of the wardrobe. There must be lots of dust up there.
[name="Beagle"]     Aaahh——choo!
[name="Beagle"]     Oops, something fell down?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     It's... a bunch of metal tags?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     Huh?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     These are.... name plates.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Name plates? Like the ID cards we have at Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Yes. Soldiers in the army get these plates issued with their name and unit number, for identification.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Ah, really.
[name="Beagle"]     Can I see them?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Take a look.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     A... lan. Ju..... an. Jo.... se. I can read the names, but I can't make sense of these abbreviations...
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Those indicate some things about the units they served in. Don't worry about them.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     If you have their name plates, does that mean they're...
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Yes. They're all dead.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Oh. So, were, were they important people to you?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     Important...?

[name="???"]     Colonel, your men died bravely.
[name="???"]     Don't grieve for them. Their deaths have saved my career, and yours. You won't be reprimanded by the brass.
[name="???"]     An investigation? No one will remember these things.
[name="???"]     The truth? Colonel, people need pretty, or at least decent results. They don't care about the truth.
[name="???"]     Colonel, remember your place. And don't forget who it was who raised you up from a common soldier to the command you hold today!

[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     I didn't know them well. We barely spoke.
[name="Dobermann"]     But yes. They are important to me.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Huh?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     ........We're just about done cleaning. Come here.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Um, did I do something wrong, Instructor?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     No. I wasn't trying to hide them. That's why they were just kind of left up there.
[name="Dobermann"]     But your questions got me thinking. So I want to talk to you two.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Oh, well, I'm honored!
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     Relax. Just have a seat.
[name="Dobermann"]     I will tell you about my past at some point, but not now.
[name="Dobermann"]     For now, I just want to ask you a question.
[name="Dobermann"]     What do you think is the defining characteristic of a soldier?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Ah? Is this... a test?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     No. There are no wrong answers.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Phew.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Let's see, um.... combat proficiency?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Most people learn to fight. The operators here all do, and you two will. It's not something unique.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Is it being able to use some kind of awesome weapon?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     It's true that many manufactured weapons are readily accessible to the military....
[name="Dobermann"]     But as you've seen here at Rhodes Island, there's always people who have other ways of acquiring such things.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     There's a lot of them?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Yes.... That is a big one, the military usually has a numerical advantage unmatched by civilian organizations.
[name="Dobermann"]    Rhodes Island today can only compare the standing army of maybe a backwater nomadic city in a small country.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Whaa? I thought Rhodes Island was really powerful...
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     For a non-governmental organization, Rhodes Island has done very well for itself. But we couldn't dream of challenging a state.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     But we have such amazing operators. Like Skyfire, she goes "swoosh" with her staff and everything goes "fwoom!"
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     But there's only so much you can do in the face of an overwhelming numbers.
[name="Fang"]     Do you remember Gus, from the garrison? He was the toughest guy there by far, but if a dozen men ganged up on him...
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Exactly. Numbers change the calculation even for a mediocre combatant. One Beagle couldn't take on Skyfire. But what about ten, or a hundred Beagles? Think about it.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     A- a hundred mes? We- we could crush Skyfire...
[name="Beagle"]     Sorry, Skyfire....
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     Heh. Exactly. The number of times a lone individual has used her individual strength to influence warfare on a national scale is zero. In the entire recorded history of human conflict.
[name="Dobermann"]     Anyway.... To digress a little, there's a reason I haven't been systematically explaining the Army to you in your prep courses. There's just no value to it.
[name="Dobermann"]     My greatest hope is that you'll never have a chance to apply any of this knowledge. This little lesson here is completely voluntary.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     So numbers aren't the answer either?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Well, it's an answer, but it's more of a descriptor of the military itself, rather than a soldier.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Hmmm....
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Um. Is it following orders?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     What makes you say that?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     I just thought back to our time at the garrison. The captain said that as a soldier, you have to follow orders no matter what.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Correct.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Huh? I got it right!
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     You did. The defining characteristic of a soldier is obedience to the chain of command.
[name="Dobermann"]     There's a saying: the best soldier is one who can't think. An army does not need soldiers to think. Only to follow orders.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     But isn't that kind of cruel?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     War is cruel. And if you must engage in it, giving up thought could be a kind of relief.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     But....
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     Isn't it cruel that you have these questions at all? Aren't soldiers human?
[name="Dobermann"]     Obviously, a soldier is not a machine. He comes closer to death than anyone, and he knows better than anyone exactly what it is he is facing.
[name="Dobermann"]     Can a soldier still muster up morale when he knows he's carrying out an incredibly stupid order?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     I think... no?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     Of course not. So when faced with such a situation, you have two choices. Do you know what they are?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang & Beagle"]     ...No.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     One is to prevent the soldier from noticing the order is incredibly stupid.
[name="Dobermann"]     But that's difficult. The men on the front lines know exactly what kind of danger they are facing. You can't fool them.
[name="Dobermann"]     If you could, you could've made a better choice.
[name="Dobermann"]     And that other choice is to just issue the correct orders.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Huh?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     It may sound a bit silly, but it's the truth. How else do you get a soldier to surrender his inclination to question orders?
[name="Dobermann"]     How do you get him to relax, and trust in his command?
[name="Dobermann"]     It's simple. Just issue convincing, correct orders from the beginning.
[name="Dobermann"]     But not everyone makes the right choice.
[name="Dobermann"]     After leaving the Autonomous Government, I moved to join the Resistance. But in the end I left. Because it wasn't any different there.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Woah. Instructor Dobermann even joined the Resistance?!
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Yes. There's a picture in the second drawer under the wardrobe. Take a look
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     Wowww. You looked so cool back then, Instructor.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     I wanna see!
[name="Fang"]     Woah. She did!
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     Put it back when you're done.
[name="Dobermann"]     Things didn't go well there either. And eventually I left Bolívar and came to Rhodes Island.
[name="Dobermann"]     My expectations were low.
[name="Dobermann"]     But I was pleasantly surprised.
[name="Dobermann"]     A soldier knows when he's been given a stupid order, but he may not know what to do about it.
[name="Dobermann"]     That's another reason you need the right orders.
[name="Dobermann"]     And Rhodes Island provides those.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     (whispering) Fang, do you get what she's talking about?
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     (whispering) Kinda...
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     Don't worry about it too much. It's just me waxing philosophical.
[name="Dobermann"]     The main point here is you could stand to appreciate Rhodes Island a bit more.
[name="Dobermann"]     You can safely give yourselves to Rhodes Island. Even if you don't think about what you're fighting for, you won't lose anything.
[name="Dobermann"]     There's an age old question: If we know we have to move forward, but forward is always in front of us, how do we know which way to move?
[name="Dobermann"]     There's no answer to that question. But you can at least trust in Rhodes Island when they tell you which way is forward. You can't go wrong moving that way.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Trust in Rhodes Island.... I think... I think I get what you're trying to tell us.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Yeah. Basically, Rhodes Island is a good place?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     ........Heh heh. Yeah. That's about it.
[name="Dobermann"]     It's an pie-in-the-sky paradise that a few idealists are desperately trying to keep going, for the sake of a little hope.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     I know Rhodes Island is good... But is it really that good...?
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]     Heh heh. It might take a while for you girls to realize it.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     All right, that's enough cleaning and chattering. It's time for you two to get some chow.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     Ah! Oh no! It's almost 1!
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     Yep. Thanks for helping me clean up. You have something to eat. I'll be right along.
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Fang"]     Okay, thanks for the lesson, Instructor Dobermann. I need some time to digest it.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Beagle"]     Me too!
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]     Don't take it too seriously.
[name="Dobermann"]     Also, I changed my mind. I think I might put this on one of my tests.
[name="Dobermann"]     And if you two feed me back exactly what I just said, you get a zero.
[Character(name="char_122_beagle_1")]
[name="Beagle"]     Aaaaagh! No way!
[Character(name="char_123_fang_1")]
[name="Fang"]     I- I'll think very carefully about it! Thanks again for your lesson today, Instructor!
