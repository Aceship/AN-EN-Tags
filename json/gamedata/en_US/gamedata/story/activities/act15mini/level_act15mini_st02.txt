[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#11$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Besides, they have to deal with the Ursus, too.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#7$1")]
[name="Santalla"]That's the southernmost city in Sami, isn't it?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Yeah, it's where a lot of Columbian companies have their only branch offices in Sami.
[name="Magallan"]Now that the Ursus route is sealed off, it's the only place the Exploration Society can mount a rescue from.
[name="Magallan"]I'll rendezvous with them and try my best to collect information on the route. After all, nobody's really all that familiar with Sami.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#7$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#8$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#8$1")]

[name="Santalla"]...A Cyclops's cave.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#7$1")]
[name="Typhon"]Yeah, I guess it's my home, too. At least, I grew up there.
