[name="Forest Shaman"](In Sami) I've lived in this forest ever since I was a child. As did my father, his father, and all of our ancestors.

[name="Forest Shaman"](In Sami) When I flip it open, I find myself unable to understand all of its words.
[name="Forest Shaman"](In Sami) I've studied it with my family, and communicated with my ancestors in hopes of understanding of the symbols within.
[name="Forest Shaman"](In Sami) But I feel as though we are still missing something.

Typhon places her palm on the back of Magallan's hand and gently pushes it forward.
The moment they're met with a hint of resistance, she stops pushing forward, and instead reaches forward ahead of Magallan's hand.
She dips her hand into the shadow and pulls it back out. Then, she places it back on Magallan's hand.
[name="Typhon"]See? Nothing to be afraid of.
[name="Magallan"]Mm... I'll give it a try...
Magallan's hand inches forward bit by bit, until her fingertips are finally submerged in the shadow.
She thought she would feel a hint of cold, or perhaps that something would suck her in or chew on her fingers.
But there was nothing.
Nothing.
First, up to a joint. Then, a whole finger. Finally, her whole hand.
The shadow still moves, but aside from the change in the light, nothing happens at all.
Exactly as Typhon said.
It's just a shadow.

The tree's roots begin to emerge as it gradually lifts off the ground.
A thunderous sound rings through the forest and suppresses the shouts of everyone underneath.
Surrounded by other trees, it slowly rises into the air as its roots wring together into a bundle and form an unprecedented—in human terms—mobile structure.
Its leaves come falling down from the canopy, but the Sami are not shocked in the slightest. Instead, they appear very excited.
Indeed, what could be more encouraging than your tribe's ancestral tree lifting itself from the ground along with all the clan's history and memories?

Before she leaves, Magallan snaps a picture of the enormous tree standing in the forest.
For some reason, she feels that this gigantic being almost completely blocking the sun looks kind of familiar—
She doesn't think too much about it, and merely scribbles her immediate thoughts into her notebook.
