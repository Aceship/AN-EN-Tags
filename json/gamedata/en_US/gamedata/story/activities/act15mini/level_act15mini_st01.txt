[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="r")]
[name="'Captain'"]You pity those creatures?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="r")]
[name="'Captain'"]I can understand your sympathy.
[name="'Captain'"]Let me ask you a question though, soldier.
[name="'Captain'"]As I recall, you're the son of a farmer.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="l")]
[name="'Soldier'"]Yes, Captain.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="r")]
[name="'Captain'"]Then, on your family's land, you must breed burdenbeasts. You use them to pull your carts, and otherwise create value as your father demands.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="r")]
[name="'Captain'"]Do you think those burdenbeasts would have done any of that on their own, without your father to tame them?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="l")]
[name="'Soldier'"]Of course not, Captain.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="r")]
[name="'Captain'"]So what makes you think the Sami would?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="l")]
[name="'Soldier'"]But, Captain—
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="r")]
[name="'Captain'"]After the Ursus people overthrew the Hippogryph's rule, they spent a millennium transforming the land into what Ursus needed it to be.
[name="'Captain'"]And yet Sami remains a desolate woodland.
[name="'Captain'"]The Sami have contributed nothing to civilization.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="l")]
[name="'Soldier'"]...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="r")]
[name="'Captain'"]I believe that with proper guidance, they will eventually come to understand the painstaking efforts Ursus has made here.
[name="'Captain'"]We've brought them the fire of civilization, so they should be shedding tears of gratitude.
[name="'Captain'"]Yet their response, well, I believe it goes without saying.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="l")]
[name="'Soldier'"]Yes, Captain.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_082", bstart=0.2,bend=0.7, focus="r")]
[name="'Captain'"]They understand only strength, and more civilized means of persuasion fall on deaf ears.
[name="'Captain'"]As such, violence is a necessary evil.
[name="'Captain'"]But when their descendants are living in sturdy homes and enjoying the products of Ursus culture...
[name="'Captain'"]—Then they'll understand.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_080", focus="r")]

[name="Ivan"]By the way, are you particularly familiar with Sami?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Magallan"]Well, I've never used this route before, so not really.
[name="Magallan"]But I've heard it takes just as many supplies to get through Sami as it does to enter the icefield, and there are fewer outposts there as you get nearer to the icefield, so restocking is difficult too.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_080", focus="r")]
[name="Ivan"]Indeed, it is a savage place.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Magallan"]You don't seem to like it much, Mr. Ivan.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_080", focus="r")]
[name="Ivan"]Normally, there is a permanent garrison at every outpost on the Ursus border, but the Sami-Ursus border only has regular patrols. Can you guess why?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#10$1", focus="l")]
[name="Magallan"]Does... Ursus have some sort of dispute with Sami?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_080", focus="r")]
[name="Ivan"]Dispute? The Sami invaded Ursus territory and attacked our soldiers, all to satisfy their malicious, primitive desires.
[name="Ivan"]Even the sentry outpost up ahead was once occupied by the Sami for no reason at all. We even so kindly helped them repel the demons before issuing a protest to reclaim our territory.
[name="Ivan"]But they refused to leave, and even harmed our soldiers. In the end we had no choice but to drive them out with force.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Magallan"]Is that so...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#10$1", focus="l")]
[name="Magallan"](Is that so...?)
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_080", focus="r")]
[name="Ivan"]The barbarous Sami exacted their revenge by sending out a vengeful spirit we call the Witch.
[name="Ivan"]She killed every last soldier at the outpost, and has been wandering the border ever since.
[name="Ivan"]Whenever she runs across a small squad, she'll engulf them in a snowstorm before going in for the kill, but if she meets a larger force she'll hide in the wind and snow.
[name="Ivan"]We can neither get rid of her nor chase her away. A real thorn in our side.
[name="Ivan"]In the end, our only option is to strengthen the border defenses with an elite patrol squad, simply to prevent the Sami from wreaking further havoc.
[name="Ivan"]You must also be careful when passing through Sami.
[name="Ivan"]The moment they spot an outsider, they will not stop until they rip out your throat to sip on your blood.
[name="Ivan"]Like the wild beasts swarming the snowfield, we can only keep them in check by force.
[name="Ivan"]Am I clear?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#10$1", focus="l")]
[name="Magallan"]Y-Yeah, you're clear.

A gust of wind kicks up waves of snow, pouring towards the outpost.
However, the waves seem to advance only sluggishly, at a controlled speed. As if commanded to do so.
This is not an optical illusion caused by the distance, but the wind and snow are indeed following orders.
They dare not let even a snowflake overtake their leader without permission.
And she, currently leading the wind's charge, holds her scepter high as she slowly makes her way towards the outpost.
One step, then another.
Smooth, steady, unquestionable.
Until the land is buried beneath the wind and snow.
Or so it might have gone. But Magallan welcomes this scene, more than anyone else on the northern frontier.
Because the woman walking amongst the ice and snow is her best friend on the icefield.

[name="Santalla"]Yes?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Magallan"]There's something... I need to apologize to you for. I hope you won't get angry.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Santalla"]I won't know until I hear it.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name='Magallan']Erm, so earlier, at the sentry outpost, I got a little excited and took some samples from Mr. Tree.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#7$1", focus="r")]
[name='Santalla']Did you harm the old tree?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name='Magallan']N-No, the thing is, I did intend to make a hole to collect a sample, but as soon as I touched it, it just dropped two pieces of bark.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name='Magallan']So really, I didn't—
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#7$1", focus="r")]
[name='Santalla']Bark?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name='Magallan']Yeah, please don't get mad. I didn't doodle on it or anything.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#11$1", focus="r")]
[name='Santalla']May I... see them?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#4$1", focus="l")]
[name='Magallan']Eh? O-Okay.

[name='Santalla']Yes, praise be the old tree.
[name='Santalla']The snowstorm will be here soon, so we need to hurry and find somewhere suitable to spend the night.
[name='Santalla']Let's go.
