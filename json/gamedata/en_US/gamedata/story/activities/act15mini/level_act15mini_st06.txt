[name="Ursus Caravan Guard"]Like, say you think it's a completely windless night, but something still gets blown over. They'd call that the souls of the dead passing by.
[name="Ursus Caravan Guard"]Not stupid, if you ask me.

The dark swamp surges up, and the disaster merges into solid entities that leap towards Typhon from the black waves.
For over a decade, she has seen the same dream again and again. A pitch-black dream.
The Sami say that while asleep, people can free themselves from the shackles of their corporeal forms and meet both the living and the dead.
Typhon has always known that if she could strip away the darkness covering her eyes, she could turn back and take one last look at her mother and father–
Yet, she has never seen anything.
Because a hunter only keeps her eyes on her prey.

A branch pierced the top of his head, and the blood flowing down over his body froze into a sculpture of crimson ice. But the warrior neither moved nor blinked.
Ten days and nights later, the fierce beast retreated, and he awoke from his fever only to find himself lying in the snow, and the wound atop his head fused with a tree branch.
