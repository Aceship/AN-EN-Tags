[name="Magallan"]Huh. The guy waving the sign around looks a bit familiar... Was he the one who performed in front of a restaurant near Rhine HQ?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#8$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Oh right, being right next door to a fast food joint was the Caravan International Travel Agency's selling point.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#10$1")]
[name="Magallan"]But he was flipping that sign around way too fast for me to see what was on it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#9$1")]
[name="Typhon"]Hot springs.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#4$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Oh... Uh, have you been there before?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#9$1")]
[name="Typhon"]Nope, but I've seen more than enough outlanders shivering from the cold and asking where the hot springs are. That must be why they come here.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#8$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Heh, I'm actually pretty interested in those myself.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]When you're blessed by the Samivilinn, it's not so difficult to find a hot spring in the forest.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]While I haven't been to southern Sami in years, I've also heard that the locals often encounter anxious southerners on the road.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]They'll offer handfuls of unfashioned gold bars in exchange for divining the location of nearby hot springs.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]And do they get an answer?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Hah. Who knows?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]What I do know is that some people mistakenly believe that—because of the southerners' apparent fondness for such ugly ingots—they must never have developed any sense of aesthetics.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Then I guess... they never reached a mutual understanding.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#9$1")]
[name="Typhon"]However, they did end up finding experienced people like yourself, and eventually discovered the hot springs on their own.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#9$1")]
[name="Typhon"]Take a look at that. The thing that's always singing.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#4$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Oh, an advertising truck.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#9$1")]
[name="Typhon"]That's right. If you follow it all the way, you'll find another hot spring that they're developing.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#9$1")]
[name="Typhon"]This sort of thing happens often.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]You're quite knowledgeable about this little town.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#7$1")]
[name="Typhon"]Of course. It's Sami soil.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#7$1")]
[name="Typhon"]Even without many strange occurrences people need my help with, it's not like I can't figure out what's happening.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Hmm... This place feels pretty different from the rest of Sami, though.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Where did I put my visitor's brochure again... Oh, found it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]According to the map, everything from here to here is nothing but resorts for the tourists. There are hardly any Sami homes.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#2$1")]
[name="Magallan"]The neighborhoods we've been walking through not only have electricity, good signal strength, and even intercity net, but... (*takes a deep breath*) Yeah, I smell water purifiers, too.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Considering this is where a lot of major tech company offices are concentrated, it makes sense that they'd want convenient communications...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]But the insides of the offices don't look much different from the ones at Rhine HQ.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Also, they're using steel beams and concrete to simulate the appearance of large trees, and putting their buildings on top of them. Isn't that offensive to the Sami?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#6$1")]
[name="Typhon"]Probably not?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#9$1")]
[name="Typhon"]I can see why they do, though; your people are terrified of Sami, so they lock themselves in metal cages for protection.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Can't argue with that... Even for researchers like me who've gone into the icefield quite a few times, there's no way we can match how freely you can move around out there.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#9$1")]
[name="Typhon"]Don't worry. Even so, you are still connected to the land of Sami.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2012_typhon_1#9$1")]
[name="Typhon"]That's what Arges always said.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#13$1")]
[name="Santalla"]...Magallan, do you mind if I take a look at that brochure of yours?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Go ahead, but I got it when I was entering the endless icefield from Ursus, so all the labels are in Ursine. What did you want to see? Maybe I can help you find it!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Oh, that's the wrong side. That's just an ad for an Ursus nursing home with a Sami resort.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]It's fine, Magallan. I can read it myself.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Here they are... The coordinates from the transmission.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#1$1")]
[name="Santalla"]...Excuse me, I have some business to take care of. Typhon, Magallan, I'm afraid we'll have to say goodbye for now.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#8$1")]
[name="Magallan"]Ehehe. Next time, I'll be setting off for the endless icefield from here, so I'm sure we'll meet again, Simone!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#8$1")]
[name="Magallan"]If we run into any snowstorms though, please come back to save us!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#12$1")]
[name="Santalla"]Haha, will do.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_341_sntlla_1#3$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_529_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#2$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#7$1")]
[name="Magallan"]For example, stay far away from black snow, and if you're hearing things, don't answer.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#7$1")]
[name="Magallan"]And... near the endless icefield, on the Fjal Vetrtonn, there's a high wall made up of many fortresses filled with warriors.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#7$1")]
[name="Magallan"]I'm sure they're nice people, but it's best to keep your distance!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_529_1#1$1")]
[name="Rhine Lab Researcher"]A high wall? Can Sami technology compete with Victoria's city defense artillery?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_248_mgllan_1#1$1")]
[name="Magallan"]No, the people here aren't too different from how they're depicted in the explorer's guidebook published by Ursus last century.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_529_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_529_1#1$1")]
