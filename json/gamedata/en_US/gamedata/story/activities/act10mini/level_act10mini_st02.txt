Sharp pain.
The sharp, prickling pain of this Oripathy lesion hasn't stopped hurting for the past three months.
Maybe it's time to leave this place.

No, when the time comes to wave goodbye to this world, it must be done elegantly and in perfect solitudeâ€”

Stricken with pain and disease, the Feline girl looks up at the sky through the windows of the abandoned house.
A heavy fog shrouds the entire city of Caladon, to the point that the sun's radiance can no longer be seen.
From the Grey Hills to Toron, then Castshire and finally to Caladon.
I kept running, wandering the world without aim. My friends all died one by one.
And the further I got, the more I lost.

The abandoned district on the edge of Caladon. It's the quietest part of the city.
Ever since a natural disaster swept across Caladon a few years ago, this district, having fallen into disrepair, was moved to the edge of the city.
The crumbling buildings, the collapsed foundations. All of it bore witness to Caladon's history.
Gazing out from the top of the abandoned towers, there is but a vast, endless wasteland in the distance.

The Feline witch sits against a wall in a corner and gently closes her eyes.
The sharp pain of the Oripathy lesion is starting to fade, and her body feels heavier and heavier by the moment.
Her memories flash quickly by, as though playing back before her eyes.
All her witch friends, the gentle Great Witch Grant, and the night the Victorian soldiers burned the Witch Forest by their cannon fire.
The times she spent drifting in the wastelands and the cities, the days she had to steal to get by, and all the unfair treatment she has suffered.
None of it matters anymore.

[character]
The young Feline looks hesitantly at the window. Her face is shrouded in helplessness. Time drifts slowly by in the pitch dark of this abandoned tower.
She spends a brief moment pondering in silence, before finally letting out a long sigh and freeing an exhausted smile. It seems the weight on her shoulders is gone.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#2$1")]
[name="Susie"]You're right.
[character(name="avg_141_nights_1#1$1")]
[name="Haze"]Now, if you still feel down in the dumps, just cry it all out. Nobody's around to judge you.

The girl on her back grows weaker and weaker by the minute.
She can feel a vibrant life slowly fading away.
A wet, yet warm feeling gushes onto her back and gradually spreads all over.

[name="Susie"]This... What is this...?
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#4$1")]
[name="Susie"]Is it... blood?
Dark red blood spills from the girl's mouth and nose, dripping onto the ground.
Susie knows what this means. All Infected do.

[character]
Ever since she left home five years ago, she's witnessed the passing of many Infected.
With each death she's seen, she's grown increasingly numb to them.
This is the fate that awaits all Infected.
But, for some reason, she finds herself unwilling to bear the pain of this life disappearing before her.

She sets the girl down to ease her pain.
She tightly grasps Haze's hand and tries her best to wipe away the blood on her face.
Hopeless though it may be, she tries her hardest to stall the coming of death.
Yet death draws ever nearer. It all seems to come to such a meaningless head.

Her low cries pierce through the empty night sky, echoing throughout the empty, abandoned streets.
Just then, she hears someone walking slowly towards them.
