Ancient Ruined Tower, Bleached Wasteland
Ruined buildings stand tall between the steep canyon walls, their purpose now unknown.
Those who live in the shadows of these ruins have brought life back to this barren land.

A massive machine sits at the center of the abandoned warehouse, and industrial noises fill the air.

[Character(name="avg_npc_327_1#1$1")]

[name="Guard"]Looking forward to it.

[name="Engineer Andrey"]It's not like you could fly this with a standard driving license, though. What about pilots?

[name="Engineer Andrey"]It needs two of them, and not many have the required skills, even in Columbia.
[Character(name="avg_npc_327_1#1$1")]
[name="Guard"]Nine was concerned about that too, but Dijkstra said he had an idea.
[character(name="avg_npc_006")]
[name="Engineer Andrey"]Either way, we've got more pressing issues right now.
[character(name="avg_npc_006")]
[name="Engineer Andrey"]We need a whole new control system, and that's not something I can whip up for you. You'll have to find one.
[character(name="avg_npc_006")]
[name="Engineer Andrey"]Not just any old thing will do, either. It needs to be something on the scale of a mining platform control system.
[character(name="avg_npc_006")]
[name="Engineer Andrey"]We'll also need to replace the insulation plates for the Originium engine.
[character(name="avg_npc_006")]

[name="Engineer Andrey"]Well, you're the boss.

About fifteen minutes later, the convoy passes through a canyon.
Ballista turrets and Originium cannons are on full alert, sweeping the surroundings for potential threats.
Driven by powerful engines, the heavily armored vehicles dash across the rugged landscape.
It is a loadout intended to take them safely across the Terran wasteland to their destination.
But there are very few guarantees in the wastes.
[PlaySound(key="$b_char_rockexplo", volume=0.7)]
A boulder suddenly stands up from the ground, reaching eight meters in height, dirt falling off it like a waterfall.
[playsound(key="$smallearthquake", volume=0.6)]
[CameraShake(duration=3, xstrength=4, ystrength=4, vibrato=20, randomness=30, fadeout=true)]
It is a Metal Crab, camouflaged as a rock.
The creature charges at the convoy.
[PlaySound(key="$d_avg_warfireamb_loop", volume=0.6, loop=true, channel="bgs")]
The cannons unload onto the beast, while the ballistae aim for its joints.
However, their efforts prove futile at slowing it down.
The Metal Crab smashes into the side of the large truck at full speed.
The armored vehicle topples over violently, crushing one of its escorts.
War cries and the sounds of clanging metal echo through the canyon.
Hundreds of strangely dressed warriors charge out from the shadows, from behind rocks or cracks in the canyon walls.
They throw explosives made from Originium crystals at the convoy, and fire at stragglers using improvised ballistae.
It is a scene of chaos, as the convoy's guards try to flee for their lives.
The outcome of the battle is never once in doubt.
