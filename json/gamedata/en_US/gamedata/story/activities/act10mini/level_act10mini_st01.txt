Nine in the evening is when the Infected factory nearby changes shifts.
Many of the workmen choose to kill time by paying Miss Quercus's shop a visit.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#2$1")]
There is not much the shop has to offer to its patrons.
A crude fried fin cutlet, a bowl of tasteless potato soup, and a mug of fruit-wine-flavored water.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#10$1")]
And yet, the shop has garnered a few regulars.

[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#1$1")]
Caladon's Infected community is home to many a peculiar man, and Bitter Root counts among them.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#2$1")]
Mr. Root works for an organization called Rhodes Island. He's a 'professional' hired by the lords of the city council.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#12$1")]
But the way Rhodes Island treats the Infected boggles the mind.
'Rhodes Island will assist the Caladon City Council and provide medical assistance to all Infected,' said their public address.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#5$1")]
Why would anyone willingly help the Infected... especially when they're not even from here?
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="James the Worker"] How's work today, Bitt? T'ain't often you get the free time to come for a drink.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Bitter Root"] It's fine. We hired a few extra pair of hands. Things calmed down quite a bit, thanks to them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="James the Worker"] Eh? Is it that good working for Rhodes Island? Do they pay well?
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Bitter Root"] What of it? You interested?
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="James the Worker"] Nah, forget I said anything. I can't even read... I'd just be making a fool of myself.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#5$1")]
At first, no one in the Infected community trusted them. There were even rumors that they were here to take the late-stage Infected away for experiments.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#2$1")]
But Rhodes Island proved themselves with their actions. They really are here to help.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#1$1")]
Be it a regular Oripathy infection checkup, acute Oripathy attack treatment, or even just a normal workplace injury, you just walk into their clinic, and they'll help you.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#3$1")]
Even right here, right now, there are those who have doubts about Rhodes Island's true motives. But at the very least, all of the pub's regulars trust them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_005", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Bitter Root"] By the way, Jim, I saw your wife on my way here.

[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#10$1")]
[name="Susie"] Be safe on your way home, Mr. James.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#1$1")]
Unlike most of the people in the establishment, Mr. James is not Infected.
In Caladon, it isn't uncommon to find non-Infected working in the Infected community.
Ever since the 'New Caladon Infected Act' came into place, a lot of the unemployed poor have been risking themselves working in the Infected factories.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#5$1")]
A great majority of them leave the Infected community as soon as they get off work. They also avoid coming into direct contact with the Infected during working hours.
That's understandable. All of us Infected have gotten used to the attitude, and no one blames the non-Infected workmen for it.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#3$1")]
Though, still, there are people like Mr. James.

[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=1)]

[name="Stone the Infected"] Peh, and here I thought it was something that actually mattered.
[name="Stone the Infected"] You're naive, you know? I gave up on that hokum long ago.

[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=1)]
[name="Bean the Infected"] One second. Let's see... I remember some bits and pieces of it back when they announced it.
[name="Bean the Infected"] Oh, take a look. It says here that Infected workers cannot work more than fifteen hours a day, that the factories have to give the Infected the same kinds of Originium protective equipment as non-Infected...
[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=2)]
[name="Stone the Infected"] Pfft. Don't make me laugh.
[name="Stone the Infected"] There's a snowball's chance that's true. What's that saying again? There's no pies in the sky?
[name="Stone the Infected"] What would you outlanders even know? Me, I'm a born-and-bred Caladonian. I've seen how they do things my whole life. No one knows the nobles how I do.
[name="Stone the Infected"] You're still counting on those stingy tosspots to do anything for you out of their pockets? Dream on.
[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=1)]
[name="Bean the Infected"] *Sigh*... You want to at least hold out some hope... Keep a positive outlook on things.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Bitter Root"] There's no need to be so negative. Who could've thought ten years ago that they'd pass that New Caladonian Infected Act, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=2)]
[name="Stone the Infected"] Now that, that's apples to oranges.
[name="Stone the Infected"] Us Infected can work their factories, and the heads only have to pay us half the money. They get to pocket the other half! Of course they passed that bill!
[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=1)]
[name="Bean the Infected"] That's true. Oftentimes, they don't even pay us with cash, just Wage Tickets.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Bitter Root"] Things take time. I think you could be more optimistic about this.
[name="Bitter Root"] Keep in mind that Caladon willingly accepts Infected from all the cities out there, and even offers work. You don't see that anywhere else in Victoria.
[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=1)]
[name="Bean the Infected"] I heard from some of the foremen these policies are... what... 'Columbian-style?'
[name="Bean the Infected"] Are all the Columbian cities like this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Bitter Root"] Well... It's complicated. There's a tiny bit of difference.
[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=2)]
[name="Stone the Infected"] Whatever, time for a new topic. Any other news?
[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=1)]
[name="Bean the Infected"] Let's see...
[name="Bean the Infected"] 'Terror in Caladon! Loud Roars Heard Underground at Night!'
[name="Bean the Infected"] And then... 'Possible Infected Smuggling Activity Spotted in Abandoned Districts in Caladon Outskirts.'
[name="Bean the Infected"] Then there's also this... 'Public Safety in Jeopardy, Convicts and Wanted Criminals Have Infiltrated the Infected Community.'
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#7$1")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_329_1$1", name2="avg_npc_002",focus=2)]
[name="Stone the Infected"] That's the 'Caladon Daily' and their rubbish reporting for you. They love their terrorizing headlines, and they take care to add the word 'Infected' in there. Just talking about those hack journos makes me want to puke.

My dream—
To the Infected, dreams are distant and unattainable.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#12$1")]
My dream has always been to have my own shop, my own life.
So I wouldn't have to be a burden on my family anymore.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#3$1")]
And now, my dream is about to come true. It's an unimaginable luxury for an Infected.
Does that make me lucky?

The girl is unwilling to believe what she sees before her. She wants to close her eyes.

This has to be a dream.
This has to be a bad dream.
Right. The moment she opens her eyes, she'll be free of this nightmare.
Yes, when she open her eyes, she'll be greeted by the same old ceiling. A new day awaits her. A new day with her own shop.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#1$1")]
But the shop before her is nothing but a pile of rubble engulfed in flames.
Of the sign that once read 'Green Spark,' nothing remains but a few burnt fragments. It matches the walls and ceiling, long since rendered ash.
Before her eyes lies what was once her dreams, her hopes, and her future.
All of it now buried in this burning rubble.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#5$1")]
[name="Susie"] Why...?
The will that once helped the Feline girl through countless tribulations can support her small body no longer.
[character(name="avg_377_gdglow_1#6$1")]
She falls to her knees.
