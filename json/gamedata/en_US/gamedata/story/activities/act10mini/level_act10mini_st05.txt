[name="Calm Wastelander"] Security in Caladon has been tight as of late, Quercus. We couldn't go inside to find you.
[name="Calm Wastelander"] I know it wouldn't have helped. The disease we have is incurable, and it was her time to go.
[name="Calm Wastelander"] It's just... the way she cried those last couple of days. It was hard to watch.
[name="Calm Wastelander"] *Sigh*... You've sent so many of us on our way. You know how much it hurts.
[name="Calm Wastelander"] She begged me to put her out of her misery with my Arts, but I couldn't do it.
[name="Calm Wastelander"] Then... the next day, we found her at the bottom of the hill. She was asleep. Her eyes were closed. She didn't have to cry again.
[name="Calm Wastelander"] There wasn't anyone there. She didn't infect anyone, and she didn't bother any of us. Everything was fine. It was all good. I just thought it was...

[character(name="avg_492_quercu_1#8$1",focus=-1)]
[name="Calm Wastelander"] Why are you helping us? The medicine's not cheap, right?
[name="Calm Wastelander"] You often come to us wastelanders for information. Who do you work for?
[name="Calm Wastelander"] We're just curious, we've known you so long... They say you probably used to be an officer in the military...
[name="Calm Wastelander"] Honestly, it doesn't much matter to us who you really are. We don't care for the righteousness of the city folks. You're helping us live longer, so we'll help you out, whatever it is you're doing.
[character(name="avg_492_quercu_1#9$1")]

The walls crack, and the rocking intensifies.
Immediately after, the explosion gives way to the rumble of the tunnel's collapse. Together with the tremors, the unbroken sounds of structures bursting draw closer and closer.

[character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#7$1")]

[name="Councilor Angst"] Speaking of which, how did everything shake out in the end?
[character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#6$1")]
[name="Skyfire"] The City Council passed your proposal, even if you only gained a single supporter.
[character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#6$1",focus=-1)]
[name="Councilor Angst"] That's worth celebrating, Miss Mountbelan.
[character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#8$1")]
[name="Skyfire"] Is it really, Professor?
[character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#7$1")]
[name="Skyfire"] There's still old nobility against the Infected community, and they've all ganged up in private. The clashing's only going to worsen from now on.
[name="Skyfire"] Now they're just waiting for Duke Gododdin to come back. They've signed a joint letter asking the Duke to abolish your title and strip you of your noble status.
[name="Skyfire"] It's VERY stacked against you.
[character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#7$1",focus=-1)]
[name="Councilor Angst"] Hahahaha...
[name="Councilor Angst"] I'm already a good 153 years old, Miss Mountbelan.
[name="Councilor Angst"] I'm looking to retire next year, retreat to my little castle, and take up a bit of my studies.
[name="Councilor Angst"] Titles, status, authority.
[name="Councilor Angst"] Do you think any of that still concerns me?
[name="Councilor Angst"] If things proceed without much hiccup, you'll be back at Rhodes Island too, won't you? Send Dame Kal'tsit my regards.
[character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#6$1")]
[name="Skyfire"] I will...
[name="Skyfire"] I'm just worried for you somewhat, Professor.
[character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#6$1",focus=-1)]
[name="Councilor Angst"] Now, now, what's to worry for? Look at my rickety old body.
[name="Councilor Angst"] I tell you, some things people go and say are all but pompous and, well, completely meaningless excuses.
[name="Councilor Angst"] People are already too accustomed to lying with pretentious jargon. So the lies pile up, and as lofty as it was meant to be, the principle gets washed out in the process.
[name="Councilor Angst"] Miss Mountbelan, do you know why I pushed for that proposal for Caladon so?
[character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#8$1")]
[name="Skyfire"] You mean, the reason all that pretention sticks around?
[character(name="avg_166_skfire_1#8$1",focus=-1)]
[name="Councilor Angst"] Twenty years ago, a scientist named Janet Longfellow published an essay.
[name="Councilor Angst"] She set forth this view: if we don't streamline and improve on our current Originium industry and its waste products, then the year-on-year buildup of industrial waste may bring about frightening consequences.
[name="Councilor Angst"] At the time, Victoria's academic circles all turned their noses up at that, and the nobles wielded public opinion to unabashedly ridicule this fine scientist. In her anger, she left Victoria altogether.
[name="Councilor Angst"] But in the last ten years, the amount of Infected in Victoria has accelerated at a worrying rate.
[name="Councilor Angst"] Times have changed, Miss Mountbelan. We have to face the issues that 'Oripathy' and the 'Infected' bring. Maintaining this status quo will only worsen things.
[name="Councilor Angst"] 153 years, Miss Mountbelan. It's not common to see people live as long as I do, even among Savra.
[name="Councilor Angst"] But a long life's a good thing. It gives you the chance to see firsthand the folds and changes of history, to learn from your mistakes.
[name="Councilor Angst"] In my century and a half, I've witnessed the toppling of Gaul's majestic palace, the fall of Iberia's golden city.
[name="Councilor Angst"] In the plains of Columbia, I saw for myself the destruction the Grand Duke's army wrought on the frontier territories. I saw the Columbians in their sharp, steep ascent over the wastes.
[name="Councilor Angst"] If Victoria can't change, then in the end, it'll only be another Gaul.
[name="Councilor Angst"] It's just as I've told you, Miss Mountbelan.
[name="Councilor Angst"] Times have changed.
