The imposing black-suit pulls the ring on an incendiary meant for military use, and tosses it into the depths of the pitch-black room.
However—
The moment the flare lights up is the moment they finally realize just how stupid a decision they've made.
Within the cramped, dilapidated room sits a great pile of Originium explosives and hazardous chemicals.
The bucket they knocked over earlier was filled with high-concentration raw keton, now spilled all across the floor.

The collapsible military pike shoots forth like lightning, smashing apart at least ten centimeters' worth of concrete wall and tearing through the structure.

The sound of an explosion as grand as thunder rolls across the entirety of Caladon.
Harsh firelight follows a mushroom cloud straight into the skies, shining over the abandoned plate, through the Gododdin night, and across the southwest harbors of Victoria.

In the wake of the cabin's explosion, the surrounding ground caves in entirely, crashing down to the city plate's structural layer.
And that layer being in deep disrepair, it continues its collapse, dropping down and down, letting out an unending rumbling roar.
Where the cabin once stood now resembles a direct strike from a high-speed battleship bombardment. Only a massive pit filled with thick smoke remains to tell the tale.
The suspects, the evidence, and the truth are all blown away into the black smog along with the abandoned building, trailing high and away with the wind.

Blown head over heels by the shockwave, the Victorian Mounted Officer now stares in bewilderment at the entire sight before her. Nothing that just happened has processed for her yet.
November 28th, 1097.
Nighttime in Caladon City finds itself exceptionally lively.
