[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_194_leto_1#8$1",focus="r")]
[name="Leto"]Whatever. I didn't get to this part, did I?
[name="Leto"]You could call me half Kjerag, even if I don't really feel like one at all. I grew up in Ursus with my mamochka.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Harold"]Oh, so your mother is Ursine?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_194_leto_1#8$1",focus="r")]
[name="Leto"]Yep, but she told me I was born in Kjerag, and my papa is from here...
[name="Leto"]I don't remember much about anything that happened when I was a kid. I guess you could call this a vacation.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Harold"]Hmm, I see.
[name="Harold"]By the way, I've been meaning to ask since we met...
[name="Harold"]What is that box you are holding, Rosalind?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_194_leto_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Leto"]Oh, this...?

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Harold"]Forgive me. If that intrudes upon your privacy in any way, you need not answer.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_194_leto_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Leto"]It's okay. It's not really a secret or anything. I'm just figuring out how to explain it...
[name="Leto"]It's something that... my mamochka left to me.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4114_harold_1#16$1",focus="l")]
[name="Harold"]My...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4114_harold_1#12$1",focus="l")]
[name="Harold"]Please accept my condolences.
[name="Harold"]I am sorry to raise such a painful topic, Rosalind.
[name="Harold"]Truly sorry.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_194_leto_1#8$1",focus="r")]
[name="Leto"]Hmph, what's so painful about this?
[name="Leto"]I'm here to fulfill Mamochka's wishes.
