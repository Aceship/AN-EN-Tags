It was more than twenty years ago.
I remember that winter was so much colder than in previous years. The snow never stopped, and the wind was almost strong enough to blow you away.
The weather was so bad no one would willingly go outdoors.
Everyone stayed inside with their furnaces lit from day to night. There was always tea heating atop the stove for convenient pick-me-ups.
The burdenbeast sheds were specially reinforced before winter came, and the beasts huddled together, hibernating in groups.
Time seemed to slow down in Kjerag that year. Every passing day felt like a slog to go through, and yet the subsequent days would bring the same wind and snow.
I was still young then, and I just couldn't bear to live that way anymore. I snuck out with a few men in tow that day, with a plan to hunt in the mountains.
But the snow overwhelmed us, and there wasn't a single target to be found. I got separated from the others halfway, and could only continue ascending the mountain with all the effort I could barely muster.
And then, it was here...
I met Tatyana on this very spot.

As if responding to Arctosz's words, a snowball falls from a tree branch up high and hits his head.

Arctosz raises his head.
The snow and wind gradually subside, and bright rays pierce through the entwined branches of the trees before him, casting fragmented shadows on his face.
A vaguely female figure seems to pop up from a patch of soft snow.
Snowflakes scatter all around as she moves. The young Tatyana smiles as she looks down to meet the young man's gaze below.
Arctosz suddenly feels his eyes go dry.
The snowy white he is so used to is suddenly so dazzling.

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]But that was no easy feat in Kjerag, back then.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]But why?
[name="Leto"]If you liked each other, then just stay together. It can't get any simpler than that, right?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]Yes... it should have been the simplest thing to do.
[name="Arctosz"]But Rosalind, you don't understand Kjerag, or at least the way Kjerag was two decades ago.
[name="Arctosz"]We were still secluding ourselves in our little corner of the land, and basically had no contact with outsiders.
[name="Arctosz"]You don't get Catastrophes in Kjerag, and everyone thought it was thanks to Kjeragandr protecting Her people. We believed the place was sacred, unlike the outside world, where Catastrophes are commonplace.
[name="Arctosz"]I've always believed Kjerag back then was quiet and peaceful.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]But the way things are now, I have to admit, we were closed-off, and... blind.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]Our lives were just farming, herding, and praying to Kjeragandr.
[name="Arctosz"]Outsiders were rare to see, and we weren't exactly friendly to them either.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#13$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]......
[name="Leto"]So Mamochka...
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]You know her best, I'm sure.
[name="Arctosz"]Tatyana was so passionate, frank, ostentatious, and didn't bother to fit in.
[name="Arctosz"]She captivated me completely.
[name="Arctosz"]But at the same time, she was too strange and too different for Kjerag then...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#12$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]Hmph.
[name="Leto"]So? Are you trying to tell me you held back because of that? You didn't dare to marry a foreigner?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]Wait, where'd I come into the picture then? You had me without marrying her?!
[name="Leto"]I'm serious, beardy. You better not be joking.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#12$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]Rosalind, wait! Don't be hasty... it's not what you think!
[name="Arctosz"]It didn't happen like that! Easy now!
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]Then what happened?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#14$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]I *cough*, *cough* of course I married your mother!
[name="Arctosz"]Many objected to it, but it ultimately wasn't an impossible task. After all, the head of Clan Silverash married a foreigner too.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]My marriage would have been an embarrassment for the Paleroche clan, but I still managed to convince my father, our patriarch at the time, to go through with it.
[name="Arctosz"]You met him already, Rosalind. It was him who brought you back home yesterday, even though I was so drunk I didn't recognize you at all.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#13$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]You mean... That old man...?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#14$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]Is my grandfather?!
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#13$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]Yes.
[name="Arctosz"]I appreciate that he ultimately let us marry, and kept it a secret from the others too.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#14$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]One of my biggest regrets is not inviting more guests to our wedding.
[name="Arctosz"]But Tatyana told me it was fine, that she didn't care about the formalities as long as we loved each other. Nothing else mattered, as long as we could be together for good.
[name="Arctosz"]And then, we had you.
[name="Arctosz"]The days I spent together with you two were the best I could have ever imagined.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]......
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]But our good times didn't last long. The Silverash couple got into an accident soon after you were born.
[name="Arctosz"]Kjerag was already in a state of turmoil due to the Silverash reforms, and there were many who regarded them as a thorn in their side.
[name="Arctosz"]Most didn't dare to challenge the Tri-Clan Leaders directly, but attacking a foreigner in private was much easier to do.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]They said it was an accident, but truth be told... it was far from that simple.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]I don't know much about it, but I remember the Doctor telling me that the Paleroches are conservative.
[name="Leto"]So Clan Paleroche must have been against the reforms too.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#14$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]...Yes.
[name="Arctosz"]I'm not trying to lecture you now, Rosalind, but there are some things you have a right to know.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]It was beneficial for the Paleroches to suppress the Silverashes then, and I alone could not have changed our decision to do so.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#12$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]So... we Paleroches are the most devout believers and guardians of Kjeragandr, while the Browntails are the astute followers who make sensible decisions.
[name="Arctosz"]While the Silverashes had gone astray and tried to destroy our faith in vain, putting Kjerag in danger.
[name="Arctosz"]This was how our three clans were seen back then, and also the way the situation really was in Kjerag.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#14$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]And I, as the next head of the Paleroche clan, could not harm the family's interests.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#14$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]There was not much I could do.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#13$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]And so you abandoned me and Mamochka.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#12$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]I did not!
[name="Arctosz"]I never abandoned you, and there's no way I would've abandoned Tatyana!
[name="Arctosz"]But those people, would they be satisfied with a mere 'accident'?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#13$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]The Silverashes were dead, and I... married an Ursine woman.
[name="Arctosz"]They didn't know how great Tatyana was, and didn't care for her affection towards Kjerag.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#14$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]She was just an Ursine woman in the eyes of many, an outsider representing Kjerag's doom.
[name="Arctosz"]Rosalind, I am a warrior. I've shed so much blood, and have never feared anything.
[name="Arctosz"]But back then, all I had were sleepless nights.
[name="Arctosz"]Because I finally came to know fear.
[name="Arctosz"]I was afraid...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#13$1",focus="l")]

[name="Leto"]............
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#14$1",focus="r")]
[name="Arctosz"]The best choice I could make at the time was to have you leave, to go far away from Kjerag.
[name="Arctosz"]Even if we couldn't see each other again, even if I couldn't be by your side anymore.
[name="Arctosz"]For I knew the two of you could live a normal and peaceful life somewhere at least...
[name="Arctosz"]Instead of running into any strange accidents somewhere I couldn't see—or even right under my nose.
[name="Arctosz"]So I wouldn't be left with just an 'accident'...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_194_leto_1#13$1",focus="l")]
[name="Leto"]...You...
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_254_1#2$1",focus="r")]

[name="Arctosz"]No, that's not what I...!
[name="Leto"]I don't care what you meant!
[name="Leto"]It sounds so neat, convincing your family to let you marry, being forced to make us leave.
[name="Leto"]Hah. You think I'm dumb?
[name="Leto"]All I can think of hearing your story is how Mamochka dealt with it all.
[name="Leto"]You left her all alone in a hostile environment for so many years, and she even raised a kid for you.
[name="Leto"]She willingly put herself in danger, even with her life on the line! But you're telling me in the end all she could do was leave??
[name="Leto"]Have you ever considered why she, an Ursine, had to endure being treated like that in your Kjerag?!
[name="Arctosz"]I...
[name="Leto"]My mamochka loved to go on adventures, she liked to try new things, she liked to explore anywhere she could. She could never stay in one place for too long.
[name="Leto"]She loved making friends, loved shopping, loved to eat all sorts of food.
[name="Leto"]Could your Kjerag from twenty years ago even satisfy any of that?
[name="Leto"]Do you care about any of those things at all?!
[name="Leto"]Why does it sound like you're the only character in your story, with nothing else?!
[name="Leto"]You said she's passionate, that she's frank, but I couldn't tell you were talking about Tatyana Yevgenyevna Larina at all!
[name="Leto"]You're happy as long as you have your wife and daughter by your side?
[name="Leto"]Hah...
[name="Leto"]I'm blown away that you actually had the guts to say that!
[name="Arctosz"]Tatyana...
[name="Arctosz"]It was me, it was my...
[name="Leto"]It's too late for tears.
[name="Leto"]Do you know what life in Ursus was like for us?
[name="Leto"]Living peaceful lives somewhere? That's enough for you?
[name="Leto"]Bullshit!
[name="Leto"]Do you know just how many people were talking behind our backs when Mamochka was raising me on her own?
[name="Leto"]You couldn't.
[name="Leto"]I grew up without a papa. Do you know how 'popular' fatherless kids are at school?
[name="Arctosz"]You were bullied?! They dared—?!
[name="Leto"]Save it.
[name="Leto"]No one dared bully me.
[name="Leto"]But listen, it had nothing to do with you. It was thanks to my fists. Even General Zima helped me more than you ever did.
[name="Leto"]Ever since I was small, I knew I had to rely on myself because I didn't have a papa. I knew I had to count on my fists to shut up those cowards who only knew how to use their mouths.
