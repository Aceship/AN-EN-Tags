[name="Bold Man"]No need to worry, last time I saw them buy some knickknacks to take home. Maybe they just came for some sightseeing.
[name="Bold Man"]Though it looks like their uniforms aren't very warm. You see? That young fellow over there's so cold his nose is running!

[name="Leto"]Me? Oh, don't mind me, you guys keep talking.
[name="Leto"]I was just curious as to why there was a big crowd blocking the way, so I had a look-see... When I heard you all talking I couldn't help but join in.
[name="Harold"]No need to apologize! You are a lady of excellent taste!
[name="Leto"]Excellent taste... You mean me? Haha, you sure can call them like you see them!
[name="Leto"]I was just looking at those coats myself! The 'I ♥ Snow' is a little kitschy, but they really are super warm!
[name="Harold"]*cough*!
[name="Seasoned Soldier"]I gotta say, Harold, you're right. The lady really does have excellent taste.
[name="Leto"]Say, dedushka, you're not just ordinary tourists, are you? What are you guys doing in Kjerag?
[name="Harold"]Dedushka? Ursine for grandfather, I believe? Fair enough, I suppose you're about the same age as my no-good daughter back home.
[name="Harold"]As for what we're here to do, haha, we're just here for sightseeing, same as you.
[name="Leto"]I'm not just here for sightseeing though.
[name="Leto"]Oh, right, do you know how to get to Platform 3?
[name="Harold"]Platform 3?
[name="Leto"]Yeah, I'm supposed to transfer there to get to Lake Silberneherze.
[name="Harold"]Hmm...
[name="Leto"]I'm guessing you don't know either then? Damn, I better go ask someone else then—
[name="Harold"]Hold!
[name="Leto"]Huh?!
[name="Harold"]If it's Platform 3 you're after... then you've come to the right man!
[name="Harold"]If you were to ask who knows best the nooks and crannies of this terminal, I, Harold Craigavon, would be your answer!
[name="Leto"]Oh, wow! Are you for real?
[name="Harold"]Entirely. I would never lie to a lady.
[name="Harold"]Since I took my first step off the train one month ago, I have found myself a captive of this bustling terminal!
[name="Harold"]I've whiled away the hours perusing every shop, to the point that I was invited to cut the ribbon for the opening of that souvenir shop there!
[name="Harold"]I dare say that the burdenbeasts here treat my fellows and I a touch bit kinder than your average tourist!
[name="Leto"]Huh... You sure about that?
[name="Leto"]I mean, look, the burdenbeast you're talking about is nibbling on that guy's clothes.

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Harold"]Correct. It happens to be announcing the arrival of the train at Platform 3.
[name="Harold"]And it seems that I, coincidentally, am headed the same way as you.

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Harold"]To put it more plainly, my destination is the statue of Kjeragandr atop Lake Silberneherze.
[name="Harold"]Not just my destination, mind you. All these upstanding young fellows as well. We're all getting on that train.
[name="Harold"]In two days' time, everyone will be gazing upon that grand statue... And that's precisely why we're here.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_194_leto_1#6$1",focus="r")]

[name="Leto"]This Kjeragandr statue they built, is it really that amazing...?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Harold"]Perhaps so! As a tourist myself, I do think it will become quite the popular attraction.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4114_harold_1#14$1",focus="l")]
[name="Harold"]Now, with that all said—I'm hoping I could have the pleasure of your company on our little tour, young lady?
