During his thorough investigation of Kjerag, the Trilby Asher has seen many locals skating on the ice underneath the warm winter sun.
He's thought that an activity like this could be somewhat enjoyable, and has wanted to try it, if he had the time.
An opportunity has unexpectedly presented itself to him.
But soon, he discovers he has made a gross misjudgment—
