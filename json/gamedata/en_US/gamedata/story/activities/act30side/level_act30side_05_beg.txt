Arctosz stops in his tracks from his father's yelling, and an ill omen stirs uncontrollably in his heart.
Perhaps it's his hangover, but a sudden headache descends on him, his stomach seems to drop to the floor, and his back feels as if something cold is creeping up on him.
Only now does Arctosz realize his father's back, which he has not seen in a long time, is slightly stooped, like a wilting tree, no longer tall and upright as he remembered.
But the dry and aged voice of the devotee continues, undeterred by Arctosz's panic.
