In my memories, I see a vast field of snow.
I remember when I was little, I sat on a wooden bed. The fireplace crackled, while a snowstorm blew outside.
The sound of the wind whispered into my ears. There was a large hand stroking my head, and there was someone putting me to bed.
And I drifted off to sleep in that warm, calming sensation.
I used to think that was Ursus.
But Mamochka told me: Nyet, Rosalind, that wasn't Ursus.
That was Kjerag wind.
That was Kjerag snow.
That... was where I was born.
