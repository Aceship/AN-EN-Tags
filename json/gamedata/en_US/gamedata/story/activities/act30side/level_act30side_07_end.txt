He pulls out a remote control from the deepest recesses of his room, constantly flicking through the various slides on a projector.
Every single one has information regarding Kjerag. Possible marching routes, the locations of military bases, the distribution of sentry posts, investigations into the Tschäggättä—
Within a week of him arriving in Kjerag, all this intelligence was already neatly organized before him, and yet again and again he forced himself to stop thinking about these matters.
To the point that he has managed to memorize most of it.
He throws aside the remote control and grabs a collapsible chair close at hand, throwing himself deep into its embrace as he closes his eyes.
Rather than looking at maps and military sand tables, he much prefers listening to the subtle sounds of snow falling on branches, making them rustle and creak under its weight. It reminds him of the sound of waves of wheat—
Rustling under the moonlit breeze—
[name="Slippery Soldier"]Boss? What's the matter?
[name="Seasoned Soldier"]Don't mind him, he's probably just drunk off his gourd. Let's get back to what we were talking about just now.
[name="Seasoned Soldier"]I heard that the Leithanians want to build a new city, mostly to get foreign trade going. Check out these preferential policies. The calculated returns for investments are unreal...
But reality never goes the way he wishes it to.
Just like how his father always yelled at him to get out of the wheat field and to continue his training at home.
Just like when his pipe stem loses a piece without him knowing.
Just like how his lost leg would never return.

His voice is somewhat hoarse.
The rustling of wheat in the wind has stopped.
