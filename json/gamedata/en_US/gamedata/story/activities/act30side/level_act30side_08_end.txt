Is she the same as this Victorian?
They don't seem very identical.
She's Leithanien-born, Kazimierz-raised, and only then came to Kjerag.
They don't need to know her name. All they know is she's born to fight solo, a victor of the knight competitions, the only one to ever win three years running.
Turn the clock further back, and she's a freak cut off from Originium Arts, a pariah in Leithanien.
Gaining and losing any of these things is dead simple.
They bore her to death.
But now, what she has isn't so easily lost, and she has no plans to lose them.
Now, they <i>are</i> the same.

...What's that noise?
It's not anyone splashing into the icewater, and it's not cries for help.
It sounds like someone loudly saying something, and then the people all about her stumble in disarray.
That loud voice. But whatever it's saying, she can't tell clearly.
Her field of view narrows and dims by a fraction more. The sounds almost turn to fuzz in her ears.
She can't feel her own limbs anymore, but she can be sure she still has a grip on her old companions.
Her degenbrechers.
Because she knows her body is still acting on reflex, striking down every person that comes near.
It's just... too loud.
Too loud. How can someone talk this noisily?
Why has the crowd gone?
Did someone breach her line of defense already?
No.
The wild beast's dulling eyes of gold suddenly flare alight.
—As long as she can stand.
—She will allow absolutely no one past!

[name="Harold"]Kept between Victoria and Kjerag, one might still call it the Duke's personal Silverash grievances. But the moment you bring Kazimierz into it too, things become far, far less simple.

Degenbrecher lifts her head to look to the dawn.
In the distance, two figures walk, approaching her. She still can't make them out, but she knows who they are.
It's like Kjeragandr on high is gazing down on her, someplace as high as the sun.
