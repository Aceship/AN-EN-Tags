The Saintess stands at the head of the crowd, and takes the first step onto the ice.
The frozen Lake Silberneherze shines like a flawless gem when looked upon from afar.
But only once you stand atop it will you see that this 'gem' is covered in chips and cracks.
The ice is covered in cracks wending and weaving across the surface, the endlessly churning waters beneath the ice surging about together. Under the dawn light, it is as if the soul of the lake itself was wandering about in an eternal cycle.
In the eyes of the people of Kjerag, such a sight was so beautiful as to be breathtaking.
Kjeragandr's Saintess steps across the cracks that seemed like they were carved by the biting winds, as if walking past a millennium's worth of Kjerag's bitterly cold hardships, as if walking past its endless winter days.
Because now, spring was just around the corner.

[name="Sciurus"]The walls of the private rooms of that original train are inlaid with materials designed to isolate the occupants from disturbances from outside, so naturally, they will cut off communication signals too.

From time to time, Degenbrecher thinks back to ten years ago.
Back then, every winter she would accompany Enciodes all across Kjerag.
That young man who had just returned to his home country was not yet the deeply experienced person he was now, still quite underripe. He had to do many things himself, rushing about to and fro.
One could say that he was hot-blooded, or one could say that he had ambition.
Degenbrecher remembered that in the winter of that year, Enciodes brought all his plans and stratagems that he had devised in Victoria back to Kjerag, where he single-handedly founded Karlan Trade.
Of the few people who could be called his confidants, she would have just barely been within their number.
And thus, she found herself staying in this cold, snowy land.
If you were to ask her, while she has long gotten used to the bitter chill, she does not actually like cold weather very much.
Kazimierz's winters were cold indeed.
Those days, she would make her way through many matches of the Majors in winter. This made the KGCC very unhappy, but whether or not her opponent was happy was never in her mind.
Going back even further, Leithanien's winters too, were cold.
Was Kjerag's winter not colder than Kazimierz's or Leithanien's?
Degenbrecher stamped her foot upon the ice's surface, frost crystals breaking loose under her step.

All about him, frost blanketed the icy surface of Lake Silberneherze, mist gathered in the air, and in the distance, the statue of Kjeragandr loomed, Her face fuzzy and indistinct.
The chill extending all about Her feet made people feel as though they had truly entered the realm of a snow god. The frozen surface of the lake looked as though it was a great shard of rock sugar, covered in icing.
In this unreal, dreamlike environment, these men wearing their valor on their sleeve stood out like a sore thumb, and across from them—
A vague silhouette appeared within the dense fog that laid thick in the air.
Their adversary walked forward, step by step, treading atop the ice and snow towards them. It felt like with every step, she commanded the strength to stop a thousand men in their tracks.
