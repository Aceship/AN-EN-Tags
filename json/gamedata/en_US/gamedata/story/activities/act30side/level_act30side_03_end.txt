Come, Rosalind, let's learn how to pray to Kjeragandr.
Close your eyes, put your hands before your chest, and call out Kjeragandr's name silently in your heart...
Good job, Rosalind.
You're Mama and Papa's sweetheart, Rosalind.
Mama could never regret giving birth to you, no matter what people might say.
May Kjeragandr bless...
