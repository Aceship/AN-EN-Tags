[name="Enya"]Seeing as how you're eloquent as ever, you seem to have no shortage of confidence.
[name="Enya"]You've been quite busy making a name for yourself, Sir Enciodes. Though I rarely go down the mountain, news of Karlan Trade's exploits are regularly reaching my ears.
[name="Enya"]But, please do not forget this, Sir Enciodes. For thousands of years, Kjerag has relied on hard work and pragmatism from generation to generation to develop our homeland into what it is today, not utilitarianism and reckless adventurism.
[name="Enciodes"]The Silverashes will never forget Kjeragandr's admonition of Her people.
[name="Enciodes"]However, the Saintess must also understand that along with the people of Kjerag's hard work and pragmatism is an indomitable adventuring spirit, and a desire to ascend the highest summits.
[name="Enciodes"]Perhaps a little bit of this spirit is also what we need when it comes to dealing with external developments.

[name="Enciodes"]The Saintess remains unmoving and... speaks bluntly for the first time in a long while.
[name="Enya"]I can't hold a candle to you in that regard.
[name="Enya"]But it seems that even after all these years, our great Sir Enciodes still has not learned to retain his capital.
[name="Enciodes"]To what does the Great Saintess refer?
[name="Enya"]Have your old habits not flared up again? Taking on every bit of risk with no regard for the consequences?
[name="Enciodes"]The greater the risk, the greater the reward.
[name="Enya"]I hope you won't regret your choices later on down the road.
[name="Enya"]Nobody's going to sneak money under your pillow today!
[name="Enciodes"]Indeed, that won't be happening again.
[name="Enciodes"]No longer will I be woken by the jingling of coins, or have to buy candies and snacks on margin and pay back thrice the amount.

[name="Harold"]But, if the Saintess has her own thoughts about Kjerag's present situation...
[name="Harold"]Then, reciprocating the Duke's offer may be the perfect option for you.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]I recall the time I paid a medical call to a herdsman, Leones was his name. A young beast in his herd had gotten lost while grazing.
[name="Harold"]I offered to help him search for it, but he declined and told me not to worry.
[name="Harold"]He had me wait until sundown, and left to have supper.
[name="Harold"]And so I waited.
[name="Harold"]After finishing the treatment, I set up a cooking pot over the grass with him. We lit the pot, and he found a good piece of cheese. You should've heard the sizzling sound it made when he threw it in.
[name="Harold"]I was sitting to the side on a short bench, still thinking about the young beast, when I heard a high-pitched cry in the distance.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#12$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]This might be something you see all the time in Kjerag.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#14$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]But for me, when I saw that young beast returning to the pasture at sunset; the way it found its way back to its mothers side, the two nuzzling against each other––
[name="Harold"]What I felt at that moment... was something I don't know how to describe.
[name="Harold"]Old Leones told me that burdenbeasts recognize the scent of their kin, especially foals, which are particularly sensitive to their mother's scent.
[name="Harold"]Even if they get lost, they'll always find their way back by following their mother's scent.
[name="Harold"]That blood bond reminds me of the way the people of Kjerag view their land.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]It reminds me... of the way Sir Enciodes gave up Victoria in all her glory to return to Kjerag.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]I see Your Lordship speaks very highly of Sir Enciodes. It is true that he has made many achievements thus far––
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]But if you are comparing him to a young burdenbeast returning to his homeland thanks to his ties with his 'mother' by the name of Kjerag, I find that joke quite droll.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#12$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]It is indeed thanks to Sir Enciodes's longing for his homeland that House Caster decided to fund Karlan Trade.
[name="Harold"]Moreover, the Duke believed that since Sir Enciodes greatly treasured the Kjerag blood flowing in his veins, he likewise would not come to despise the other half of his blood–
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]The Caster bloodline.
[name="Harold"]Holy Saintess, as I have previously stated, I am not here to stoke conflict.
[name="Harold"]But, at the inception of Karlan Trade, it was Caster who extended a helping hand to Sir Enciodes.
[name="Harold"]And now that Sir Enciodes has proven his worth, the Duke believes that it is time to collect a bit of interest.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#3$1",focus="m")]

[name="Harold"]Her Grace wishes to see this goodwill from Sir Enciodes, from Karlan Trade, and ultimately, from Kjerag itself.

[name="Enya"]I cannot come up here and confidently proclaim that the ways of the past were wrong.
[name="Enya"]Sir Enciodes always boasts about how he was the one who chose Kjerag's current path.
[name="Enya"]However, to this day, everything in Kjerag is the result of decisions that we have collectively made as a people, of which I am but one member.
