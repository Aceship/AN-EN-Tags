Ladies and gentlemen, we have arrived at our terminus—
Lake Silberneherze Station.
Located in the center of a basin, clear and scenic Lake Silberneherze is one of the gems of Kjerag.
Legends say that it is the first tear shed by Kjeragandr. In winter, one can walk on the frozen surface and see into the depths of the lake.
The newly-built statue of Kjeragandr stands on an island in the middle of the lake, watching over Kjerag and her people.
