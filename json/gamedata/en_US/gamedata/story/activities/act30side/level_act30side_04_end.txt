[name="Harold"]I'm afraid you might have some misunderstandings about me, good sir.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_172_svrash_1#10$1",focus="r")]
[name="Enciodes"]Then it is natural for me to wish to clear up those misunderstandings. Come, let us sit and discuss them.

[name="Harold"]Ah, well... the Saintess hasn't arrived yet, so should we really be sitting?

[name="Enciodes"]The Great Saintess is quite occupied with various affairs at the moment. There is no need to trouble her over this.

[name="Harold"]Great Saintess, I'm honored that you have deigned to grace this banquet with your presence.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]It has been quite some time since you first set foot in Kjerag, Lord Viscount.
[name="Enya"]In that time, I've heard of the goodwill that you have shown Kjerag, and I had plans myself to reach out to you for our own little chat.
[name="Enya"]Today is as good an opportunity as any other.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enciodes"]It has been a while, Saintess.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]Sir Enciodes... You still have not answered my question.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enciodes"]The Saintess is correct.
[name="Enciodes"]It's just that you are the spiritual leader of all Kjerag's people, after all.
[name="Enciodes"]Every day, you must hear the hopes and prayers of supplicants, and keep their faith in Kjeragandr in their hearts.
[name="Enciodes"]Nowadays all the nations of Terra have heard tell of Her, and one by one they set their eyes on Her. This too, is yet another matter that occupies your attention.
[name="Enciodes"]There is no need for you to personally attend to the mundane matters of the nation.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]You tell a good joke, Sir Enciodes.
[name="Enya"]The reason why Kjeragandr attracts more and more attention from the outside world is in fact because we take note of our people's hopes and prayers, and that we work towards a better life for all of them.
[name="Enya"]And that being the case, it means that there is no such thing as a mundane matter of the nation.
[name="Enya"]It need only be a matter of concern to the people to be a matter of concern to me.
[name="Enya"]I am sure that you would understand this simple reasoning of mine, right, Sir Enciodes?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enciodes"]I understand this point. As a good friend of mine once counselled me, whether in family matters or matters of state, if you try to grasp everything at play, it will often times not go as you planned.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]And as a good friend once counselled <i>me</i>, whether in family matters or matters of state, even if you cannot attend to everything personally, you must see things through your own eyes and do things with your own hands at least once.
[name="Enya"]Do you hold family matters in your heart, Sir Enciodes, or matters of state?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enciodes"]What is it that you wish to see, Great Saintess? What is it that you wish to do?

[name="Harold"]Ah, Great Saintess, just before you arrived, Sir Enciodes gifted me a bottle of liquor.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]Oh?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]'Snow Realm Spring 1072'.

[name="Enya"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]A drink so fine, its only flaw is that it will upstage the main dish.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_172_svrash_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enciodes"]It is my gift to you. Are you afraid that it might steal your thunder as our host?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]Hardly, hardly.
[name="Harold"]While I am the host, I can't really call myself the lord of this place, can I?
[name="Harold"]I would say that the Saintess herself would be considered the star of the evening.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_172_svrash_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enciodes"]It seems I have overstepped my bounds.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]If I may, Saintess, I have a proposal.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]Go ahead.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]I think we should use this bottle of 1072 as the drink for tonight's meal.
[name="Harold"]What do you think?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]What say you, Sir Enciodes?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_172_svrash_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enciodes"]...In 1072, when our father placed these bottles into our cellar, he believed that Kjerag's spring was just around the corner.
[name="Enciodes"]But even after waiting for more than twenty years, our spring has still not yet truly arrived.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_172_svrash_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enciodes"]Now, if this bottle were a signal for the opportunity before us, that would truly be a wonderful thing.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]Eloquent as ever, Sir Enciodes.
[name="Enya"]Now that matter's settled, Kjarr.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_250_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Kjarr"]Yes, Saintess?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]Take this bottle to the kitchen, if you would.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_250_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Kjarr"]At once, Saintess.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_174_slbell_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Enya"]Is that to your satisfaction, My Lord?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]Well, since our two guests of honor have arrived... Let's get this banquet started.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4114_harold_1#14$1",focus="m")]
[name="Harold"]Please, have a seat.
