Each area will unlock only after completing the previous zone's simulations.
[Tutorial(focusX=-170, focusY=-10, focusWidth=350, focusHeight=500, anchor="Right",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] There are three combat simulations in each zone. The simulations' difficulty increases in numerical order, and the third simulation serves as a Breakpoint Operation. Simulations are not linked to each other and may be challenged freely.
