[name="Conviction"]   Closure said she wanted to make a game, and in an instant that scene came to me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_380_1")]
[name="Conviction"]   As for the finer points, Closure has been hard at work developing, ironing out the details, making my art so suffused with beauty and longing a material reality. Yes, this is the duality of the engineer's spirit.
[Character(name="avg_npc_380_1")]
[name="Conviction"]   Thus, though it may be a demo version, I say it's already the peak of all magna opera.

[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#5")]
[name="Closure"]   That's the Closure difference.
[Character(name="avg_npc_380_1")]
[name="Conviction"]   Appropriate difficulty, impeccable game balance. A sublime experience that both satisfies the wants of high-level players and accommodates for those with relatively less gift for gaming.
[Character(name="char_007_closre_1#2")]
[name="Closure"]   Goes without saying.
