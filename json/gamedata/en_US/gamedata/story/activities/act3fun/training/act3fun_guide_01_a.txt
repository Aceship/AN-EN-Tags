[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_peacok_fool")] You're now here at the 'Soldiers Assemble: Barrage Fortress!' training tutorial.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Yup. We didn't have enough time to get this part voiced, so Conviction and I will personally walk you through it.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_peacok_fool")] You might see me <@tu.kw>zooming around</> on a hovercraft. Don't be too shocked though, because this is a game, and you've gotta break the mold!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_peacok_fool")] How else would you get to fight alongside Master Conviction, were this not a game?
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_closure", animStyle="Drag",           startX=-300, startY=-150, endX=-100, endY=-150)] But now, onto business! Doctor, all you need to do is <@tu.kw>swipe anywhere on the <@tu.kw>screen</> to freely move the hovercraft.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_closure", animStyle="Drag",           startX=-300, startY=-150, endX=-300, endY=0)] Just like this.
[Tutorial(focusX=-63, focusY=204, focusWidth=124, focusHeight=57,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", anchor="BottomRight",black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] It's a bit different from how you're usually used to fighting, but you'll still <@tu.kw>need to use</> Deployment Points.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_peacok_fool")] How's that? True to life, but also larger than life. Now THAT is art!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] By the way, Conviction... Are you not going to swap out the fists for bullets?
[Tutorial(focusX=-400, focusY=60, focusWidth=91, focusHeight=85,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Look, it seems like you're continuously firing out your own... '<@tu.kw>fists</>.'
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_peacok_fool")] And I personally think the fists aren't conspicuous enough! After all, this is the Conviction Fist infused with artistry and nostalgia we're talking about here! And you still want the Master to use a gun or something?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Alright then.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] That pretty much sums up the basics. I can see you're already gearing up, Doctor, but there's still one more important rule––
[Tutorial(focusX=-463, focusY=53, focusWidth=164, focusHeight=148,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] If you want to clear a stage, you'd better <@tu.kw>protect</> <@tu.kw>Conviction</>, and beat the boss at the end!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_peacok_fool")] Hey, are you paying attention?! If something bad happens to me in the game, I won't hesitate to convict you out here!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] By the way...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] You've given yourself way too much HP!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_peacok_fool")] Hahaha, details, details!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] In any case, let the games... BEGIN!
