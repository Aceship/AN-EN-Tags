[name="Conviction"]   I sense some confusion in you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_380_1")]
[name="Conviction"]   It seems we shouldn't place too much hope in you, considering your taste and appreciation for art, or lack thereof.
[Character(name="avg_npc_380_1")]
[name="Conviction"]   If you have any questions, ask them now. And I shall answer.

[Character(name="avg_npc_380_1")]
[name="Conviction"]   As Rhodes Island's combat commander, you should be reflecting on your own gaming ability rather than pointing the finger at Closure!

[Character(name="avg_npc_380_1")]
[name="Conviction"]   But she hasn't taken us up on it yet.
[Character(name="avg_npc_380_1")]
