[name="Woman"]  Do you really have to go?
[name="Woman"]  I saw the news. Things are heating up between the mob and the police.
[name="Woman"]  I saw blood. Lots of people bleeding...
[name="Man"]  Don’t worry, honey, things aren’t that bad.
[name="Man"]  It’s just the media playing things up. \"If it bleeds, it leads,\" you know. That’s how they get paid.
[name="Man"]  Don’t let them scare you.
[name="Woman"]  But...
[name="Woman"]  The man at the smoke shop says not so many nobles come by for liquor anymore. And Aunt Nina, who works at Lord Santelli’s estate, came home. She says the Lord’s entire staff is furloughed.
[name="Woman"]  Don’t you think... don’t you think that means——
[name="Man"]  You know nothing!
[name="Woman"]  ......
[name="Man"]  ...Sorry. I shouldn’t have raised my voice. 
[name="Woman"]  Loban, I’m just... I’m just so worried.
[name="Man"]  I said not to worry. Don’t be scared. I’m here. You can trust me. I will protect you. 
[name="Man"]  And it’s not only me. I have the rest of the Guard garrison with me, and the Army is just outside the city too. There’s nothing to be afraid of.
[name="Woman"]  Loban...
[name="Man"]  Relax, Darya. We swore to protect this city, and this home. 
[name="Man"]  Let’s not trouble your pretty little head. This winter will pass, and when the weather warms up, we’ll go someplace nice. How does that sound?
[name="Man"]  And don’t tell Zoya. Let it be just the two of us, off on a romantic getaway. Alright?
[name="Woman"]  ...hehe.
[name="Woman"]  How are you still like this, even at your age?
[name="Woman"]  It’s so cold. Where are we going to go for a romantic getaway when the snow melts and the roads turn to mud?
[name="Man"]  Isn’t that the perfect way to end the winter? When the time comes, we’ll go dancing, you’ll bring some mead from home, and I’ll bake you cookies myself.
[name="Woman"]  Oho, bold words, do you still remember how? I think... we could. Just wait for Zoya to go back to school. When she’s safely in her dormitory, we’ll head off.
[name="Man"]  Sure! Now, how long until school starts? Could we move her in early?
[name="Woman"]  You know nothing!
[name="Woman"]  Zoya? We were just talking about you. Come, your father’s on the night shift. Say goodbye.

There were happy moments that at that time erupted suddenly with such potency, they brought an unparalleled sense of being.
Or maybe they felt very ordinary. Only in retrospect do I realize what the feeling was.
Everyday conversations for a monotonous life.
As if Spring would come as usual. As if the snow would melt, the people would tie the hay into straw men, and trample about the mud amidst the aroma of pale mead.
The usual greetings: good morning, good evening, hello, goodbye.
Until that day——
Our city, before our very eyes, twisted, deformed, erupted.

[name="Reunion Squad Leader"]  That school is a ways away from the one they stationed us at. And if Mephisto is up to something, there’s not much we can do...

[name="Reunion Squad Leader"]  But yeah, it’s normal to be angry.... with what he did this time.

I’d never seen this side of the city.
Houses were destroyed, roads blocked, windows sealed up, broken bricks strewn across the street like so many toy blocks.
Smoke rose from the fires all around me, carrying sorrowful wails on the wind.
All while the armed men cheered, carving their symbols on every surface they could find. I heard their name. The murderers said it with pride.
They called themselves——Reunion.

[name="Valery"]  The Army has not come. Seems to be some communication trouble. We have no idea what’s going on with them.
[name="Valery"]  It’s just us Guardsmen. There’s not much we can do to stop them. But at least you’ll be a little safer with us.

[name="???"]  What is he doing over there?

[name="Valery"]  Haven’t you heard? The Infected locked up another group of kids in Peterheim, just like your school.
[name="Valery"]  It’s weird. They don’t seem to be doing anything to them. No movement out of there.
[name="Valery"]  But there’s been some news in the last few days. Reunion seems to be pulling out. No matter what they’re up to, we have to have a countermeasure in place.
[name="Valery"]  We can’t spare much manpower. Only a few districts are calm, and others are so out of control that we could only send a small team to Peterheim.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_ed_1")]
[name="???"]  Meaning, my dad?

[name="Valery"]  He volunteered. Your father’s experienced. As long as he’s with them, I’m not worried.

[name="???"]  We don’t have time to waste. The situation is getting more dangerous by the second. And if help isn’t coming, you’re only going to need more help. So why not take it from me?
[name="???"]  I’ve watched how they operate at my school. I know how they patrol, I know how many men they put in a squad.

[name="Valery"]  I know I can’ stop you. Honestly, I have too much on my plate right now to worry about watching you. What you do now is entirely on you.
[name="Valery"]  But... Zoya, bear in mind, you are not a public servant. We are here to protect you.
