[name="Dobermann"]  Doesn’t it remind you of those three?
[name="Dobermann"]  They don’t know where courage comes from,, so they bite down and take on society, no matter their age.
[name="Dobermann"]  But they do seem to be ready.
[Predicate(references="3")]
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Yes she is. Honestly, she exceeds my expectations.
[name="Dobermann"]  An aristocratic young lady who can actually work hard for herself... hah.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  I do understand Amiya’s instinct to keep them off the battlefield.
[name="Dobermann"]  Doctor, no one would be happy to send young people to war. Isn’t the point of a soldier like me to protect kids like that?
[name="Dobermann"]  I always blame myself for them having to go to war.
[name="Dobermann"]  But I’ve come to terms with the fact that I can’t save everyone.
[name="Dobermann"]  All I can do is teach them to fight, to protect themselves, and to get home in one piece.
[name="Dobermann"]  Think about it, Doctor, what can you do for them?

[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  ...Yes. That’s why I’ve been paying more attention to them.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]
[name="Amiya"]  Sorry, Doctor, I... wasn’t sure if I should tell anyone about this.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  You know about my ability to sense a person’s most powerful emotions, and to even feel them when they’re directed at me.
[name="Amiya"]  If they’re not directed at me, but still strong enough, I can’t feel them as clearly, but I can still sense something.
[name="Amiya"]  And the Ursus girls... it’s hard to say.
[name="Amiya"]  Their situation is different.
[name="Amiya"]  At times, times that would seem ordinary to us, I will sense immense, overpowering emotion from them.
[name="Amiya"]  Of course, their emotions are different, but they share some commonalities.
[name="Amiya"]  If I had to put a name to the main emotion, I think I’d have to say \"helplessness.\"
[name="Amiya"]  They are not so sad, not pained, not angry, not hopeless...
[name="Amiya"]  Maybe it’s not the right word. It’s like... like there’s an invisible wall.
[name="Amiya"]  It’s usually invisible and intangible, but it blocks them whenever they try to move forward. And they’re stuck.
[Decision(options="Is there anything we can do for them?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6")]
[name="Amiya"]  No.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  We are in no position to help them now, Doctor.
[name="Amiya"]  What each operator is willing to tell us when they register their file, that’s all we \"can\" know about them.
[name="Amiya"]  They may be hiding something from us. But if so, we have even less reason to dig it up.
[name="Amiya"]  Of course, that doesn’t include things that might adversely affect Rhodes Island. But I don’t think Zima’s group falls into that category.
[name="Amiya"]  Also...
[name="Amiya"]  I’m not sure us suddenly reaching out to help them would actually be helpful.
[Decision(options="Unprompted help is a selfish act.;......;We could just ask them.", values="1;2;3")]

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3")]
[name="Amiya"]  Yes, I think so too.
[Predicate(references="2")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  Maybe it’s just that I’m a little afraid to do it.
[Predicate(references="3")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2")]
[name="Amiya"]  Oh, Doctor, you’re teasing again.
[name="Amiya"]  If only it were that simple.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  I feel like \"I understand you\" isn’t worth much.
[name="Amiya"]  But people love to say it. As if it fulfills their duty to provide comfort, or that it will make someone open up to them.
[name="Amiya"]  It’s hard to understand someone’s feelings, let alone help them.
[name="Amiya"]  Many operators onboard this vessel are the same, actually.
[name="Amiya"]  We don’t share any particular experience with them, our words don’t get through to them, and what we do, even if it’s right, won’t be what they want.
[Decision(options="So you didn’t stop the Ursus girls from becoming operators.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  Right.
[name="Amiya"]  After sensing their emotions, I changed my mind.
[name="Amiya"]  Forcing them to safety may seem to us like the right move, like it’s best for them. And it probably would keep them safe, in practice.
[name="Amiya"]  But that would not help them heal.
[name="Amiya"]  Doctor, I really don’t want to say that time heals all wounds. 
[name="Amiya"]  But I don’t know any other way.
[name="Amiya"]  All I can do is respect their choice, and protect them in my own, Rhodes Island way.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]
[name="Amiya"]  When I think about it like that, I feel kind of full of myself...
[Decision(options="Rhodes Island isn’t a greenhouse. You’re on the right track.;......;Then just make friends with everyone.", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  Yes, but I always hope I can do more.
[Predicate(references="2")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  Doctor, how to or whether to treat someone, from a physical perspective, is rarely something that needs consideration.
[name="Amiya"]  But when it comes to mental health, it becomes a more difficult problem.
[name="Amiya"]  For now, I can give only a vague answer.
[Predicate(references="3")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3")]
[name="Amiya"]  yes, you’re right.
[name="Amiya"]  If we aren’t in a position to help someone, we msut create the position.
[name="Amiya"]  I’m just a little frustrated.
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  Medicine is for pain, to heal wounds. And some medicines can heal, but in any case, they can’t erase the pain and suffering endured before the medicine is applied.
[name="Amiya"]  I’ve always wondered if Rhodes Island could help some people, even if only a few, to forget, or at least let go of the trauma they’ve suffered in the past.
[name="Amiya"]  I’ve realized along the way that it’s really hard.
[name="Amiya"]  Developing the drug is only the most basic first step. There’s so much more we would have to do to be able to achieve this.
[Decision(options="At least we’re already doing it.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3")]
[name="Amiya"]  Yeah. There’s that.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2")]
[name="Amiya"]  Thanks, Doctor.
[name="Amiya"]  I’m kind of embarrassed that you’re comforting and encouraging me over someone else’s business...
[name="Amiya"]  Anyway, to business, I’m approving Miss Natalya’s application.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3")]
[name="Amiya"]  I hope that one day she and her friends are willing to open up to us. I hope that one day, we are able to help them.
[name="Amiya"]  I hope that one day... Rhodes Island can become their now home.
