[name="Vanguard Operator"]  This unripe texture, this slightly-too-salty flavor, oh, I’m finally home again!
[name="Logistics Operator"]  It was just a long mission. You don’t have to kiss the deck.
[name="Vanguard Operator"]  Hey, you don’t know how I take to Ursus food. It really doesn’t agree with me.
[name="Vanguard Operator"]  Our canteen’s way better. I like everything here.
[name="Logistics Operator"]  The way you just put it, it doesn’t exactly sound like you like it.
[name="Vanguard Operator"]  Something doesn’t have to taste good for me to like it.
[name="Vanguard Operator"]  I helped some survivors find their relatives and they thanked me with a banquet. A big, classy, noble shindig.
[name="Vanguard Operator"]  But let’s just say my palate isn’t so refined.
[name="Logistics Operator"]  Yeah, sure. You’re totally dependent on the Rhodes Island Cafeteria.
[name="Logistics Operator"]  So what was the mission?
[name="Vanguard Operator"]  I’m pretty sure you know the deal. Resettling the refugees from Chernobog in other Ursus cities. Easy stuff, but time-consuming.
[name="Logistics Operator"]  Forget I asked. I know how much refugee ops mean to you.
[name="Vanguard Operator"]  Yeah. There’s only so much we can do when there’s so many of them and so few of us. But a life saved is a life saved.
[name="Vanguard Operator"]  I heard Dobermann talking about how we’re not in the best position with Ursus right now, so it’s great that Amiya and the Doctor are still willing to do these rescue operations.
[name="Logistics Operator"]  Sure. We lucked out with those two.
[name="Logistics Operator"]  Well, there’s another one we owe a lot of thanks too.
[name="Vanguard Operator"]  Oh yeah, I heard about her out on the road. Some girl named Natalya?
[name="Logistics Operator"]  Right. She’s a big celebrity here now.

[name="Natalya"]  Good afternoon, Mr. Saren. And you are...?
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Vanguard Operator"]  Codename Compass. Nice to meet you.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1")]
[name="Natalya"]  Compass.. a fine codename. Good afternoon. Would you mind if I joined you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Operator Saren"]  By all means!
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Compass"]  Hey, didn’t I hear she was just a student?
[name="Compass"]  This is no little girl! She’s *gulp* pretty big!
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  What do you think \"student\" means?
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Compass"]  I don’t know how to talk to a lady like this!
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  Relax. Natalya’s real easy-going.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1")]
[name="Natalya"]  Did I happen to overhear that the good Compass has just returned from resettling refugees?
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Compass"]  That’s right. We were just talking about it.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  I was telling him all that you did to help.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Oh my role was completely trivial.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  You’re too modest. If it wasn’t for Natalya pushing the survivors along, we would’ve had a much tougher time.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Compass"]  The refugees were talking about her too. They said there was a kind young lady who told them Rhodes Island is good people.
[name="Compass"]  And after hearing it right from Saren, I really gotta thank you, Miss Natalya.
[name="Compass"]  The refugees having a good image of us makes all the difference in the world. Without you, I know things would’ve gone bad out there.
[name="Compass"]  I mean, I was a refugee too. I know how they think. But it still sucks when you’re trying to do good and people don’t trust you.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  I did the absolute bare minimum. It was you out there doing the real work, Compass.
[name="Natalya"]  And it’s not that they don’t trust Rhodes Island. It’s that they’ve suffered a Catastrophe and they don’t trust anyone.
[name="Natalya"]  I sensed that Rhodes Island had everyone’s best interests at heart. And having been Student Council President, I was used to this business. It’s what I’m good at.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Compass"]  You hear that, Saren? This is how you talk to people. Listen up.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  Didn’t I just say Natalya is easy-going?
[name="Operator Saren"]  When word got around that the new kid was some aristocratic heiress, we were all worried about getting along.
[name="Operator Saren"]  But it turns out she’s good at her job, easy to talk to, super easy to get along with. We all love Natalya.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1")]
[name="Natalya"]  Oh my no. Everyone’s only willing to put up with me because I’m so young.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Compass"]  Speaking of, did you decide to stay with Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  I did. I passed the Logistics Department’s examination last week. I am now formally employed by Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Compass"]  Wow, that’s great news. You’re gonna love it here, trust me.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  I’m already very pleased.
[name="Natalya"]  As long as we’re on the subject, Mr. Saren, I’ve finished compiling the second refugee manifest, pairing names with destinations. If you wouldn’t mind sending it along after lunch.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  What? Already?
[name="Operator Saren"]  That means the refugees we saved all have somewhere to go?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Yes. Aside from those who are still undergoing treatment. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  Incredible. It’s a good thing the section chief put you on the task.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  I’m only doing my duty.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Compass"]  I guess I’d better go put in for the second resettlement op then.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  You want to head out there again? Didn’t you just get done telling me you can’t stand Ursus food?
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Compass"]  Yeah, but seeing the survivors return to their homes and their relatives, seeing them so happy makes up for it.
[name="Compass"]  Right, I’m about done with lunch. Help me with the tray, will you? I gotta go apply.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  Hey, bus your own tray!
[name="Operator Saren"]  Sorry about him, Natalya. That’s just how he is.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1")]
[name="Natalya"]  Our good Compass has quite the attachment to the refugees...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  He does. You heard him say he was a refugee too, right? One of our teams saved him, so he’s pretty gung ho about any ops that have to do with refugees.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  And you seem to get along well?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  Oh, yeah. I guess we do. He was in Logistics for a bit, before transferring to the front lines. We had some time together, our personalities clicked, and so we’re friends. 
[name="Operator Saren"]  You’re with that Ursus Student Self-government Group, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Yes. But Son... Zima and the girls are front line operators like Compass, and I’m in Logistics.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  I heard you were all found together. You’re very close too?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  ...Yes, yes we are. We were together all that time. We’re very close.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Operator Saren"]  You went through it as a group. That’s good. Err, not to say that kind of hardship is good.

[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Sonya, there are some things that are harder to say to those closest to you.
[name="Natalya"]  If you were my friend, I would not have brought you here.
[name="Natalya"]  Some things can only be said to someone unimportant, someone who understands your situation.
[name="Natalya"]  For me, the best person is Anna. But you’ll do.
[name="Natalya"]  Mmm... Rosalind is too direct and open. While Lada is too honest and kindhearted. They won’t do.
[name="Natalya"]  Surely you feel the same. Which means you have only me, I’m afraid. I’m honestly not surprised you came to me.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  What do you mean \"feel?\" It’s just fighting. I guess it does suck to have to listen to that Doctor.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Your talking back to the Doctor even made it up to Logistics. You’re quite something.

[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  ...I like fighting.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  I see... Still, I think it would be in your best interest to learn some \"fancy talk.\" It could save your life.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  You don’t have to worry.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  We may not be friends, but we’ve been through so much together. I think it’s normal to care about you, as a colleague.
[name="Natalya"]  And to tell the truth, I do quite like you. I would like to be your friend.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  ...Huh?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  To be more precise, I’d say I envy you. Because you do so easily what I could never do.
[name="Natalya"]  Now then, Sonya, won’t you tell me what made you seek me out?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  ...I've been having nightmares lately.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Can you describe them to me?

[name="Zima"]  ...No.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Alright. Let me guess. They must be something you can’t talk to Anna about. Otherwise you wouldn’t have come to me, right?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  ...Right.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  I figured it out while we were still in Chernobog.
[name="Natalya"]  You two have an understanding. You each know what the other needs, but you avoid talking about it.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  None of your business.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Relax, I’m not trying to tell you what to do. I’m in no position to be giving advice to others right now.
[name="Natalya"]  Let’s talk about something else, Sonya. Do you plan to live your life as Zima now?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  What do you mean?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  I mean are you going to stay at Rhodes Island?
[name="Natalya"]  We don’t have to. The people here are very understanding. If we wanted to leave, they would send us off somewhere peaceful.
[name="Natalya"]  There are many survivors like us, rescued at the same time, already on their way back to Ursus.
[name="Natalya"]  If we wanted to, we could go to another city in the Empire and start new lives.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  So why haven’t you left?

[name="Natalya"]  We left that place, Sonya. We’ve returned to the civilized world.
[name="Natalya"]  We must think as civilized people. We must use civilized methods to solve our problems. Those things that happened back there cannot happen again.

[name="Natalya"]  Since you brought me back, I don’t think I’ve ever told you what happened to me before you showed up, did I?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Nope. I just know you were in charge of that gang of nobles.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  I’ll tell you the story sometime.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Whatever.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Most of the nobility and wealthy people fled the city when Reunion came, or even before.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  They know they were coming?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Yes. They did.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  ...sons of bitches.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Indeed. But you know, nobles are selfish.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  You too?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Yes.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  So why did you stay?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  My family was just too slow. We were trapped with some other noble families. Some houses didn’t take the threat seriously, of course.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Oh.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Come now, don’t give me that face. This background is important to frame the story. We’ll get to the good part.
[name="Natalya"]  In short, the students who were sent to that school fell into one of two categories of noble scion.
[name="Natalya"]  We were at first meant to stay with our parents, for Reunion to use as hostages to bargain with the Empire. But in the end, we were separated and sent to the school.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  That’s kinda weird.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  It was. Nobles make good hostages in a time of war. Not to be wasted.
[name="Natalya"]  The aristocracy is elegant, noble, and should command respect. Even as a captive, one must never forget her house.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  You’re all screwed in the head.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  The old me would have locked you in a two hour debate for saying that, Sonya. Because that’s how I was raised.
[name="Natalya"]  But now, I agree.
[name="Natalya"]  There is no real difference between nobles and commoners. It’s all window dressing. Scrape off the veneer and the aristocracy is truly ugly.
[name="Natalya"]  We talked about how if it weren’t for the first fire, if it we didn’t lose that food store, things wouldn’t have gotten so bad.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  But Anna said even without the fire, something else would have happened.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  If I had been through that, I would have thought the same.
[name="Natalya"]  But in any case, it’s post-hoc—— \"What needed to happen to cause all that came after.\"
[name="Natalya"]  The funny thing is, nobles don’t need anything to happen. Put them together and they fight.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Why?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Should I get into the differences between new and old nobility? The mayor’s political leanings? How many factions there are in the Chernobog aristocracy?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Could you, like, not do that?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  But then you won’t understand why they fight.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  I guess I’ll never understand.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  I’m not really interested in these things either. But as a daughter of the House of Rostov, I had to know.
[name="Natalya"]  All you need to know is that from the very first day we were locked up in the school, the noble students were backstabbing each other.
[name="Natalya"]  I had no choice but to step forward as the Student Council President of #4 Secondary School and use my status to bring order.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  You mean you organized them to put an end to the infighting?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Sounds reasonable, doesn’t it? In order to stop my classmates from fighting, I stood up and took charge.

[name="Natalya"]  Sonya, do you know why the Empire of Ursus is as strong as it is?
[name="Natalya"]  In fact, there were quite a few noble students who were unwilling to submit to my authority, or share the same room with someone else, and left the group.
[name="Natalya"]  In the end, I had some three dozen under me.
[name="Natalya"]  At the time, I thought I had done very well.

[name="Natalya"]  Oh, I’m sorry. I do have more to say, but it’s hard to get the words out.
[name="Natalya"]  Ursus is what it is today because of war. The previous monarch waged endless war, pillaging resources, and investing them in the next campaign.

[name="Natalya"]  But is that true?

[name="Natalya"]  Do you prefer Columbian or Victorian? Tea, that is.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  ...You’re right back to your old self.
[name="Zima"]  Whatever, I can’t drink it anyway.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  It’s how I was raised. I must show my most refined side at all times.
[name="Natalya"]  Sugar?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  ...Yeah.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Sorry, you can’t sweeten this kind of tea. Drink it straight up, please.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  You suck.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Hmph.
[name="Zima"]  Look, Natalya, I don’t know how I’m supposed to cheer you up. And anyway I really don’t wanna.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Oh? Not only do you not hate me, you want to comfort me?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Shut up.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Alright, alright.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  I hate trying to comfort people. Every time I try, I screw everything up.
[name="Zima"]  All I can do is tell you what I’m thinking.
[name="Zima"]  You asked me a minute ago if I was gonna keep on living as Zima.
[name="Zima"]  The answer is yes.
[name="Zima"]  My mom and dad died in Chernobog. There’s nothing for me to go back to. I don’t wanna go back to Ursus. So that’s that.
[name="Zima"]  I think I should be able to understand your pain or whatever, but I really don’t.
[name="Zima"]  At first, I thought you wanted to justify yourself. Punks talk like that when they want to sucker-punch me while I’m distracted. But you seem legit sad. Why?
[name="Zima"]  Those noble shitstains wouldn’t have been any better off without you. And you’re not the one who turned them into dickheads anyway. You didn’t make all that happen.
[name="Zima"]  It was actually me...
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  You?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Nothing, forget it. But if I was one of those nobles, I might’ve liked having a leader like you. Same way Istina chose me.
[name="Zima"]  You did what you could.
[name="Zima"]  I only hate you because you were my enemy before you weren’t. Also I hate nobles. That’s all.
[name="Zima"]  Oh, and I have nightmares, and the nightmares make me puke, and then I can’t sleep because I’m sad.
[name="Zima"]  But doing what you can to survive isn’t bad.
[name="Zima"]  And I don’t think it was bad to let you live.
[name="Zima"]  I think you’re a shithead. But I know, without you, just relying on Anna, we never would’ve survived those next couple weeks.
[name="Zima"]  Just go for a run. Eat when you’re hungry. Sleep when you’re tired. Better than sitting around moping.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  ...Welp.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  What are you doing?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Ahahahahaha.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  What’s making you laugh like that? Jeez, you’re tearing up.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Nothing. It’s just, this is why it’s nice to chat with you.
[name="Natalya"]  If it were Anna and me, we’d be bawling our eyes out over each other by now.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  She doesn’t like you either, don’t forget.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  I know. Pfft. Hahaha! I know.
[name="Natalya"]  Listen, Sonya.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  What are you doing?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  I want you to know, you completely failed to address my problem.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  I’m way too lazy to care.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  And I think there’s nothing I could do to help with yours.
[name="Natalya"]  But you were right on one point: we survived.
[name="Natalya"]  Do you think we can make it out?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Huh?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  The circle beneath our feet, the night, the maze, our minds, our thoughts, the abyss.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Could you use like, real words?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Right, right. Operators all have codenames, right? If I were to become an operator, what should my codename be?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  How should I know? Anna picked mine.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Okay. What do you think of Rosa?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  Ursine for \"dew?\"
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Yes, like morning dew. Can you call me \"Rosa?\"
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1",name2="char_115_headbr_9",focus=2)]
[name="Zima"]  O...kay?
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1")]
[name="Rosa"]  It’s settled. If I’m to become an operator, they’ll call me Rosa.
