Why do I want to join the Armorless Union?
What a weird question. This is your organization, old man. What's there to explain?
So, does this count as my interview? I heard all the companies around town do stuff like this now. Are we going to interview every new recruit from now on? Should I start calling you 'Boss'?
Stop being such a pain in the ass.
The way I see it, there's no difference between a hitman agency and any other business. Show up to work, do some overtime, then make that someone else's problem.
If I had to give you a reason, then it's probably for the extra cash. Sure as hell beats what I make from hunting fowlbeasts.
It's the same stuff anyways—you aim, you shoot. Of course the higher paying job's gonna motivate you more.
Isn't that right, boss? After all, everyone just wants to live the good life.

The Armorless Union's Lazurite rank. How about it? Sounds pretty powerful, doesn't it?
Honestly, the pay isn't half-bad either. In a way, it's not too different from being a competition knight. You earn your keep by putting your life on the line.
You don't get paid the big bucks without taking a few risks, right?
That said, after more than a decade in the business, it's time to hang up the hat.
'Quit while you're ahead.' The simplest truth to live by. Why swim against the current of the era? There are more stable sources of income, so why burn your life away?

He lifts his hands to pat his cheeks while aimlessly looking out at the bright city lights.
The most recent news highlights are being broadcast on the big screen on the side of a skyscraper.
All the other screens dotting the cityscape, large and small, play roughly the same thing, their clashing noises and flashing lights enough to make one a bit dizzy.
[name="Television"]The Blood Knight was attacked by unknown assailants in his secluded countryside home. There were traces of an intense struggle, and it has been confirmed that the blood left at the scene belongs to the former champion himself.
[name="Television"]The bodies of the attackers were also found at the scene.
[name="Television"]Experts have commented that it is highly unlikely that the Blood Knight survived such a fierce battle, which is consistent with the large quantities of blood found.
[name="Television"]The leading theory at the moment is that our former champion, weakened after his battle with the Radiant Knight, exhausted the last of his strength and passed away along with his assailants.
[name="Television"]For more information, please stay tuned to our follow-up program! The truth behind the attack on the Blood Knight!

Later, the old man told me that he's a Darksteel, and that I might be cut out to become a Lazurite.
He may have been as cold and shady as his rank, but I don't think there's anything particularly blue about me. Oh, not that I'm trying to argue with you, boss. Lazurite suits me just fine.
When the old man picked me up—well, I won't say that, since I was doing perfectly fine by myself and didn't need to be 'picked up.'
Basically, I had just hunted two fowlbeasts at the time. Scalded off the plumage, bled them out, and had them ready for eating after some time over the fire pit.
They came out pretty good, and the old man ate a fowlbeast and a half all by himself. Left me with two heads, a pair of claws, and one leg.
After he finished, he started talking like one of those high-and-mighty folks out of the storybooks:
Even without a teacher or any tools, you're still able to hunt these slippery fowlbeasts. They can be difficult even for experienced hunters your age. You've got a natural talent.
How about it, child? Want to live the good life?
—Of course. How could I not?

This whole deal with pawning my life off to them... The more time passes, the more I see things clearly.
The knights are commodities they hoard inside their warehouses. The assassins are weapons they wield. And what of public opinion? It's their best tool for manipulation, and they've studied it thoroughly.
Money and power. In Kazimierz, these two things are often inextricably linked.
Hey, I'm not saying you have to become a tycoon or anything, but look, if you want to live a better life, you have to rub shoulders with those people.
Most people are fine climbing over others, one rung at a time. But when will you ever be free from someone else's control?
So just don't think about it too much. If you're privileged enough, just try to live a better, more comfortable life.

[name="Joel"]Haha, if something happens to me, you'd inherit everything I own anyway, just from our legal status.
[name="Donna"]Good point. Might as well speed up the process then.
[name="Joel"]How cruel. Anyway, enough of that. After I tie up some loose ends, how about we go on that vacation I suggested? Give it a thought, alright?
[name="Joel"]Wherever you decide to go, why not make it a team effort?
