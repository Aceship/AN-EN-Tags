We spend our entire lives flying. Has anyone ever stopped to wonder where we will end up?
The humid breeze from back home, and the saline taste it leaves in the mouth.
The scorching sun, the unbearably high temperatures, the marks the hustle and bustle leave behind on the skin, and the air currents that gather in the open, spacious city.
I’ve experienced it. I’ve experienced it all.

[name="Purestream"]  Okay, it’s up to you to let everybody else know, Mr. Elysium!
[name="Purestream"]  I’ve already talked to the Logistics Department about the ingredients we need, and I’ll figure out the menu with FEater.
[name="Purestream"]  We should be able to make most homemade fare ourselves, but we’ll need help with the more complicated dishes...
[name="Purestream"]  Oh, right! Leizi said she could help us write the invitations. Her handwriting is pretty, and her stroke movements are so beautiful and swift. Just watching her write makes me want to learn calligraphy!
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Well, you certainly have everything in order. I didn’t expect Miss Leizi to offer her help.
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  We need to contact the Yen and Lungmen operators on this list who are currently out in the field, correct? Just leave it to me. I’ll get every last one of them! 
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Purestream"]  I’m so glad you’re helping us, Mr. Elysium.
[name="Purestream"]  I didn’t expect there to be so many people from the old country here at Rhodes Island. Hehe, I really love that feeling of everyone coming together. It makes everything so lively, having so many people in one place. 
[name="Purestream"]  I wonder if the people out there right now will make it back on time, though... I really hope they do... Hm, I guess it’s probably going to be difficult, but there’s always a chance!
[name="Purestream"]  Oh, of course, we welcome everyone! Would you like to join us, Mr. Elysium? You can bring your friends with you, too. The more the merrier! 
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Really? That’s wonderful. I’ll bring as many as I can. This is an opportunity not to be missed.

[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#10", focus=1)]
[name="Purestream"]  Eh? Wait a minute, why would Miss Andreana do something like that on the deck? She doesn’t seem like the kind of person who would do that... 
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#2", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=1)]
[name="Purestream"]  Eh, really? I can see Dr. Kal'tsit being strict. She still is. But how about everyone else? How was Miss Closure? And what about Amiya?   
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#2", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Well, you know how Dr. Kal'tsit is. As for Miss Closure, since she was always busy, we rarely ever got a glimpse of her. She only slowed down a little after she got everything on the ship in order, before getting busy again with her robots. 
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#2", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#9", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Hm... Let’s see. It was about two years ago when I first got here.
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#2", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Amiya was still a kid back then. She was a bit shorter, like a sprout.

[name="Elysium"]  Haha, I have to say. She still isn’t quite an adult, even though her expression is a lot different now.

[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#2", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=2)]
[name="Thorns"]  I believe the Doctor joined shortly before we did. 
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=1)]
[name="Absinthe"]  Really? But I thought the Doctor was one of the founders of Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#8", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Well... that’s a tough question to answer.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#9", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  To tell you the truth, I’m not entirely sure what happened myself. I think something happened to the Doctor before I got here, and not many people know about it. The captain wouldn’t tell me about it, either.
[name="Elysium"]  Anyway, I never met the Doctor until everything that went down in Lungmen. Ace certainly did raise the topic from time to time, though. 
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  In any case, I’d say the way things are now isn’t too bad. Amiya, Dr. Kal'tsit, and the Doctor all get along with each other, and we’re bringing in more and more operators. Things are going to get even busier here. 
[name="Elysium"]  From that point of view, I think I made the right decision when I decided to stay. I’ve had my fill of gloomy, boring places.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  I may not be a Messenger, but I still get the chance to travel to different places, see different sights, and have a place to call home. That’s more than enough for me.

[name="Elysium"]  Oh, don’t look like that. It’s not as if I have any painful memories of the place, but... yeah, Iberia was pretty boring for me.
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#6", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Purestream"]  Even though it’s your homeland...?
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#6", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#8", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Yeah, it’s boring. It’s depressing to no end. 
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#6", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#9", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  I couldn’t live there, and so I left. That’s all there is to it. Aside from that, I guess it wasn’t so bad. 
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#9", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=2)]
[name="Thorns"]  That’s what you think.
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#9", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Thorns"]  To us Ægirians, Iberia isn’t a very friendly place.
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#6", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Oh... I’ve heard a little about that, but I don’t know much about it. There weren’t a lot of Ægirians where I lived, after all.
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#6", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=2)]
[name="Thorns"]  Most Ægirians lived on the streets in the city outskirts or stuck it out near the blockade line until the Inquisition went after them. Very few of us were lucky enough to live a peaceful life. 
[name="Thorns"]  The Inquisition rounded up a lot of people. People that they deemed threats, and rightfully so.
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#9", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  ......
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#6", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=1)]
[name="Purestream"]  Um, are you sure?
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#6", name2="char_405_absin_4", focus=2)]
[name="Absinthe"]  That sounds kinda scary. If I remember correctly, you’re an Ægirian too, aren’t you, Purestream? 
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_405_absin_4", focus=1)]
[stopmusic(fadetime=3)]
[name="Purestream"]  Yeah, but there are people of all races in Yen, so no one seemed to mind. I haven’t heard of Ægirians being barred from any official positions, either. Everyone’s equal.
[playMusic(intro="$warm_intro", key="$warm_loop", volume=0.4)]
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#9", focus=1)]
[name="Purestream"]  Now that I think about it, Rhodes Island doesn’t care much about races, either. When I first got here, everyone really took good care of me. Just like Mr. Elysium! He helped me out on my first field mission!
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#3", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#9", focus=1)]
[name="Absinthe"]  Me too. On my last mission, some enemies got the drop on me. It’s all thanks to Mr. Elysium that I’m still here... Thank you very much. 
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#3", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#11", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Oh, no need to thank me. I get reassigned to different teams pretty often. We’re all teammates, so we should help each other out.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#11", focus=1)]
[name="Absinthe"]  Even so, I must still thank you for your kindness.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Absinthe, you’re always so stubborn when it comes to these things. I have way too many people around me like that... 
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=2)]
[name="Thorns"]  Such as that captain of yours?
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#4", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  Yes, she’s one of those people, but have you ever noticed you’re very stubborn yourself?
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#3", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Purestream"]  The captain doesn’t talk much, but she looks so cool... and I’m a little embarrassed to say this, but I’m actually a little scared of her.
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#3", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  I get it, I get it. She does look very scary.
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#3", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  But, you know, she just looks scary and doesn’t try to talk to others much. She’s actually very easy to talk to.
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#3", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  The next time you see her, maybe you should try saying hi to her. She may not look it, but it’ll make her really happy. I guarantee it.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#3", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Absinthe"]  It sounds like you two really get along.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#3", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#11", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Well, I guess we kind of do... After all, she was the one who saved my life.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#3", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Besides, she can’t get by without my help. If it wasn’t for that, I would’ve been a Messenger, traveling all around the world right now.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#3", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Haha, being popular has its own set of problems.
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#2", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=2)]
[name="Thorns"]  I seem to remember she’s on a solo mission right now?
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#2", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Thorns"]  And you’re saying she can’t get by without your help?
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#10", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  ...This mission’s different! Only she alone could handle such an infiltration mission. I’d just blow her cover. 
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  I don’t think she has ever teamed up with anyone before me, right? It was pretty terrible at first. She even used to beat me up just because she thought I was annoying. Don’t you think that’s cruel? 
[name="Elysium"]  Her Arts are really something else. I took a single blow and it knocked me out of my senses so terribly that I didn’t even know how to get home. It took me a while until I remembered who I was!
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#2", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=1)]
[name="Absinthe"]  It affected your consciousness... and memories? I didn’t know Arts could be so dangerous. 
[name="Absinthe"]  And that someone here at Rhodes Island has Arts like that...
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#2", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Uh, yeah, it’s not something we talk about often. It’s technically classified information, so don’t tell anyone else, okay? 
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#2", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Anyway, you should try to be more casual. We all get along with each other here. If there’s anything you don’t understand, come find me. I’ll be happy to help you.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#2", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Thorns"]  More or less what he just said.
[name="Thorns"]  You don’t need to force yourself, though. Just go on at your own pace. Anyone will be happy to help you should you run into any problems.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_4#3", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Absinthe"]  ...Thanks.
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#5", name2="char_405_absin_4#3", focus=1)]
[name="Purestream"]  Yep, that’s right. Don’t push yourself too hard! 
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_405_absin_4#3", focus=1)]
[name="Purestream"]  Oh, perfect! Sinthe, why don’t you come to our party? You two as well, Mr. Elysium, Mr. Thorns. I’ll be making lots of food from back home! 
[name="Purestream"]  The festival only happens once a year. Be sure to eat your fill!
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Elysium"]  Well! That certainly gives me something to look forward to! 
[Character(name="char_385_finlpp#5", name2="char_401_elysm_na_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Purestream"]  Hehe, and do look forward to it. I promise you won’t be disappointed~!

[name="Thorns"]  A city in gray, drab colors. Depressing. Boring. Is that all?   
[name="Thorns"]  Is that how you see that place?
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#5", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1", focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  Well... my situation isn’t quite like yours.
[name="Elysium"]  I really don’t have much to say about that place. It was a simple and boring place to me, and that really is it for me.
[name="Elysium"]  Besides, I couldn’t possibly have gone into the details. One of them is still a child.

[name="Elysium"]  Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten.
[name="Elysium"]  The girl is still a student, and she’s in a pretty cheerful mood because of the festival coming up. Let’s not dampen her spirits.
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#9", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Elysium"]  Home... huh? I wonder what it’s like now. 
[name="Elysium"]  I wonder if it’s still packed with buildings, and the wind is still so humid, with that salty scent to it? Are the streets there still empty, and everyone there’s as quiet as they’ve always been? 
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#9", name2="char_293_thorns_n_1#4", focus=2)]

[name="Elysium"]  Haha, you’re right.
[name="Elysium"]  Tell me, brother, do you think we’ll ever have a chance to go back, having run away from that place?
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#8")]
[name="Elysium"]  I don’t think I want to go back.
[Character(name="char_401_elysm_na_1#9")]
