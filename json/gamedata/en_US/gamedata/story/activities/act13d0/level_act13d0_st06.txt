[name="Performer B"]  Together, we left our birthplace. Together, we came of age. We were relatives of different blood. We ate as one, lived as one, yet saw not the same ending. 
[name="Performer B"]  It has been an eternity since I have spoken to you. Since the candle melted away, since my blood dripped with the candle upon the stage, since then have we not spoken.
[name="Performer C"]  We differ from you. A performer unable to know the true taste of art is but a failed, rejected article. Only the love. None of the gift.
[name="Performer C"]  While some throw themselves upon the flame, some fly away.
[name="Performer B"]  And some yet stay there in the bygone past. In that night. There the sound of singing arises, and never ceases.

[name="Human Resources Operator"]  Circling back to that, we've got a decent amount of operators' files in incomplete states. In general, standard protocol for small questions is we'd find the person themselves and ask directly.
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  But Operator Phantom's kind of tricky in this regard... I'm gonna put it straight. We can barely figure out where he is.
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_388_mint_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mint"]  Is he not on the ship right now?
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_388_mint_1",focus=1)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  No. Our mission records say he's not out in the field for anything.
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  Operator Phantom seems to be deliberately avoiding people. Add in his Arts, and we've had our work cut out finding him.
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  We could lie in wait in places, or ask Miss Closure for help... but we just can't spare a single person and waiting's not an option, and as for the latter, well, mm...
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  I heard he caused some trouble when he joined us and now Miss Closure's... pissed off with him.
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  So we'd probably be telling her 'this is your chance to give him a public execution,' right? It's hard to even guess what would happen afterwards. 
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_388_mint_1#5",focus=2)]

[name="Mint"]  Are Mr. Phantom's Originium Arts similar to Mr. Ethan's? Or... um, waitletmelookatthemanual. Right! Like Miss Manticore's? 
[name="Mint"]  She has the ability to hide where she is too, doesn't she?
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_388_mint_1",focus=1)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  Yep. I remember when she signed on. It was just as much of an effort back then to get her records filled out.

[name="Human Resources Operator"]  But if you're going to lie about the most basic things, then that's a completely different matter!
