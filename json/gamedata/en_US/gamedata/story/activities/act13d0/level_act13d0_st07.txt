[name="Suzuran"]Until one day, her husband went missing.

[name="Suzuran"]She went home and cried under the willow tree her husband had planted himself.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1")]
[name="Suzuran"]A wise elder in the village saw Dusk Beauty weeping everyday and came up with an idea.
[name="Suzuran"]The old man said—
[name="Suzuran"]*Cough* *cough*... Mhmm.

[CameraShake(xstrength=0, ystrength=0, vibrato=0, randomness=0,duration=1)]
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1")]
[name="Suzuran"]Dusk Beauty agreed with the wise elder's suggestion, and decided to leave the town and head to the mountain at the edge of the land.
[name="Suzuran"]This mountain, the tallest of them all, was called Mount T'ien by the people of Yen.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1#4",name2="char_185_frncat_1",focus=1)]
[name="Popukar"]That sounds so cool.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1")]
[name="Suzuran"]The meaning of Mount Sky is 'a mountain as tall as the skies.' There is no mountain taller than it in all of Yen. 
[name="Suzuran"]After much tribulation, Dusk Beauty reached the mountain peak and looked out over the vast land. But after three days and three nights, even as her eyes reddened from the strain, there was no sign of her husband.
[name="Suzuran"]With years of her effort ending up fruitless, Dusk Beauty could not help but weep, and her tears flowing down the mountain formed a river.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1",name2="char_185_frncat_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mousse"]How sad...
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1")]

[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1")]
[name="Suzuran"]The surging tears shocked the gods within the mountains. They couldn't believe the river which had appeared out of nowhere.
[name="Suzuran"]Upon seeing the source of the river, they were even more surprised. The gods decided to send their leader, the god of Mount Sky, to talk with the girl.
[name="Suzuran"]The kind god listened to Dusk Beauty's story and pitied her. Thus, the god of Mount Sky said:
[name="Suzuran"]'Lofty heights of Mount Sky, lie yet dwarfed by the twin moons. Ascend thee to the moons, and thy husband shall thee find soon.' 
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1",name2="char_185_frncat_1",focus=1)]
[name="Popukar"]Huh?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1")]
[name="Suzuran"]Oh, sorry. It's sort of poetic and old-tymey, isn't it? Let me explain.
[name="Suzuran"]It means that even though the mountain was very tall, its height could not compare to the twin moons in the sky. So, if she could fly to the moons, she would definitely be able to find her husband.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1#2",name2="char_185_frncat_1",focus=1)]
[name="Popukar"]Oh.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1")]
[name="Suzuran"]Dusk Beauty accepted the mountain god's suggestion, and asked for help. After the gods discussed it, they taught her a way...
[name="Suzuran"]One night, everyone was going about their business as usual, when suddenly, a bright light rose from the western mountains and rushed towards the moon.
[name="Suzuran"]This light became brighter and brighter, brighter and brighter, and at one point it even became brighter than the moon.
[name="Suzuran"]Finally, this light landed on the moon, and a big and brilliant sparkle rose out of it. The night sky grew bright, and it was hard to even see the stars.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1",name2="char_185_frncat_1",focus=1)]
[name="Popukar"](Whisper) Mousse, can we see fireworks like that now?! 
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1",name2="char_185_frncat_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mousse"](Whisper) Of course not!
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1")]
[name="Suzuran"]Upon seeing such a thing, everyone panicked, thinking it meant something terrible.
[name="Suzuran"]But the elder recalled the story of Dusk Beauty and told everyone this meant she had found her husband. He told them not to be afraid, and to celebrate instead.
[name="Suzuran"]The people were convinced, so they brought out their wine and food, and celebrated the departure of Dusk Beauty.
[name="Suzuran"]From then on, everyone would bring food and gather together to feast once a year. They put the foods that Dusk Beauty liked on an altar.
[name="Suzuran"]They did it every year, without fail.
[name="Suzuran"]As time passed, it became a traditional festival.
[name="Suzuran"]Even after Dusk Beauty left, the river continued to flow down from Mount Sky, so the people decided to name the river after her, calling it the Dusk River.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#5")]
[name="Suzuran"]Later on, the village slowly developed into a city. The edge of the city was next to the Dusk River, so naturally the city was called Dusk City.

[name="Suzuran"]The woman asked the old man to accept the treasures, and to help her look for a husband. The treasures would be a gift to the old man in return.

[name="Suzuran"]The woman never asked for the same item twice, but no one was able to fulfill her requests.
[name="Suzuran"]'As long as you can bring me one treasure, I will become your wife.'

[name="Suzuran"]She would marry whoever brought her the treasure first.
[name="Suzuran"]Just as the third brother was to listen to his request, the woman fell silent.
[name="Suzuran"]Leaving the old man's house, the two brothers found the requests extraordinarily difficult and impossible to complete.

[name="Suzuran"]With their treasures in hand, the two brothers led armies that clashed against each other.
[name="Suzuran"]The entire village became a battlefield, and with both sides going on the offensive, they both suffered major losses.
[name="Suzuran"]Many of the villagers tried to hide or escape. Refusing to leave their piles of riches, the old couple ended up killed along with the rest of the villagers who stayed behind.

[name="Suzuran"]But he had no way to travel to heaven, and the fairy taunted him from the sky.

[name="Mousse"]When they were born, the most respected caster in the country came to congratulate the king on the birth of the prince and princess, and offered a prophecy:
[name="Mousse"]'With the guidance of the divine light, both will have bright futures.' 
[name="Mousse"]The king was extremely pleased and bequeathed upon the caster many treasures and riches. But when he asked the caster to explain the prophecy, he fell silent and left the castle instead.
[name="Mousse"]Years later, the prince and princess were grown, but the wise king had fallen ill with a terrible sickness and was bedridden. The doctors said it was a terminal illness, and that only the Divine Originium could save the king.
[name="Mousse"]All the warriors from across the land set out to search for the Originium, including the prince and princess, disguised as adventurers.
[name="Mousse"]They had to join the quest to save their father.
