Qiubai walks at a brisk pace, and the old man quickens his steps to catch up, ending the conversation.
The sky gradually turns dark. It may be strange to ordinary folk, but Jianghu adventurers prefer to travel at night, using the darkness to their advantage.
The newly raised grave at the entrance of the village is stubby and inconspicuous, hardly visible in the twilight.

Three years later, Fang Xiaoshi stands once again before the temple. This time there are no explosives, and the man beside him is even older.
The wall he blew up has already been rebuilt and the statue of the mountain digger repaired, but the craftsmanship is a little lacking, and upon seeing this slightly amusing sight Fang Xiaoshi carelessly lets out a laugh.
There are several broken tiles on the floor, with bugs in the still-damaged ceiling forming layers and layers of webbing that blends into the wood.
Perhaps it is too dark to be certain, but he can't figure out if the temple was impossible to renovate, or if it was successfully repaired but has gradually returned to a dilapidated state.
