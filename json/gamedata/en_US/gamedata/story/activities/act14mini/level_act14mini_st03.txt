The people of this settlement have been here for generations, begging the mountain to grant them a living.
The wild fruits are poisonous before they ripen while the beasts are cunning and vicious. One could easily lose one's life to carelessness, but there is no other source of food.
The rain flows through the rocky crevices, turning yellow by the time it reaches the foot of the mountain. But there is no other source of water.
He sharpens a stone's edge, breaks some vines and ties the rock to a slender tree trunk.
Now he has a hoe.
He finds a small patch of relatively moist and flat ground at the foot of the mountain, and digs out ridges with his hoe. He plants seeds he has collected over time.
Now he has a plot of arable land.
This small piece of land cannot feed everyone, but if the mountain weren't there...
It is tall enough to pierce the clouds, it spans wider than the eye can see. With sharp peaks and drops this way and that, it makes an imposing obstacle.
The wind itself cannot freely pass, let alone men. It's as if the mountain before them is draining their very vitality.

He works and rests at the foot of the mountain. Armed with just hoe and pan, he would wake, dig, sleep, repeat.
Six months pass and the mountain shows little more than a few shallow scars. But the spectating villagers put down the fruit and pulp in their hands.
More and more join the excavators. With more hoes at work, the arable land expands.
The cycle of crushing rock and reclaiming soil continues day after day, night after night.

[name="Qiubai"]Don't worry. I won't stand in your way, let alone expose your plans. Otherwise, I would have sent Fang Xiaoshi to the authorities long ago, instead of bringing him back here.
[name="Qiubai"]But since I was the one who brought him back, I have to ensure his safety. I can't see him come to harm, or it would be as if I hurt him myself.
[name="Qiubai"]I won't be leaving the village for now.
