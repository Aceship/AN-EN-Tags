[name="Clan Elder"]I know how deeply I've sinned, which is why I do not dare beg forgiveness from the ancestors. All I can do, all I can do is...

The old man gathers the pieces of the dismantled explosives in front of him.
After kneeling for so long, he has nearly lost all sensation in his legs, and he falls to the ground again. The coldness pours into his forehead, and he feels as if he cannot stand back up, able to do nothing but prostrate himself lower and lower.
......
The two souls before him seem to be causing quite the uproar, but the mountain excavator does not pay them any heed.
A few pieces of mud have peeled off the eye sockets of the clay sculpture, and it is difficult to tell if its sight was fixed on the ruined beams of the temple or the desolate land just outside it.
Clear are the clouds and warm is the breeze, just in time for Chunfen.

[name="Qiubai"]You asked me about my life story before, didn't you? Maybe this would be the right time to tell you.
[name="Qiubai"]Back when the army broke through the river fort at Jiangqi, my father and a number of the other bandits were put to death, but I managed to escape. To the government, I am also a person without a name.
[name="Qiubai"]There are many, many nameless people in this land. Just like you, just like me, just like the boy who nearly became 'Fang Xiaoshi.'
[name="Qiubai"]A name is certainly important, but it's more important for you to understand the meaning behind that name.
[name="Qiubai"]If you want to stand up and fight injustice, does it really matter what you are called? Sometimes, you'll make bigger waves and accomplish more things without a name.
[name="Qiubai"]Only by letting go of meaningless obsessions can we truly recognize what we are meant to do.
[name="Qiubai"]I don't expect you to understand my words right now. I have my own things to do, so I can't take care of you forever. But, if you truly want to learn kung fu, I can teach you for now.
[name="Qiubai"]When you're capable enough to establish yourself, or figure things out on your own, or find something else worth living for, you're free to leave at any time.
[name="Qiubai"]But, know that there are many who succumb to evil and cause calamity after acquiring power. If you become a man like that, I <i>will</i> kill you.
......
[name="Qiubai"]Alright. I'll teach you another saying we have among jianghu martial artists. It pretty much means the same thing as 'there's always next time.'
......
