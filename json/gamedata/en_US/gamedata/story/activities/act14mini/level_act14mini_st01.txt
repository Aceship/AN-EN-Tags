One mount connects to the next, the peak of one mountain connected to the foot of another. There is no end in sight, no road to traverse.

On the other side of the cliff, a gray trail winds along the terrain and extends all the way to edge of the horizon, quite eye-catching in contrast to the barrens.
'Chidao,' a Yanese infrastructure project for Catastrophe avoidance, resource transportation, and aiding people living in remote areas.
Tens of thousands of such roads interconnect more than a hundred nomadic cities across the country's endless wilderness.
It stretches across wild, untamed mountains and erects bridges over low-lying areas. The supply stations set up along the roads are like neatly-sectioned bamboo nodes, bringing life to every place they reach.
If it can be said that the gods abandoned this barren land, then humans are the ones who once again laid out its veins.
All under heaven is strife, but humanity does what it can.

In the places that have not yet been plowed, clumps of soil are packed together tighter and tighter, the heads of wheat from the last crop still droop.
