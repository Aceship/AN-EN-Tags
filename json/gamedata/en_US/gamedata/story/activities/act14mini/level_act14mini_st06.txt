The Messenger's day begins before sunrise, at the hour when starlight begins to give way to dawn.
In remote regions like this, the delivery of parcels, letters, even simple messages, requires no ordinary effort.
Messengers embark on long journeys into the wilds, facing a multitude of risks and challenges. This Messenger, for instance, walks a dozen li every day—

[name="Messenger"]It was raining, and the dirt on the slopes started to come lose. Rocks came rolling down the slope...
Was your infection—
[name="Messenger"]No, no.
[name="Messenger"]I saw a big rock that was about to fall onto the parcels. I don't know what I was thinking in the heat of the moment, so I tried to knock it away with my horns...
[name="Messenger"]That's how I broke my left horn.
Pffft––
[name="Messenger"]Are you laughing?
S-Sorry, I didn't mean to—
[name="Messenger"]Whatever. Still better than the long look on your face you've been having.
[name="Messenger"]I find it funny too. I still carry the broken horn with me, to remind myself not to rush on rainy nights.
[name="Messenger"]And maybe I could find a doctor to put it back, if I get the chance.
[name="Messenger"]I've done a lot of dumb things and seen a lot of interesting sights on my deliveries.
[name="Messenger"]But I'm usually by myself, and there's no one to tell my stories to.

The less-than-amicable parting with the interviewee is yet another unexpected challenge. But I have to keep going.
The argument made me reflect and realize that one cannot rely on books alone to learn about life. My understanding of 'hardship' remains shallow.
Life is a journey with predetermined starting and ending points, a journey that one stumbles through, searching for a path.
The paths may differ, but we all fight against the tides of fate and struggle against the monsters of reality for the sake of the scenery we cling to.
These struggles are a source of hardship, yet they are also noble.
I may have had misfortune, but never misery. This realization has set my mind at ease.
I shall go forward and keep walking.
I should apologize to the Messenger, if I see her.
Maybe I'd better do it now.
Hello, Miss Messenger.
I don't have a pen or paper with me, so all I can do is record my apology this way.
I'm sorry for offending you.
I wanted to explain that I didn't mean to look down on anyone; I just wanted to do what I can, to do something meaningful, just like you.
I really respect your commitment and courage.
I haven't been able to live 'authentically' like you do, but thanks to you, I'm a little closer to 'authentic'.
Once again, I apologize for offending you, and for my lack of understanding.
I hope you will see this apology, informal as it is, someday.
Yours sincerely—
