A fowlbeast's calls echo through the wilderness, and a fresh sun peeks out from the horizon.
The sun's color changes from day to day. Yesterday, it was shining brightly, but today it glows weakly. A few sparse rays of lights leak from the heavy clouds, coating the village in a layer of ashen gray.
An elderly man sits in a wheelchair, staring blankly at the shed in front of him.
He was instructed to call for help if he heard anything or saw someone trying to escape.
Being so old and needing help to get around, there is not much for him to do.
He was told the village has an important project, and once it's completed, everyone will be able to live a comfortable life.
In order to complete the project, he must not let the one inside escape.
He is old, but he can still offer some form of assistance, to help the village.
[StopSound(channel="bd", fadetime=2)]
The morning breeze picks up, sending the blanket from his shoulders about a meter behind him.
He wants to call for help, but worries that he shouldn't alarm the group over such a minor thing. He should only cry out over the task entrusted to him.
Someone picks up the blanket, dusts it off and drapes it over his shoulders.

Facing rebels, bandits, seasoned generals, kung fu masters... whether in a fight or a competition, the way she unsheathed her sword was always more natural and unreserved than the action she just took.

[name="Mulberry"]Northwestern Yan has always been a dry, mountainous region; extra dry these past two years. Rainfalls have been concentrated in spring and summer, and a nearby Catastrophe has also exacerbated the climate change.
[name="Mulberry"]Vegetation is sparse and difficult to plant. These are mostly barren mountains with inhospitable soil and rock. What fertility the soil has is only getting worse. Coupled with intense bursts of rainfall, conditions are perfect for natural mudslides.

[name="Mulberry"]Hmm...
[name="Mulberry"]When I was interning at 'Chun-qian', we worked with Chidao engineering teams on scouting missions, assessments, and rescue operations.
