It was not fitted with a weapon, instead its only designated function was to provide timely treatment for Operators on the battlefield. \nMedicine that has undergone several rounds of testing by the Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical Team can be assembled into the drone's kits in a variety of ways. The drone can use aerosolized medicine, it can spray, it can inject, and it can simulate a medic's treatment wand. It can switch between these modes depending on the needs of the terrain and the environment, and the specific situation of the Operator in need of healing. \nHowever, this medical drone is still in its experimental stages. Because it needs to be lightweight and convenient, it needs to be a kind of throwaway and relatively fragile low-value target. Additionally, in areas with strong signal interference and complex terrain, its efficiency will be affected to a certain degree. \nEven so, it still provides Rhodes Island Operators with quality treatment. Better still, this is only the first gift that Silence has brought to Rhodes Island.",

Judging by Ifrit's current symptoms, we can at least tell that the treatment was unsuccessful.\nAs one of the Rhodes Island medical team's more demanding patients, Ifrit primarily receives care from Silence. This is consistent with information currently available from their time at Rhine Lab. Even after coming to Rhodes Island, the two have maintained the close relationship they built when they were both at the other company. \nIn terms of personality, Ifrit is a bit... immature. She acts like a 6-10 year old and is rebellious, impetuous, overconfident most of the time, even bordering on egotistical. She is extremely impulsive, ready to act the second an idea pops into her mind, no matter how dangerous it might be.\nOn the other hand, the outstanding form her Originium Arts take must be supported. Rhine Lab even created a flame-casting wand device to complement her talent. This gift pushed Ifrit to show off her abilities with even more bombast. \nIn short, after daily observation, we can say that Ifrit is someone who easily gets caught up in her emotions. For now, she doesn't have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and she's quite immature. In an extreme environment such as a battlefield, her instincts push her to fight against and even annihilate all those who get in her way. As a result, even if she never intended to do so, she has saved many lives.",

However, the structure of her horns and her tail are quite different from typical Sarkaz. Even though current research on the Sarkaz and their traits is incomplete, at least compared to the other Sarkaz present at Rhodes Island, Ifrit's characteristics are quite unique. \nThe Sarkaz race maintains particular talent for Originium Arts, and Ifrit's talent far exceeds that of most Sarkaz. \nAccording to these observations, it is probable that Ifrit's racial characteristics have undergone some superficial changes triggered by her Oripathy. It's also possible that the Originium presence in her circulatory system is interfering with test results. These changes are irreversible and have proven an unexpected obstacle to the medical team's investigation: they are unable to determine which type of Sarkaz Ifrit is. \nIn addition, Ifrit's medical records show that she suffers from chronic nerve pain and even occasional hallucinations. Records describe these hallucinations as enormous apparitions that are tremendously painful for her, or depictions of charred corpses and immolated animals, or close personal relations consumed by a sea of agonizing fire. The causes of these apparitions have proven elusive to all medical and mechanical analyses. It is possible that this ongoing torment is the source of her irascible character. \nIn summary, Ifrit is an Operator that needs close monitoring, even by Rhodes Island standards. Anyone who comes into contact with Ifrit should have a full understanding of all this Operator's basic information before their exchange takes place.\n[Classified Log]\nThis record exists because Ifrit's physiological structure has already become quite peculiar. \nShe was a Sarkaz, but whether she is still indeed Sarkaz, I am unsure...

She had no reservations about speaking bluntly, as if on the offensive.\nSaria is worried about Ifrit's continued growth and development. She candidly said that if the situation is not properly controlled, the results will not only destroy Rhodes Island, but will also set off other catastrophes. She said that the upper echelon of Rhine Lab is covering up the truth and that Silence is completely in the dark about all this.\nI expressed to her that we will continue monitoring Ifrit's infection and that we invite Saria to strengthen her cooperation with Rhodes Island on the condition that she sever all her political relationships.\nRhodes Island still needs to draw upon Saria's power to solve some problems, namely problems with some other Rhine Lab Operators. Also, we need to get ready to confront some Operators behind the scenes. Saria and I both agree on this.\nWe must be careful when dealing with the Rhine Lab issue. Amiya should be wary of some of the involved players' political inclinations.\n\n- Kal'tsit",

Currently only unconfirmed and less than reliable intelligence from Sargon spies indicate there is a group of people who house Originium Arts users with special abilities in this area. These individuals are using special training methods to kill Sargon aristocrats or operatives from other nations.\nBecause of Manticore's vague background, she has been designated a special type of Oripathy patient at Rhodes Island.

When Manticore went on the offensive, some of the Operators managed to defend against her attacks using their quick reaction times and combat experience, while Manticore managed to successfully attack the others. \nFeedback results: According to the explanations provided by the Operators, Manticore could not be captured using visual means.

LTD, is a controversial figure at Rhodes Island. \nWhatever the case, the other Operators have come to a consensus: SilverAsh is not an Operator who can be easily dispatched or controlled. \nSilverAsh and his employees work very closely with Rhodes Island, but there is no hierarchical relationship between them. \nWhether it is strategic planning or tactical command, many Operators find SilverAsh's prowess convincing. However, the more skeptical Operators familiar with political conspiracy and such machinations are wary of SilverAsh's intentions. \nAlthough SilverAsh truly cares about his younger sister, Cliffheart, who is being treated at Rhodes Island, he trusts Rhodes Island no more than Rhodes Island trusts him. \nPerhaps as the rumor says, what is really of interest to SilverAsh is the value of Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals itself, as well as the Doctor he regards as a competent rival... \n Dr. Kal'tsit is opposed to trying to make any further contact with SilverAsh. Though the Doctor may have other ideas.",

Despite the ruling, evidence at the scene pointed to foul play by political enemies of the Silverash clan. Perhaps because of the rapid decline of the Silverash Family, this matter was left unsettled. \nNaturally, the incident had a huge effect on young SilverAsh's life. But as SilverAsh was the scion of a wealthy family and not a weakling by any means, he never sank into despair, and even kept raising his two younger sisters until they were old enough to take care of themselves. \nThereafter, SilverAsh left Kjerag and headed to Victoria to receive a modern education, and let the Silverash family's political enemies divide up their legacy amongst themselves. The Three House Parliament of Kjerag was three houses in name only. \nThis state of affairs lasted until SilverAsh returned back to Kjerag. Upon his homecoming, the young master took upon himself the weighty responsibility of rebuilding his clan. \nNow according to Cliffheart's testimony, the SilverAsh who had returned was no longer the gentle and precocious youngster he used to be, who would grit his teeth and bear all that the world threw at him. \nThereafter, the Karlan Trade Company quickly rose to seize a monopoly in a large number of modern industries that had previously been banned in Kjerag. He exported goods and raw materials to other countries and imported modern industrial products. In doing so, he accumulated a vast amount of wealth in a very short time, and the success of his company restored the Silverash Family name to its position in the parliament. \nIn what may have been a series of plays by rival clans, SilverAsh's two younger sisters each suffered a turn of fortune that would have a huge impact on the Silverash family: Pramanix was christened a Karlan Saintess in a religious ritual, and Cliffheart was infected with Oripathy. \nRhodes Island tends to believe that these were acts of political opposition, but Cliffheart thinks that these events merely once again catalyzed SilverAsh's resolve. \nNow, no one knows what SilverAsh will do, just as no one knows the purpose behind his collaboration with Rhodes Island.",

The conflict between the Kjerag conservative faction and the reformist party have gotten more and more intense.\nOn the surface, the Karlan Trade Company is only concerned with foreign trade. However, its true owner is none other than Enciodes Silverash, head of the Silverash Family and opponent of the two conservative houses in the country's parliament.\nYou may also know him as SilverAsh, brother of Rhodes Island Operator Cliffheart.\nI am convinced that the Karlan Trade Company doesn't pay a cent to the government of Kjerag. It isn't a state-owned enterprise! Its operations and business are controlled entirely by SilverAsh himself!\nModern military equipment has passed from Raythean's hands, through the Karlan Trade Company's channels, and into Kjerag. The conservative faction doesn't even have any means of tracing the whereabouts of the goods.\nThe trade route has already been moved to the foot of the holy mountain, Karlan. The Vine-Bear Court has already used SilverAsh's sister, Saint Pramanix, as leverage to try to get the Silverash family to leave the Three House Parliament and hand over control of the valley and mining sites.\nThe troops the Karlan Trade Company sent to the training camps have already returned from Ascarat County in Victoria. Where are they now? The conservative Kjerag guards don't have any idea.\nSo what does Kjerag need most right now? We are reaching a boiling point here. What do they need?\n\nPressure from outside.\nJust a little bit of pressure from the outside. Just the tiniest little push...\nThe avalanche will bury all of Kjerag, including all of its conspiracies and all of the matters of the past.\n\nI admit that perhaps the Karlan Trade Company isn't hiding anything dangerous.\nEven so, should we really put ourselves in danger just because Cliffheart received a secret letter?\nAt the very least, Rhodes Island as a whole should not assume this magnitude of risk.\n\n--Dobermann, at the meeting 12 days before the incident at the mountain.",

The modern medical community saw it as a relic doomed to obsolescence.\nBut at Myrrh's insistence, Dr. Kal'tsit developed a special training course with modern technology specifically for her. The training has produced positive results. \nMyrrh quickly mastered a simplified pharmaceutical process and applied it to her work. While the result remains bitter, the remedies she offered have garnered positive feedback for their effectiveness. \nWith assistance from the convalescent home personnel, Operator Myrrh is now striving to overcome that final drawback of her medicine.",

Some accounts say that Kollam’s enemies suffered a weight several times that of their normal weapons when facing him in battle, finding themselves physically and mentally defeated. If they were lucky enough to survive, they were often maimed. But some referred to Kollam as an enlightened despot, saying that cuts from his blade drew no blood, and anyone wise enough to retreat would survive. \nHowever, some ancient texts claim that Kollam’s saber was destroyed in battle before he even succeeded to the throne, and that the weapon he later wielded was a fragile illusion born of his Arts. Such claims are inconsistent with Kollam’s subsequent performance in Sarkaz conflicts, and few can explain why Kollam would not recast his favorite sword under those circumstances. I speculate that Kollam did have the power to shape weapons with Arts, and this theory is centered on the throne. But that Kollam rarely used his Arts in that way, having once been an adventurer. \nOf course, it is written that after Kollam’s ascension, his saber gave off a greenish light, like a breath of flame. Kollam’s famous ferocity led to the blade being dubbed “Wrathful Cerulean Flame ”. \nMost of the Sarkaz legends have been lost in the ongoing ruination of Kazdel, which has tremendously impeded historical research. There have been recent calls from Sarkaz scholars to restore their history, but their own research has been poisoned by propagandistic efforts to paint a noble picture of the Sarkaz race. \n\n--Logos",

Vigna herself has also stepped up her own personal combat training in order to improve her mastery over the unique tool. \nVigna has never felt she could or would ever quit.

The huge fire rescue operation last winter more than proved Shaw's competence: When the irresponsible use of a space heater eventually set a whole building ablaze, Shaw made numerous incursions inside to rescue trapped victims, orchestrating a successful operation with zero casualties. That earned her a personal invite from Wei Yenwu, Chief Executive of Lungmen, as well as headlines in all the newspapers. \nWith Wei's and the L.G.D's support, Shaw was accepted into Rhodes Island for her expertise in fire safety and prevention. It was an obvious boon to the island, since most Operators have little to no knowledge of or training in firefighting. Shaw handily filled the gap. \nWhen Shaw had the chance to inspect the intricate passageways and firefighting equipment on the island, and after meeting certain Operators who wield fire Arts at will, she realized she faced a daunting task.",

The first seminar commenced with the notable absence of Dr. Kal'tsit, where Shaw presented materials and slides (including various scenes of major fires and warning signs). The presentation was short, thanks to Shaw's famously fast rate of speech, and the raucous applause made it clear the audience had no clue what she had intended to communicate to them. (Some confessed to hearing a voice but being unable to locate the speaker). \nThis disappointing outcome only kept Shaw down for about half a day, when she realized that there are many setbacks in life, depression is the death of passion.",

Some Operators from remote areas have seen similar weapons, but are not aware of the source. \nHolding this giant sword would be difficult for most people, but not for the unstoppable Skadi. Unlike most Operators who wear heavy armor to protect themselves, Skadi relies only on her sword and her strength. \nThe damage she inflicts is even more impressive than her imposing appearance. \nAfter returning from a mission with Skadi, other Operators often exaggerate her physical prowess in their reports, to the point where she sounds like a legendary monster. \nAlthough Skadi has little interest in debriefings, she humors the higher-ups anyway, typically complaining about how her teammates got in her way or that the rules of engagement are too constricting. \nSkadi excels at fighting large masses of enemies, but also tends to cause excessive property damage. This includes wrecked buildings, mangled fences, and once collapsing an entire fort. \nSkadi is very similar to another Operator, Specter. \nMuch like Specter, Skadi is not good with Originium. But for Skadi, taking down a target as quickly as possible is the most effective tactic. \nAll this taken together, Skadi is quite unstable. Although she is well-behaved, has followed orders, and completed her missions, she operates like an out-of-control freight train in combat and that should be restrained. \nStill, Rhodes Island may need a force of nature like Skadi for certain missions.",

They are also perplexed by her propensity to abandon the squad and complete missions by herself. \nSome Operators suggest talking to her and helping her fit in to the company, but they are in the minority. \nMost people don't know the only reason Skadi refuses to cooperate with others is that she \"doesn't want to put anyone else in danger.\" \nSkadi claims everyone who has ever been close to her has met an untimely end, and as such she has avoided socializing altogether. \nDespite our misgivings, Rhodes Island respects her social choices as long as she does not violate any of our rules. \nRegardless of where it stems from: her birth, her behavior, her body, or her experiences, the mystery of Skadi remains. \nOccasionally, others have seen her sitting on the edge of the deck, softly singing to herself.

But fortunately, I had anticipated her needs, and I think Rhodes Island would be good for her. \nI explained why we were speaking. She reluctantly agreed and promised to divulge certain information in exchange for Rhodes Island's intelligence gathering assistance. \nHer preference for isolation stems from a desire to protect others. She has no malicious intent. However, she is hesitant to trust a capable, powerful organization like Rhodes Island. \nThis is because she believes she has to resolve her own issues. \nIn our long conversation, I promised to her on behalf of the Doctor (and if the Doctor doesn't like this, well, it's for the greater good!) that if an unknown peril hit Rhodes Island that we could not resist, we would give her up. \nI came to two conclusions:\n1. There is a secret organization to which Skadi has close ties. Not only is this organization hostile, it is violent. \n2. This organization goes far beyond just Skadi herself. From her description, I think they experimented on Skadi. Or they could be trying to entice her, little by little. Another possibility is they can't control her right now and don't want to deal with her until they've crushed her spirit. \n\nSkadi also hoped she could find something that would prevent future tragedy. \nDoes that sound antisocial? Wandering alone is a heavy burden to bear... \nSigh, she became a wanderer because she was trying to escape, and also showing some rebellion. \n\nI think... \nI think the Doctor should be in charge of Skadi. Isn't taking care of an Operator's needs necessary to build trust?\nOh, Kal'tsit will disagree with me.

If we screwed up, they would've killed the hostage and all our effort would've been for nothing. \nThe hostage's grandfather was a tough old man who seemed to be Victorian nobility. I think the kidnappers had some reason to go after this kid and it wasn't ransom. They wanted their story to be streamed to the public so Wei Yenwu would look weak. They weren't just ordinary kidnappers. It wasn't that simple. \nThe rescue mission was planned by Wei Yenwu and this kid's grandfather. They used a secret special ops team. It's beside the point, but that team was the prototype for the Guard Department's Special Inspection Unit. There were a lot of tabloids and novels written about them. \nAnyway, they pulled it off. The ringleader was executed and most of his accomplices were killed on the spot. \nThe hostage? She was just a little girl. The kidnappers clearly didn't think about how traumatic the experience would be for her. \nShe didn't end up seeing anything gruesome. She saw a Lungmen police officer rushing out. She saw the heavy Christmas snowfall. She saw the street lamps and the Christmas tree outside the abandoned building. That's pretty good. \nI hope the officers left a good impression on her. \nHow do I know all this? Some old police officers told me about it.

Diagnosis showed that while Oripathy had indeed manifested, it was still in early stages, and had not yet caused much damage to their bodies. The psychological damage to Astesia, however, had been quite severe. She began to doubt the stars themselves, and no longer had faith in the abilities she was once so proud of. During the course of treatment, Astesia took her sister's advice to join Rhodes Island.\nAstesia is quite skilled with a sword. Her family has passed down a form of ceremonial swordplay: a ritual in which one hand holds a celestial orb, while the other holds an originium sword. The dazzling process of advancing, retreating, parrying, and riposting with these items creates the illusion of a starry sky fading in and out of view. This unique style of swordplay combines fencing, astronomy, and originium Arts into a form usable only by those capable of mastering all three disciplines. She has never before set foot on the battlefield, but with her unique skillset, she is confident she can serve as an effective Guard.",

And yet this expression remains quite different from most originium Arts. As far as we know, the connection between astrology and originium Arts is very weak, despite most illustrious astrologers in recent years all agreeing with a level of certainty on a close link between the expression of originium Arts and the celestial bodies. At this point we still have no evidence to support a direct or indirect connection, but we speculate that the emergence of these originium Arts that appear to be linked to the celestial bodies will further convince the common people of these beliefs. Were it not for these techniques, most people would likely return to the scientific explanations for originium Arts, turning away from astrology.\nBack to Astesia, she has reported that she feels her own abilities are weakening. Our observations show that contracting Oripathy has had an effect on the originium Arts she already possessed. These effects will persist for quite some time, but we cannot say what the outcome will be, and whether it will be good or bad for Astesia. We need more time for observation and research.

On the contrary, her passion for technology seems to come from the exoskeletal equipment designed to help her overcome these hardships.\nSomething worth mentioning is that Glaucus was born with antibodies that fight against irritants and poisons. Apart from conventional poisons, nerve paralyzers and hallucinogens are essentially ineffective. Glaucus is eager to accompany the medics' research.

However, these methods often come at considerable cost to herself.\nPerhaps Schwarz does not have as much experience in dealing with monsters as other operators do, but she is uniquely capable among Rhodes Island operators at dealing with human and humanoid foes. In the words of one operator, \"She is like a machine designed specifically to ruthlessly kill humans.\"\nHowever, in the presence of Ceylon, she may still be cold, but she betrays a softer side. Her relationship with Ceylon is less a simple master-servant relationship, and more of a relationship between sisters on equal-footing. She dotes heavily upon her younger sister and will satisfy any of her requests, no matter how unreasonable. She shows tolerance even for her most whimsical notions, and her normally cold voice possesses a certain pampering tone.\nIt is only in these moments that she appears to transform from a machine to a person, in the eyes of spectators.

However, during the event, she chose to stand on the other side. Though she was forgiven, this has still ultimately been taken as a betrayal, and has caused a chain reaction of events.\nIn the analysis of the incident, we can see that the real reason she took the other side was because that she has an inclination toward the city's Mayor, Herman. It is true that she deeply loves Ceylon, but she is not just her puppet. Theoretically, as the mayor's agent, she ought to be the one who understands him the most. Her quote, \"When it's time to shed blood, do not send Lady Ceylon to do it, send someone who lives amongst the shadows,\" is likely an accurate representation of her mentality on this.\nDespite bearing witness to the event, after joining Rhodes Island, Ceylon has still shown some idealistic tendencies. This is normal. She witnessed some of the cruelty that this world is capable of, but the relatively neat resolution to this incident has lightened some of the shock of it. Moreover, not everyone needs to have a deep understanding of this so-called cruel reality.\nHowever, this brings us to the salient point of this discussion: What position should Rhodes Island take on this issue?\nPeople like Ceylon are not a minority in Rhodes Island. Rhodes Island is not purely a research institution and thus our nature determines that we will sometimes come face-to-face with unsavory situations. Do we have an obligation or necessity to expose these members to cruelties they've never experienced before? Or is it enough to abide by Schwarz's quote and \"Send someone who lives amongst the shadows?\"\nThis is a topic worth discussing in more detail.\n——Archivist R.F.",

Actually, aside from giving you a detailed description of the bushes and shrubs I hid in, there isn't much I can tell you. Wait, and then attack - it really is that simple.\nI was born into a family of Rim Billiton merchants. Both of my parents were traders. When I was six years old, they were involved in a deal in which they were tricked into collecting a number of Originium Stones disguised as ordinary gems. I was infected with Oripathy when I stole some of these stones to play with them.\nAfter my parents found out, they went to confront those who had tricked them, but were ambushed and killed en route. I was treated like a slave and sold. In the end, I was selected by a mercenary unit to become their newest member.\nIn addition to carrying out war operations, this mercenary unit was also responsible for carrying out tasks for important men, mostly their dirty work. After I passed their training, I became a child assassin. After several missions, my organization was tasked with staging some accidents\" in a certain city.\nThat is where my fate changed.\nMy task was to assassinate Lady Ceylon's father, but in the process of getting close to him, he subdued me. You can't even imagine. He was a... Forget it, I won't even bring it up. In short, I helped him eliminate my entire mercenary unit. Afterward, I became part-housekeeper, part-bodyguard. That year, Lady Ceylon was three years old, and I was 12.\nActually, what Lady Ceylon doesn't know is that during those years I was a bodyguard, I also helped her father with other matters... Don't get me wrong, I was willing to. The person I care about most is Lady Ceylon but the person I respect the most was her father. That still hasn't changed after all this time.\n......That day, he called me back to Siesta and told me that he found my enemies. Before I set out, he asked me \"Are you sure you want to go? You can live a good life here, Schwarz.\" Ultimately, I went, but not just for revenge, but also to make a clean break. Also, I knew that somebody was waiting for me.\"\n——This story was related by the Doctor personally.

This is what is engraved into her very soul. It is the branding she would not be able to wash off even if she were to spend the rest of her life in the light.\nSo what we must understand is that her hopes for Ceylon may be hard to achieve, but they are not to be taken lightly. For it is only those who have experienced the darkness that understand just how deeply that coldness runs.\nThe only thing worth celebrating is that she recognizes this.\nOnly in this way, perhaps what she says will come true.

When the brass had had enough of her stubbornness, they gave her a promotion, sending her to manage a squad of fresh recruits. She trained the kids, with great frustration, and they in turn changed her disposition. In time, she grew to accept the soldiers as her own. For the sake of their training, she traded her dual electric swords for the sword and shield combo she uses today. She put her heart and soul into her men, right up until the point when the brass decided to send them on a suicide mission. Dur-nar was beside herself. She flew into a rage and assaulted a suprior officer. She has been unwilling to discuss the events that followed. According to certain documents we've acquired, she was forcibly discharged. She then went through a period of hopping from security to police to mercenary work for short stints, up until she arrived at Rhodes Island. When the Doctor asked her in private why she had come to join Rhodes Island, she produced a letter. It was a letter of thanks from the few survivors of her squad of trainees. At the end of the letter, the Doctor fixated on a particular sentence, \"If there were a place where the command actually cared about the grunts, would you give it a try?\" After that was an address to send her resume to Rhodes Island, along with all the names of the survivors.\n\n\"And that's why I'm here.\"",

Indeed, it is true that the Notarial Hall comprises one piece of the Laterano legal apparatus, and the executors attest to an important fact: Laterano takes its responsibility to its citizens very seriously, treating it as a binding contract. \nBut the Laterano people's adherance to the law, or even fear of it, goes behind an executor's power to instill. \nI speak not of the power of religion. The political entities founded on deeply held beliefs go beyond Laterano alone, and the uniqueness of their citizenry cannot be attributed to piety or self-discipline alone. \nThis is also not to say that executors, including Executor, are not themselves strong. Last week, I saw him tear out the aorta of a vicious beast with his bare hands, spraying his partner with blood. That was not the first time an operator came crying to me that \"Executor is terrifying,\" and it certainly won't be the last. \nBut for the hands of its few lawyers, executors, wandering judges, and the Pope himself, Laterano can do little more than proclaim that the law must be followed. \nIn addition to its temporal statutes, Laterano must have another, higher order of law that we cannot perceive. Rather than saying the executor is one piece of the Laterano legal apparatus, it would be more appropriate to say that the executor is the physical manifestation that Laterano created to befit the name of the law. At least that's my opinion. \n\nAll I want to know is what Executor meant by \"the statute that takes effect once a shot is fired\". Given what he said, I have to wonder if this \"law\" might be some kind of Originium Art. \nThis is the first time I have ever seen Kal'tsit at a loss for words. She appeared to have something to say, but turns and left with a cold laugh. The whole time we were discussing Laterano law, she kept a hand over her mouth and an eyebrow raised.

Once the Rhodes Island ship has docked at a certain location, Operators are free to carry out activities in the locale as long as they maintain contact with the ship and do not act in a way that would damage the interests of Rhodes Island.\nBeyond this point, however, Ms. Mostima also has a few peculiarities. According to the application she submitted, Ms. Mostima often proactively seeks out delivery orders that would require her to travel abroad. Usually, Rhodes Island couriers will only operate in a local vicinity, because the time and risk involved in long-distance travel is a serious consideration for even the most experienced in the industry. Yet it doesn't seem to concern Ms. Mostima.\nDoes this mean that she has a special reason for doing so?",

This past month has been stellar, and I think we've all earned a nice meal. On me, as always! \nNow then, I have something to discuss, pertaining to the exchange agreement between Lungmen and Rhodes Island. The first round of applicant review falls on us. We do very important work here! \nEven those of you most familiar with Rhodes Island's regulations will sometimes get confused by some wording or something, right? I know there's one line, hm, it's pretty long in the original, but paraphrased—— \n\"Should an operator fail to meet the needs of Rhodes Island, regardless of motivation or action, they are ineligible for onboarding. Conversely, should an operator appear with an origin or background subject to some scrutiny, as long as they meet our needs and strictly abide by our rules, they remain eligible...\" \nSomething like that! The original text is very dry and very long, so I won't go over it all right now. \nDoes anyone feel the need to ask \"why?\" Let me provide a simple example. \n\nSay there is some remarkable individual who comes highly recommended, with a remarkable set of personal ideals. In order to see their ideals realized, they sacrificed many people, destroyed entire cities, and ultimately succeeded. \nNo matter how great this individual or their ideals, Rhodes Island cannot accept them. We would be nothing but a platform for such a person. \nThen we have another individual, who has their share of problems. The things they do and the ways they do them may seem a bit unreasonable to us. This person submits a resume to Rhodes Island.—— \nSit down! I know you're all eager to say \"we already have a lot of operators like that!\" And there are indeed some! \nThink for a minute how many things happen each and every day in the many cities of the world. Can we settle them all ourselves? \nWhen an operator subjectively plans an action that would harm Rhodes Island's ideas, that operator is immediately expelled. When an operator intentionally violates Rhodes Island's rules and regulations, that operator may be eliminated before they can cause material harm. \nEven if! Even if the regulations are as they are, Rhodes Island has never once done such a thing, we have never seen such an action. Oh, not counting private wire connections. You can blame Closure for those! \nThe adjudication of whether or not an operator is eligible is dependent on his will, not his rap sheet. \nRhodes Island has the ability to observe and study its operators while also maintaining its rules and regulations. At Rhodes Island, some operators are at last able to achieve what they'd always hoped to do. \nAs long as we maintain contact with them, we will respect their choices, within reason, and never force them to act against their own will. \nSometimes, when there remains no other choice, such a thing may come to pass. \nI hope everyone understands this, just as they understand the Infected, and Rhodes Island's mission statement. \n\nFor all candidates, the most important thing is to find them their place at Rhodes Island, and to acknowledge Rhodes Island. \nWe must adhere to this in processing the applicants under this exchange agreement. Understood? \nAh, of course, the Waai Fu girl we just approved is perfectly fine. \n\"——When one is committed to constant reflection and tempering of his ideals, we are willing to serve as his forge.

              "storyText": "[Selected Records]\n\n\"…Next, please turn to page 6 of the handout. I hope that everyone had an opportunity to preview the introduction last night.\nThe lions all claimed to be king, as the Dracos and Aslans each received equal opportunities. Under the terms of this ancient treaty, they were both qualified to become the sole monarch of Victoria. The Dracos symbolized unquenchable thirst for conquest, while the Aslans symbolized power through order. People believed that for countless generations, Victoria was influenced by three forces, including those two.\nLet's not even talk about how many bloody uprisings have been caused by the succession of the throne... Ever since ancient times, people have known that Victoria is not a friendly country capable of handling its own affairs internally. The Aslans originated in Sargon, Leithania, and even some other countries that have since been wiped out by Catastrophes. The Dracos, who were in power, had no reason to peacefully accept a group of outsiders, let alone allow them to rule their country.\nThe treaty that formed between the Aslans and Dracos could not have arisen in a stable and civilized environment. The most harrowing aspects of this history have been made light of, woven into a prologue for the legends that would follow. In this regard, the oral tradition preserved through gypsy bards and poets can be more reliable than \"official sources.\"\nHowever, there are always fragments of truth embedded within legends and tall tales.\nThough a modern state, Victoria has paradoxically sustained its ancient tradition of rule. As early as two decades ago, the Draco bloodline was considered to have been severed, leaving none to threaten the Aslan's firm rule over Victoria-\nWhat happened afterwards was covered in the second class session last month.\n\nHowever, the status quo of Victoria is not the focus of this lecture. What I would like everyone to consider is this: \"Granted that the contract between the Dracos and Aslans was engraved somewhere even more conspicuous than the throne itself, what would happen if there was still a Draco alive out there that could challenge the Aslan rule?\"\nNations that had been dissolved, ethnic groups which had been assimilated, civilizations that had been conquered... they all are waiting for a new banner.\nHowever, one must still consider that depending on the nature of the leader, the ideology that takes root - and the subsequent strength of the movement that it grows into - can be quite different.\n\nNevertheless, I still wish to remind everyone that this so-called \"history\" is happening around us right now, and the trajectory of the future may not be entirely determined by the origins of the ones who decided to set things into motion.\nAfter all...\nHmm? Look at the time... that about concludes things for today's lecture. For next week's class, I'd like everyone to turn to page 14, and familiarize yourself with the life of a typical Draco king and see how his image in history differs from how it is presented in legend. Then, we will discuss the reasons for these differences.\n\nYou had a question, Miss Istina?\nAh, of course. History is the cause of current events. As for my personal interests...\nWhen the Reunion Movement publicly announced its existence to a small number of political entities, most policymakers decided to respond to the threat of a show of power from the Infected with force; and a small number of them were so concerned that just the appearance of a Reunion leader would trigger an immediate response.\nCombined with the fact that Rhodes Island has secretly received some new patients recently, I am looking forward to a day when these lions will no longer rear their heads. After two fulminating red dragons suddenly emerged from the heir of the lost Draco clans, Victoria may once again be cast into a storm of unrest.\n\n\nHmm, if the testimony is true... there might even be three.\"\n\n--Recording of Rhodes Island Lecture No. 43, History of the Empire, Lecturer Hypatia",

Her Arts is very restrictive in terms of the types of materials and receptors that can be acted upon. \nNevertheless, through continuous testing and training, she has honed her Arts in a way that greatly eclipses the complexity and efficacy of the original mode of use.\nWhether using the rise of hot air as a buffer, using the rapid expansion of air around her to generate thrust, or by supercompressing a specific amount of air to create a temperature differential capable of causing a small-scale explosion, Blaze has thoroughly understood how to utilize her Arts.\nShe is also capable of using her own blood to enhance the effect of her Originium Arts, with a greater usage of blood corresponding to a greater increase in efficacy.\nThough sometimes mistaken for a Caster, all illusions of such are quickly dispelled when she approaches them with her heated chainsaw.\n\n\n\"Look, what the hell did they decide to write here?

Among the Operators who struggle on the front lines, Blaze is considered as one of the most dedicated.\nNevertheless, regardless of whether the missions she was deployed to all happened to require such firepower, or because Dr. Kal'tsit deployed her specifically knowing her capacities, most of the missions that Blaze participates in are worth solving using these rather... unrestrained methods.\nLiterally, by erasing the source of the conflict, whether it's a dispute over Originium, ownership of a building, criminal activity, etc., there won't be any conflict remaining.\nThis doesn't mean that Blaze will, like some Operators, cause trouble for her fellow Operators or even be forced to act independently. Her ability to work as part of a team is also one-of-a-kind. In fact, a team with her as the main attacker can safely focus on supporting, defending, and completing other mission objectives, because Blaze can single-handed absorb all the combat pressure for them.\nWould any team refuse a proposition like that?\nAs a matter of fact, yes. Quite a few, actually. Because Blaze's techniques and tactics are often risky and sudden, even if she is capable of achieving the greatest results, only the most capable of team members are able to keep up with her.\n\"Please enter freefall from 300 meters,\" she will often say.\nWhile she reassures them, \"Don't worry, I'll catch you,\" stuff like that is not well-received by the faint of heart.\nOver time, Rhodes Island has come to trust the young and enthusiastic elite, though not enough to treat her as a role model.\nJust don't. Whatever you do, don't try to become another Blaze.\nHowever, trust does not only come from the recognition of strength.\nBlaze is committed in fighting for the rights and interests of the Infected, never wavering in her convictions.\nShe is firmly on the side of the Infected, and stands with all who fight for a just cause.\n\"You know she's trustworthy because she puts her life on the line for you.\"",

The reason was because GreyThroat accidentally touched some Originium-based devices.\nWhile GreyThroat has not taken any radical behavior towards Infected persons, her actions have been a source of discontentment among many younger operators. The ostracized GreyThroat of course takes no issue with this fact, and continues to lead a relatively solitary life in Rhodes Island.\nThe only exception is Amiya, one of the few people she is willing to communicate with. Perhaps due to being separated from her family at a young age, her desire to speak with a peer for support sometimes even eclipses her prejudices. However, even when she is in the same room with Amiya, she carefully maintains her distance, exhibiting mild PTSD at the very beginning. At Amiya's suggestion, and in return for adoption into Rhodes Island, GreyThroat began training for the Operator assessment and learned to use bows and crossbows.

Even those who are vocally opposed to her conduct cannot deny her combat performance. On the battlefield, GreyThroat is far keener than Operators who have served for a similar length of time, her excellent dynamic vision compensating for her lack of marksmanship experience.\nHowever, can a Rhodes Island Operator shoulder her duties while being so hostile and disgusted towards the Infected? In order to address the concerns of others, Amiya personally took the initiative to put GreyThroat on her operation team, and successfully carried out several missions.\nSome people may be hard to change, but many hoped that Amiya would be able to gradually influence this somewhat abrasive girl. But, reality would once again surprise everyone. After a long and harrowing rescue mission, GreyThroat changed dramatically overnight. She began to learn to talk to the Infected, though she still would often touch upon topics that are typically off-limits for the Infected. Her tone was cold, and sometimes even full of barbs, but her frankness began to soften the hearts of many.\nVery few people know about what exactly transpired on that mission, with Amiya and GreyThroat both seldom mentioning it. What is certain, is that GreyThroat is no longer blinded by a myopic hatred. However, is her heart actually free from the shackles of hate? It is not that simple. People who seem to easily let go of a deep-rooted hatred are not trustworthy. After each physical examination following her return for a mission, GreyThroat repeatedly confirms her blood originium-crystal density, accompanied by a near-suffocating fear and subsequent relief, perhaps a reflection of the guilt and ensuing sorrow. GreyThroat still often wakes up with nightmares, and rarely has an opportunity to sleep, whether on a mission or in the Rhodes Island dormitories.\nGreyThroat is still her old self, not like Amiya, not like anyone else. But she will still fight for Rhodes Island, and nobody doubts this anymore.",

At that time, I didn't dare look directly at my mother, and only felt the heat draining from her hand. I didn't understand what happened, why the patients we rescued turned into rioters overnight. Not until I saw my Infected friend, a greasy wrench in hand, vandalizing the street... like a lunatic. Even today, I sometimes still see her expression. What does that mean? I'm not sure.\"\n\"From then on, I couldn't stay calm when talking to Infected people. Since I probably don't need to hide anything from you, Doctor, I'll be frank. In the worst cases, I felt like vomiting. Amiya is the exception though. I really appreciate her. Oh, but don't tell her I said that.\"\n\"But, I've also seen the Infected across this world. The hungry woman using her own blood to nourish a ghastly, malnourished child, exiled to the scorched soil of the barrens, or admitted to some \"clinic\" in name only to die. With no treatment and no food, they eat the soil at the base of the walls, surrounded by the inorganic, petrified bodies of those whose ridiculous lives have long expired. And what is on the other side of that wall? A peaceful, prosperous mobile city devoid of hunger.\"\n\"I have seen the exiled Infected rescue travellers, and I have also witnessed travelling doctors who help these Infected crushed by terror. After becoming an Operator, I have also become involved, trying to help those who have not joined a mobile city-state avoid Catastrophes. One incident still is fresh on my mind. One time, in the face of a flood, Infected villagers held back the water with their own flesh, buying just enough time for the evacuation. And so those Infected gave their lives, their bodies now floating on top of the water, but nobody cares. Do you know how the villagers view these heroes? With disgust. Whether they hate these people or the Originium crystals on their skin, I cannot say.\"\n\"And why is this happening? Amiya told me before, because everyone is a living person. Everyone wants to live, and has the right to survive.\"\n\"Did you know? When Amiya said these words, she did not look like a young girl at all. But I am not the same as her, and there is inevitably a difference between the Infected and non-Infected. I just want to find the balance between the Infected and the people we were born to be, for those around me, for who I am inside.

While most people find the ill-natured Aak to be impossible to deal with, Hung is his natural nemesis. If a situation with Aak truly became unbearable, just report it to Hung, and the situation will soon be resolved. While it cannot be said that Aak fears Hung, Hung unabashedly treats Aak like a little brother; and Aak, despite his usual attitude, probably sees Hung as an older sibling as well.\nThe second is Waai Fu. Though the righteous Waai Fu and the ill-natured Aak would seem totally incompatible, the two have unexpectedly developed a good relationship as members of the same detective agency. Waai Fu believes that Aak is a fundamentally good person, whereas Aak sees Waai Fu as old-fashioned but not impossible to get along with. By the way, if Aak is out looking for trouble, you should call Waai Fu instead of Hung. The ensuing scene is quite entertaining.\nThe third is Warfarin. After learning that the true identity of \"Mr. Blood\" was none other than Warfarin, even Aak, who had spurned mainstream medicine, couldn't help but to engage Warfarin in academic discussions on a frequent basis. Admittedly, Warfarin, whose views towards medicine differ slightly from other medics perhaps as a result of her longevity, and Aak, who is a bit of a freak himself, make an unexpectedly good duo. But as a caveat, when these two find out that they share some common interest and tastes, strange laughing and cheering have become far more prevalent than ever before - either from Warfarin's or Aak's lab, now with two voices instead of one.",

Not to mention, he frequently researches and develops medication that seems incomprehensible to the average person, such as pills that make farts smell like watermelon, or make people lose the ability to recognize a certain color.\nOf course, if you knew who his father is, this tendency is no longer so puzzling.\nAak's father used to be a well-known attending physician at the Lungmen Central Hospital and was renowned for his medical ethics. But due to a certain incident, he was framed by others for malpractice, after which his career plummeted and he disappeared from the public eye. The next time he reappeared, he had become a vicious illegal doctor in the underworld of Lungmen's black zone, with even Lungmen's gang bosses trembling at his feet. When this person perished a few years ago in a gang war, the entire Lungmen underworld breathed a collective sigh of relief.\nAak clearly inherited his father's mantle, both the good and the bad. Even as a teenager, he made a reputation for himself in the underworld. Without discipline, he perhaps would have walked down the same path as his father, eventually becoming feared as well. However, after meeting Hung, he joined Lee's Detective Agency, a move that can be considered a turning point in his life.",

Despite Aak's young age, his views towards medicine have already greatly surpassed that of even experienced doctors who have been immersed within the field for years.\nThe reason behind this is simple: because he left the mainstream medical circles, he no longer views medicine solely from the perspective of a pure doctor.\nPure doctors will think about problems within the scope of medical practice, preoccupied with how to better save people, often losing sleep or forgetting to eat in the process of developing new drugs. Most of Rhodes Island's medics fall under this category.\nHowever, Aak is different. He saw the limitation of medicine, and recognized that the existence of medicine was due to harm. Of course, a large proportion of this harm occurs naturally in the form of diseases, but because Aak grew up in the black zone, he saw more of the harm that people inflicted upon each other.\nOver time, he began to scoff at the idea of pure medicine, resenting his colleagues because they only knew how to save people. They would rush to the scene of a conflict, even the most advanced pharmaceuticals utterly powerless to stop the conflict from having broken out in the first place. The more lofty and prideful the medical profession, the more Aak came to hate it.\nOf course, Aak's thoughts are radical and fringe, with his daily behaviors reflecting a bit of his immaturity. Nevertheless, one cannot deny that his ideas are rooted in the bloody reality that shaped his upbringing, and events sometimes unfold in the way he describes. While Rhodes Island does pursue a lofty dream, it also never looks away from reality.\nAfter getting to really know him, several of Rhodes Island's core medic operators set aside their initial disgust towards him and, as his guardian Hung hoped for, decided to show him a better side of this world and provided him with the best possible conditions.\nAfter all, everyone knows that Aak is a genius, and over time, he will surely mature into a phenomenal doctor.",

While it must be said that Lee's Detective Agency prevented his sense of morality from going too far astray, his psychological issue had not been resolved. Of course, this is not to place the blame upon the agency, for psychological problems usually require professional help even to be detected. Moreover, a personality like his also requires the proper environment.\nAnd at Rhodes Island, Aak is recognized and accepted for who he is. Everyone tells him that he is just, and reminds him that he is the best at what he does. As for the crux of the reason he resents medicine, Rhodes Island is already addressing the issue - we never intended to rely solely on pharmaceuticals to solve all the world's problems.

As soon as Dobermann concluded her speech, Snowsant immediately shot up and approached Dobermann - nobody had ever seen her move so quickly before. Then, she bent over - in front of everyone in the room, picked up a coin, and stood back up. Even Dobermann did not know how to react at that time. Though Snowsant quickly seemed to realize her rude behavior, she stood there for a few seconds before shuffling back to her seat, trembling in front of the whole room.\nWe later learned that her purse had a small hole in it, and the purse was filled with coins that she had painstakingly scrounged up. Surprisingly, though Snowsant was fidgeting around for the coin almost the entire meeting, her notes were almost identical to what was given by Dobermann. We hope that the Operators prone to falling asleep during meetings can learn a thing or two from her diligence.\nAlthough sometimes this diligence reaches a level that makes others worried about her health, most Operators watch over her fondly as this frail girl carefully and painstakingly goes about her work.",

Perhaps due to their shared similarities - both girls being kind, hard-working, and conscientious, the two quickly came to understand each other, and sympathized with and admired each others' experiences.\nOf course, in the eyes of outsiders, these two girls also have strikingly similar weaknesses. There are too many talented people surrounding them, which makes them underestimate their abilities, and they compensate through an almost stubborn work ethic, taking one step at a time.\nHowever, despite understanding each other in many regards and confiding in each other, after learning about Jessica's monthly expenditures on firearms, equipment, and Originium bullets, Snowsant once questioned Jessica's grasp of currency and basic mathematical knowledge. If you see the two eating together at a cafeteria, don't be surprised if you see Snowsant with an empty tray in front of her. While Jessica is certainly capable of helping Snowsant financially, she also knows the value of the sacrifices Snowsant is willing to make for her ideals. Perhaps, the two of them really can become each others' emotional pillar of support.",

Even after her scholarships and salary from the research institute eased her financial burdens, she continued her frugality in order to fund her independent research and development projects.\nFrom the smallest of things, such as turning off the lights before going outside or recycling whatever she could, Snowsant had precise calculations and plans for all her daily expenses. After rigorously withholding what she needed for her research funds and squeezing anything out of her living expenses, she would send whatever was left over back to her hometown.\nIt is worth mentioning the industrial clawhooks that Snowsant carries with her. Reportedly, this clawhook is the first scientific achievement that Snowsant made by herself before leaving Lungmen. Obviously, she had no idea how to use patent rights and marketing to turn a profit for herself. She simply took this clawhook to participate in a certain regional industrial design competition, relying on the meager proceeds to buy a one-way ticket to Columbia to begin chasing her dreams.\nSnowsant has little confidence in her abilities, and though I don't know when, some very successful people who understood the value of her quiet diligence turned their attention towards her and invited her back to Lungmen when the time was right.",

Under the crushing weight of utter disappointment, she took out the lucky charm bag that her grandmother had prepared for her. Within it was but a piece of paper with the four words: \"Heaven rewards the hardworking.\"\nThough useless for her situation, Snowsant cheered up and found solace in those words.\nHeaven rewards the hardworking, and the proverb became reality.\nThree days later, Snowsant received an invitation from officials in Lungmen's upper echelons. Though the research institute tried to persuade her to stay upon learning this news, Snowsant eventually rejected the institute's offer and returned to her hometown with a deep longing in her heart.",

With the exception of the few familiar faces she had met before, there were far too many people waiting to make her acquaintance. Of course, her priority is not so much becoming acquainted with people, but rather becoming acquainted with food. In the place where everyone gathers to eat, there is a certain door. On the other side is a world of countless edibles, waiting for her to sample. She's not particularly subtle in her efforts to sneak in, resulting in a high probability of being found and shown the way out. However, that doesn't seem to deter her - at least until she's tasted the contents of all the bottles and cans there.\nIn light of the fact that Ceobe is still learning about the norms of civilized life, everyone privately agreed to not punish her when she gets caught, and some people even took the opportunity to feed Ceobe some strange things. Though these people usually fall under one of three categories - the experimenters, the kind-hearted, and those who just wanted to make fun of her, Ceobe generally only has two words to say about the things she eats: \"Yummy,\" or \"Good.\" No one can coax any other words out of Ceobe - naturally, the experimenters can't get the kind of data they're looking for, the kind-hearted pretty much all get the same few responses, and those who try to make fun of Ceobe are undertaking a self-defeating task. Over time, the number of people casually trying to feed Ceobe decreased as well.\nAlthough she has indulged in many foods of all shapes and sizes since coming to Rhodes Island, if asked to pick out the food she loved the most, she would choose honey biscuits. As a matter of fact, honey biscuits are the only thing that she seems to be picky with - currently, she only accepts biscuits baked by Lava, Vulcan, and Matterhorn. She won't touch even a single crumb of the biscuits baked by anyone else - even by the logistics chief.\nSummary: She won't eat, but she absolutely can eat just about everything. She loves honey biscuits. If the day comes where she's in the mood to eat the entirety of Rhodes Island, she'll likely do just that.",

Her curiosity led her to seek the meaning behind the axe, so she stopped to ask a question to the first person she could find - and thus began her life of wandering. Along the way, when she got hungry, she ate wild fruits. When she was thirsty, she drank water from the rivers. Her journeys took her away from most of civilization. Because she didn't have the ability to discern areas that were contaminated with Originium, Ceobe quickly contracted Oripathy, and what she described as \"black crystals\" started to appear across some parts of her body. At first, these growths were a source of fear for her, but as she continued to wander, she began to see the power that these crystals had brought her - her weapons had grown stronger. Ceobe's fears were soon replaced with a strong desire to obtain more weapons, an uncontrollable impulse that often drove her to resort to violence to satisfy. Though she tried to suppress these impulses and use peaceful methods to obtain weapons, the outcomes would often differ greatly from her expectations. Sometimes she would rescue others, sometimes she would injure them; Some would reward her with weapons for completing tasks for them, some would use weapons to try to lure her, while others would gift them to her with no strings attached. In any case, her journey took her far to the east, where a well-intentioned person told her that she had taken the wrong way. With her large collection of weapons and tales in tow, she turned around and returned west. Her journey finally came to an end when she attacked a Rhodes Island squad led by Fang while trying to obtain food.\nWhile Ceobe lacked the qualifications to become an Operator, the HR Department finally gave her an opportunity to take the Operator evaluation exam upon Vulcan's recommendation. She had no expectation of becoming an Operator, nor did she know what such a job entailed, but she still demonstrated a great desire to become one. After becoming a fully-fledged member in Rhodes Island, her daily routine of eating, drinking, and fighting, combined with medical treatment of her Oripathy, also alleviated her strange fixation upon collecting weapons. She has grown accustomed to her comfortable lifestyle, and hopes that her time her can last forever if possible...\nAs long as someone can unlock the secret of her axe.",

In the past, this ability was a subconscious process that she could not control, and therefore she didn't give much thought into it. Now, under the tutelage of Rhodes Island Operators, she is working hard to understand her unique skill: though she may never be able to master the fundamentals of Originium Arts through studying, she must learn enough to operate her skills on a basic level, which would be enough to help her achieve a baseline level of identification and control and strengthen her abilities all around.

Many mature schools of Originium Arts share similar methods of inheritance - for example, Leithanians use movements, the Sarkaz lead through ceremonies, and various guilds of Arts practitioners conduct research, all for the purpose of passing down the theoretical and practical components of Originium Arts. As one of the traditional Originium Arts originating from Yan, Lei Fa has a deeper history than most other forms of Arts. As a system shrouded in mysticism, the requirements for practitioners of Lei Fa are also restrictive and physically demanding. Its inheritance system gradually evolved into a solemn ritual of sorts, much like the passage of power. The end result was that Lei Fa tacitly became synonymous with the position of power, subsuming the popular symbol of law enforcement, and even becoming a form of self-cultivation in the quest for spiritual transcendence. As for rumors of the physical basis of \"transcendence,\" I can only say that as an Originium Arts researcher outside of Yan's cultural circles...

The grim reaper would not lie to you when asked why it has come, but this woman would not leak a hint of why she's here even if starved for three days. What are we supposed to do?\nWhat?! She even applied to join an operational squad? And it was approved?!\nUghh... My stomach hurts and I want to resign from the HR Department and go home.\nDobermann's smiling at me with a look of resignation on her face. Whatever, how odd that a she can smile like that at a time like this.",

              "storyText": "[Sixth Record]\nWe consider ourselves lucky.\nSome Operators, such as Skadi or Shining, don't seem to care at all about this issue. The fact that they can focus on their goals and practically ignore all the rest of the background noise is good for their work.\nSome others are concerned, but are just keeping silent about the matter. For example, Ansel brought up the issue several times, but decided against it each time and left after dropping off some snacks. They've struck a good balance between curiosity and their sense of responsibility.\nOr, they simply don't know anything about it. I once witnessed Cuora getting lost and ending up in front of Leizi's dorm, only to have dinner with her before being sent back to Block A. Cuora will recount how they had four main dishes that night as well as a soup, concluding that Leizi is a very nice person, end of story.\nYet another type is those who have already been bound up and silenced, not even uttering a word about the matter even if tortured. Yesterday, I caught Blaze slacking off while I was on duty. Even though this time it was basically just bureaucratic busywork, and Blaze tends to use this time to get some rest and relaxation, she actually ran over to the intelligence room to go over files with the person who complains most often about her work ethic - Leizi. Amiya, who was standing at the doorway, even vouched for them before apologizing to me and pushing me out. She still had that faint smile as she waved me goodbye.\nSome of us are definitely going crazy, and I've begun to suspect that it's actually me. Having that said, this proves that in addition to gathering data, Leizi has a vested interest in \"maintaining amicable relationships with her targets.\" While it's true that she hasn't done anything yet, she also has been concealing her whereabouts from the rest of the world.\nAt first, I interpreted her application for long-term board as a form of rhetoric. In that regard, I admit I was in the wrong. It's just that to write this whole thing off as \"improving relationships\" is far too suspicious.\nHow ironic. Concealment and deceit have turned into a method of expressing trust, and turning a blind eye in order to coexist together has become the new norm.\nFortunately, the great powers have not turned their gaze upon Rhodes Island just yet, a neglect which has already saved us several times.\nOf course, if she was trying to spy on us, it would be stupid to walk in with an official state-sponsored identity. But that is precisely why we cannot rule out the possibility, and must do our best to maintain confidentiality and control the information going out.\n\nTo be honest, she is very good at her job. A pity that she is not one of our Operators.\nI can actually make some inferences about what happened to her before, and it's entirely understandable why she seems to be in a rather odd state.\nPerhaps now, the only proof of her true self is that tone of voice, and her golden locks that flow like electricity. I believe that she is in a self-imposed exile as a result of this case.\nNo matter where you are, there is a price to be paid for being selfless. If you fully dive into this cause, you will also give up your future. However, now that I think about it, surely the Central Judicial Office has no shortage of such personnel?\n\nI admire her courage and perseverance fleeing here by herself. That would be a reason to shelter her even if she didn't pull her weight.\nThe hardships that she must endure from here on out, and the path that she must take, may yet be unknown to her still. No, I'm sure she knows full well, but simply has chosen not to act upon it.\nSome people believe that those who work in the judiciary have a strong moral compass, and everyone can see that on display. In Leizi's case, she readily apologizes if she is wrong, and never toots her horn when she is right. You will never be able to get someone like her to stop bowing her head. It's a part of who she is.\n\nDespite her many virtues, a glaring blemish is her attitude towards the Infected. By the looks of things, this is not something that can be changed in a short time.\nHowever, just as day and night eventually blend together, I trust that a day will come when she understands the plight of the Infected. After all, she needs our help as well. I heard that Leizi spoke of a certain time in Yan, or a certain season... something involving the spring's first roar of thunder. The spring thunder is supposed to penetrate the darkness of the long winter.\nI'll look after her, provided I don't get pissed off to all hell by those who are keenly interested in her personal belongings, like Haze and Rope.",

              "storyText": "Of course, despite the fact that Miss Bagpipe gives off the impression of a cheery \"girl next door,\" the fact remains that she indeed was an official soldier in the Victorian army - and an excellent one at that.\nThe Victorian Royal Guard Academy is multi-directional in its educational framework. Unlike other systems of military training, this academy has its own educational policy: of the three directions, most graduates serve as guards for the royal family, nobles, or various dignitaries. Officers generally serve as senior-level commanders in the army, while sergeants generally serve as the army's field commanders and first responders. As a graduating sergeant, Miss Bagpipe undoubtedly possess exceptional military talent.\nIn fact, there are significant fundamental differences when comparing the training of Operators and soldiers.\nOperator training places more emphasis on individual and squad operations, cultivating along the lines of their aptitudes in order to maximize their strength. As reflected by Rhodes Island's collection of highly individualized personalities, Operators must capitalize on their uniqueness, cooperating to complete various objectives with the fewest number of elite Operators.\nOn the other hand, military training emphasizes the collective. The development of a corps is comprehensive, stressing the importance of standardization and interchangeability. The military tends to make decisions based upon overall functionality rather than upon individuals in order to ensure the stability and efficiency of the team.\nDue to this need for comprehensive training, a soldier's combat capabilities must be higher than that of an average qualified Operator. Nevertheless, these two roles scarcely warrant a comparison, because an Operator's job should not be applicable to war - this is something that is to be avoided as much as possible.\nAs a result, Miss Bagpipe is unable to directly become a role model for the other Operators when it comes to developing combat abilities. This was evident early on when Dobermann, Liskar, and Nearl, all professional soldiers, joined Rhodes Island. Though they quickly adapted to their new environment, their military training posed many striking contradictions with Rhodes Island's combat principles.\nHowever, Bagpipe, who passed the military training examination with perfect marks and served in the front lines on the battlefield, still is a prime example of what a good soldier in active service looks like. This should be a healthy wake-up call for certain Operators who think they can match the caliber of professional soldiers, or simply have no idea how the military works.\nThough the projectile function has been removed from her piledriver spear, the weapon itself is still a terrifying ordnance of war. Do not let your curiosity get the better of you - or your life.\nAdditionally, it is worth mentioning that whether due to her natural open-mindedness or due to Victoria's exceptional educational system worthy of its name, Miss Bagpipe did not require retraining when transitioning from a soldier to an Operator, adapting quickly to the new position.\nAs an Operator, she demonstrated the resilience and discipline of a soldier; as a soldier, she exhibited the flexibility and fluidity of an Operator. This has led to Dobermann commenting in private: \"Victoria's superiority over other countries... starts from the professionalism of their military.\"",

              "storyText": "Even after graduating from Victoria's Royal Guard Academy and being baptized into modern life, Miss Bagpipe, who was born in one of Victoria's nomadic villages, has retained her countryside flair.\nThis seems to be a product of her experiences growing up in a rural setting, as well as a result of the way she was brought up by her mother. As everyone knows, Vouivre women tend to be very strong.\nSince she was a child, she helped her family with farming and animal husbandry. After joining Rhodes Island, she brought those valuable experiences over to the logistics personnel in charge of related matters. Her enthusiasm in these subjects even made some think that she was transferred to the logistics department.\nFurthermore, she is familiar with large-scale agricultural equipment. Unfortunately, due to space constraints, Rhodes Island's agricultural projects only allow for the use of small tractors, much to her dismay. After all, we can't simply hand over the entire ship to her. \nOf course, none of this means that Miss Bagpipe has no knowledge of modern life - she tried it, but failed. This is somewhat evident from her relatively frequent maintenance applications compared to the other Operators.\nAlso, according to her, she tried to learn how to apply makeup from her upper-crust classmates as a student, but the results were hopelessly embarrassing. She gradually gave up on developing herself in these areas, but she of course is still self-conscious about her appearance... Though she is impeccably dressed as a soldier, she seems to be rather anxious about her casual dress and appearance.\nBut those concerns are hardly warranted. After all, several Operators find her to be cute enough as she is.",

              "storyText": "This was mentioned above briefly, but in fact, if Bagpipe so desired, she could well obtain an enviable status in Victoria's Second Army. Victoria, as the most prosperous empire in Terra, is inseparable from its vast military might. As a sergeant, Bagpipe can also enjoy better treatment than regular foot soldiers, and that's not even factoring in her personal abilities... If she wished to pave a path from her role as an excellent officer to becoming a noble in the big city, there would be nothing in her way\nHowever, she rejected that path. Bagpipe chose to leave the army and her comrades-in-arms, even leaving Victoria behind to roam the dangerous land.\nHer decision to leave civilization and step out into the wilderness is a choice that ordinary city-state dwellers cannot comprehend. After all, leaving the security of civilization is practically a death wish. Bagpipe endured her arduous journey, travelling with Messengers, cooperating with mercenaries, catching whatever rides she could and accepting what little hospitality was available. Due to her identity and nationality, she was forcefully kicked out of some cities, drew the hatred of many, and even got pulled into dangerous conspiracies. According to her, \"I've seen it all.\"\n\nNow, she has arrived at Rhodes Island. The friendly Rhodes Island Operators were willing to join her in her struggles, extending a hand of assistance to this seasoned soldier. However, that was the moment her steps faltered.\nThe more she comes to understand Rhodes Island, the more confused she becomes. After going through a series of tests and information exchanges, she became agitated and unhappy upon learning of Reed's presence.\nWhat is it that is weighing down upon her mind? What kind of problem exists that could not be solved by Victoria's military? What happened in Victoria, and what did she and her regiment encounter?\n\n\"I used to be a soldier of Victoria. This doesn't seem... to be a responsibility of Rhodes Island. Although I'm no longer in the army, I'm sorry. I... I still am responsible for this. This is part of our duty, and also why we left.\"\nMaybe it's not the right time yet.\nMorever, even though everyone looks up to her as a model soldier, the Bagpipe who toils hard in the fields, the Bagpipe who carries three saucepans over to the table, the Bagpipe who sings and spins while wearing a long skirt, the Bagpipe who regales us with dazzling tales of her hometown...\nEveryone loves that side of her too.",

Instead, she, as an Operator, decided to try to open up, albeit slowly and carefully. \nShe might be scared, but she can't run away forever.\nAt least, if one was to consider \"Rhodes Island's Most Likeable Ranking,\" she and Grani unsurprisingly topped the list. The image of her carrying Grani on her shoulders, running through the halls \"harassing\" various Operators, remains a fond memory in everyone's hearts.",

He simply continued forward, striving to catch up to his esteemed older brother - a brilliant, sensible, eloquent, and proficient prodigy who had already secured various patents for his inventions. Sesa threw himself at his studies to be admitted to the same prestigious school as his brother with the hope of one day working with him.\nSesa's brother, seven years his elder, worked for a massive military contractor in Columbia after graduation, and put together the company's largest research lab. Six months before his graduation, Sesa finally arrived at the military laboratory for an internship. However, a cruel twist of fate separated the two brothers, when an explosion from an experimental accident claimed the life of his older brother. The sudden loss of his older brother shattered the goal he had poured himself into so ardently his whole life. With his excellent grades, he was still able to continue his education, but he immediately rejected an invitation to stay at the lab and left the college after barely graduating.\nSesa secluded himself in his room for a long time until one day, he left a letter to his father and departed.",

Beyond the obvious, however, it is important to note that modifying Originium firearms is extremely dangerous. From the fact that his modifications allow those who cannot use Originium Arts to operate such weaponry, one can surmise that Sesa must have made many unfathomable breakthroughs in his craftsmanship. His name soon became a mainstay in the black markets due to his reputation for excellent craftsmanship. Surprisingly, Sesa's own talent for Originium Arts is not enough for him to easily master the use of Originium equipment. In fact, he struggles to operate even the most basic of Originium weapons. For this somewhat famous weapon modifier, the reality seems a bit hard to believe as well, and this is perhaps the reason for the modifications he's made upon his own grenade launcher.\nLater, when we investigated the laboratory incident, we found that Sesa's late brother, as the leader of the military laboratory, was far more proficient in Originium Arts than Sesa.\nThis may be the reason why Sesa has gone through such painstaking efforts, tapping into a far greater talent so that he too may be able to pick up a grenade launcher.",

We found it difficult to believe that such an accident could take place in one of Columbia's most prestigious military laboratories. With this bit of skepticism in mind, we uncovered the greatest doubt of this whole incident: the fact that it was an illegal experiment.\nIn reality, the military giant that Sesa and his brother worked for did not focus on Originium firearms that can only be used by a select few, as the versatility and lethality of such weapons generally fell short of just applying Originium Arts to traditional crossbows.\nThough the most crucial information can only be understood by Columbian military and government officials, according to some contacts, we have every reason to believe that the project the two brothers pursued is the same one that Sesa has mastered - eliminate the high barrier of entry of using Originium firearms. This can also explain why the company has not faced any backlash from either the government or the private sector despite such a major accident. The person in charge of the ill-fated experiment has even risen through the ranks, becoming a point of resistance that even Rhodes Island cannot continue to investigate. \nIt must be noted that even though Sesa's work has been described with awe on the black market, all he can do is enhance existing weaponry. Though Sesa might come closer to it than most people, the idea of \"letting anyone pick up an Originium firearm even without being able to use Arts\" is inherently not feasible and not allowed. Originium-based technology might still have its limitations, but if certain people throughout Terra catch wind of these developments and attempt to use this technology to escalate geopolitical conflicts, there is no telling what kind of brutal, all-consuming wars we may face in the future.\n\"The power I deliver is growing closer to the real deal, and it is both dangerous and eye-catching... So, uh, that's why it's absolutely necessary to keep this technology under wraps!\" He explained it himself.\nBut if this is true, is it possible that the person responsible for the accident that buried Sesa's brother... Sesa himself? Despite attempts to verify this, Rhodes Island has no right to pry into a subject that he seeks to avoid.",

Based upon available historical records, there are few mentions of those called \"Conviction,\" but one can clearly conclude that this name does not refer to any specific single person. In history books, descriptions of Conviction's race are not consistent, with the earliest records stating Conviction as from Minos. Despite these discrepancies, these records are all similar without exception in describing Conviction as beautiful in appearance, good at dancing, harboring a strong sense of justice, generally being skilled at a special type of boxing, and proficient with arts.\nUnlike normal boxing techniques, Conviction's special technique weaves in Originium Arts. Often referred to as \"Conviction Punch\" in records, this special combat style is characterized by footwork akin to dance steps. According to the depiction on a mural, this is a type of assassination technique designed to strike in an unexpected way. Some of the attacks within this technique, when first launched, may appear to just be dance moves to observers. However, bystanders may also get hurt in the process.\nThe most details about Conviction in the historical record are said to come from a number of chapters from a certain story, and this is considered to be the most reliable known source despite slight discrepancies in the details.\n\nFrom \"The Way of Arts - Apocrypha of Conflict\":\nOn the first year of the modern epoch, a group of artists established the ancient kingdom of \"Agamem.\"\nAmong the artists of Agamem, a group of them rose to become the ruling class and in a bid to seize all the country's property, announced a national ban on the creation of high-end art and declared the tomato as the country's sole staple food.\nThe artists of the country soon were forced into a miserable existence, trying to sell inferior works of art in order to put tomatoes on the table.\nOne day, an artist stood up to challenge the unjust rule. On the first day of April, the artist convicted the seven rulers with a series of superb punches. As a result, Agamem was able to enjoy a long period of peace, and flourished as a paradise for artists.\n\n\"Agamem? Super Artist Wars? Only eating tomatoes? What a load of rubbish. Why not focus on the birth and life of Conviction? Does the person who wrote this book bear some ill will against Conviction's peerless power?  If it was up to me, information other than the Conviction and Art won't be included! Quick, find the person who wrote this book! I shall convict them!\"",

However, there is no indication that anything resembling a \"train\" or train-related technology existed in ancient Agamem, but the records clearly state that \"trains\" did in fact exist. This sheds some doubt upon the authenticity of the origins of the \"train dilemma.\"\nThere is also a variant of the train dilemma involving trolleys, but electric trolleys were invented even later than trains were...\n\n\"Conviction's Justice\" : \nWhen Conviction brought judgment upon Agamem, seven criminals were seized for suppressing the development of art.\nIn order to punish them, Conviction tied six of them on the train tracks of an Durin train.\nThe last was posed an impossible problem, doomed to ponder this question forever while eating nothing but tomatoes.\nTo commemorate the artist who stood up in the face of injustice, the people of Agamem named this person \"Conviction,\" and the problem was named the \"train dilemma.\"\nAs a caution to future generations, people reminded themselves to exercise their arts and to never be picky eaters, lest they too be posed with the terrifying train dilemma.\n\n\"300 Philosophy Study Exercises\" : \nConviction brought 7 convicted artists to a railroad that split off into a forked junction; five of the convicted artists are tied to one side of the tracks, while one was tied to the other track.\nAt this time, a Durin train is headed towards the junction and is about to run over the side where 5 convicted artists are tied down.\nThe last of the 7 convicted artists is not tied down, and there is a lever next to him. If he pulls the lever, the train will change course, only running over one person.\nConsidering the above situation, if you are the last convicted artist, should you pull the lever? (50 points available)\n\n\"What's wrong with eating tomatoes every day? I'd gladly do that anyway. The rest of you aren't down for that? Forget about becoming Conviction, you're not even good enough to be an ordinary artist. Now that's the true crime. Oh, that's right! I know a great way to help you find enlightenment - you just have to lie down on those tracks over there!\"\n\"The train needs a Durin to operate, right? Wait, are you seriously asking why this matters? That's part of the art. Art, you understand? The kind of person operating the train, the brand of the train, what material the tracks are made of, the rope used to tie these people, and how many people are tied down to each rail - these all factor into the equation. Each of these small details determine whether or not the train rises to the standard of a dilemma - is that how you really see it? Well, don't blame me for what happens next!

The number of techniques in \"Conviction Punch\" corresponds to the number of people who were sentenced by Conviction.\n\"Abridged History of Dance\" :\nAgamem's Way of the Righteous Fist shall be passed down forever.\n\n\"Legends of Righteousness - The Conviction Saga\" :\nIn many folk tales, Conviction did not directly deliver sentences because the convicted party may have been innocent. As a result, Conviction would issue the train dilemma to test the party in question. Conviction would praise those who passed the test on having great talent in the arts, and encourage them to persevere in their pursuit of art until their works entered the annals of classics.\nIt is said that at first, artists that weren't main stream were outcasted; but over time, these artists rose to fame as talented judges of virtue. These are all related to Conviction.\nCertain medical reports exist suggesting that only eating tomatoes for an extended period of time leads to nutritional imbalances.\n\n\"Who dares classify my Conviction Punch as a dance? And what is this about nutritional imbalances? Do I look scrawny to you? Hmph! Hmph! I bet you can't even follow my fist! An ordinary Operator's gonna get sent flying if they eat one of these!

Prolonged exposure to this Originium-dense environment unknowingly awakened Originium Arts within the young girl, and prolonged contact through potable water, food, wound sites, etc., further exacerbated her rampant and uncontrollable Arts. After learning about this situation, Miss Shamare was quickly transferred to the Rhodes Island landship for medical treatment and management.

In addition, Shamare also demonstrates interests that are incomprehensible to others, frequently talking to herself using antiquated jargon. At first, Medics thought this was possibly a symptom of contracting Oripathy at such a young age. Later on, when visiting the attendants who were responsible for taking care of Shamare, we found that many of them did not blindly heed the myths and rumors, and even after becoming aware of the various possibilities, still chose to regard Shamare with malice and ill will. While most of them have expressed regret for these sentiments, the truth is that every time they would leave the island, they would quietly plead with the ferrymen to take them away. When they got into town, they were often viewed as accomplices to some horrific crime even though they were merely shopping, a testimony to the unfair treatment they would receive. Understandably, no amount of good intentions can offset the withering bombardment of negativity. \nOver time, the townspeople who didn’t know the truth came to establish the dominant narrative, and even the attendants who had stayed with the young girl for many years started to view her in the same light.

We should all think rationally about the “supernatural events” happening around Shamare, and believe that there are naturalistic explanations for these phenomena...\nAddendum: So far, no one has fully elucidated Shamare or the mystery of her Originium Arts.

At first, we thought that her references to “divinations” and “curses” were coping mechanisms to deal with her environment over time or perhaps due to the fact that her Arts subconsciously harmed others in the area, resulting in her attributing everything to the work of evil spirits in order to understand what was happening around her. \nBut based upon Shamare’s performance in some missions, as well as bits of data gathered from Originium Arts tests, we were all surprised to find that Shamare’s Originium Arts do far more than strongly influence the consciousness of others. Notably, she borrows the spells of “Morti” to inflict observable physical damage to enemies. Are mental suggestions strong enough to cause deviations in a target’s brain function, enough so to cause rupture and hemorrhaging? Although this hypothesis is quite tantalizing, it is fundamentally a fantasy from the perspective of modern Originium Arts technological research. Even more strikingly, her predictions and divinations are sometimes surprisingly accurate. For example, the last time we secretly replaced the Originium fiber filling inside Morti with ordinary cotton, she very unhappily divined the misfortunes that would befall a number of us. Some of these predictions included taking a fall from a chair breaking, getting hit by an unknown passing-by Sankta, and getting lacerated by broken test tube fragments - all of which came true! There’s a bruise on my head, you say? Hm? And this is because we’re supposedly already affected by her spiritual suggestions...? \nThat... can’t be right, can it? Ahem... We’ve got to have a bit more trust in our patients, don’t we! Even if Shamare can’t fully control her powers at times, there’s no way she’d be able to influence the entire research team without our notice, right? At least the recorder should be able to remain objective about this! \nMore importantly, whose dumb idea was it to give her a doll with that weird Originium stuffing anyway?

Due to the bitter consequences of wealth inequality and classism from a young age, Sideroca left Corinia to wander the various Minosian city-states as a mercenary. In the past, she always wanted to go far away from Corinia to see different facets of life, but after some time as a mercenary, she realized she would never be able to flee from Corinia, the heart of Minosian trade as well as her splendid motherland. However, her struggle was not fruitless - in her line of work, she came across two other nomadic city-states that rivaled her home: Athenus, the spiritual garden of Minos, and Lakedaímōn, the sacred ground of warriors. In these places, she was able to encounter different philosophies as well as different ways of life, and at the same time, it was in these places that the vast world beyond Minos was revealed to her. One day, she will leave her home and travel to a new country. If Corinia taught anything to Sideroca, it is perhaps a lifelong desire for exploration and a deep pragmatism.",

Many people have voiced doubts about whether such a young woman would be qualified for that line of work, but Sideroca’s first employer, the president of the Minos branch of Rhodes Island, did not share those concerns. As long as the task can be successfully completed, she cared not for the experience, or lack thereof, of the person carrying out the task. By the time Sideroca officially joined Rhodes Island, she had an impressive track record of zero tasks failed, even completing tasks that allowed the mercenaries to abandon their goods in order to ensure their own safety. Of course, her accomplishments also came at a price, perhaps evident by the extra scars across her body. After several years of cooperation, the head of Rhodes Island’s Minos branch decided to grandfather her into the main organization - after all, she didn’t want this trusty talent to be snatched up by competitors. As such, Sideroca officially became an operator of Rhodes Island.",

One group of employers called her “responsible and dedicated to every task.” The other group called her “nosy, with the very troublesome tendency of asking too many questions.” The reason for these two different types of evaluations is actually quite simple: Sideroca habitually wants to go above and beyond for her employer. While this is beneficial to completing the task, it can also be unsuitable for employers who wish to conceal information from their mercenary hires. The head of Rhodes Island’s Minos branch once gave her the following advice: “Only take on short-term contracts, or stick with one employer until retirement.” She understands that Sideroca’s cold personality cannot conceal her inner dedication and work ethic. By working under the right employer, it is possible to achieve twice the outcome with half the effort, but once... because of this very reason, when she learned that the Minos Foreign Trade Union was attempting to strike a long-term deal with Sideroca, she went directly to Sideroca to snag her up before she could sign that contract. When representatives from the Trade Union arrived at Sideroca’s temporary residence, she had already left Minos to start a new life at Rhodes Island. However, there was one thing that even the savvy branch leader could not anticipate...\nIf Sideroca really stayed under the same employer for too long...",

At the time, Instructor Dobermann also has very “vivid” memories of Sideroca. She says that while it is normal for people to proactively improve themselves during Hell Week, it is inexplicable that someone would ever want to put themselves through Hell Week ever again. In her eyes, Sideroca is the kind of person who can incorporate a brutal regimen like Hell Week as part of their own regular fitness routine, even with already excellent qualities. Because Sideroca kept signing up again and again, Dobermann put her foot down and no longer allowed Sideroca to take the same courses as fresh recruits - after all, that would only serve to intimidate them. Consequently, Dobermann put together a specialized regimen, delving into new training manuals, standard army training, and special operations training and incorporating them to meet Sideroca’s needs. She even made an agreement with Dur-nar afterwards, gaining her support in exchange for compromises in some other areas, in order to work together against this person who constantly made the life of the instructors that much harder. Eventually, they discovered that only two things could tear Sideroca away from this almost self-destructive urge to train - going out on missions, or diverting her attention onto the Doctor. Thus, after they deliberately “leaked” some information about the Doctor’s recent malady, Sideroca poured all her energy and enthusiasm into taking care of the Doctor. Even with all of that, however, the reserve operators frequently see Sideroca laboring away on the training grounds.",

It’s just far too arrogant.” \nPhantom was quite frank about his work as an independent assassin. As the general public is quite aware of the nature of this profession, this quiet assassin from Victoria usually keeps a low profile and has few words to say, even after becoming an employee. Phantom has also disclosed little about his prior experiences. \nAccompanying Phantom on his arrival to Rhodes Island was a person as mysterious and alluring as the night itself, someone known as “Ms.Christine.” Through her demeanor, it was clear that she was a refined and haughty woman. No one knows whether she will remain or leave, and she is not always seen with Phantom, instead happy enough to wander around as if quietly patrolling her turf. \n\nAppendix\nThree suggestions when encountering Ms.Christine:\n1. Never touch Ms.Christine. Wait for her to approach, and accept when she leaves. \n2. Show a respectful attitude towards her, as if deferring to a beautiful maiden. \n3. Maintain a pleasant demeanor.",

Scientists have found that by combining biological theory with the experience of engineering, they are in a better position to solve various problems encountered in the fields of biology and medicine. This new discipline quickly became closely linked to the practice of medicine. \nEspecially for a company like Rhodes Island that seeks to develop drugs to inhibit and treat Oripathy, a bioengineering laboratory can be said to be a necessity. \nHowever, even if Rhodes Island offers a favorable salary compared to the rest of the industry, it is well-known as a pharmaceutical company that specializes in Originium research and Oripathy treatment. Naturally, these are subjects that would discourage most people. \nBut even setting this point aside, the fact that Rhodes Island needs to be mobile, and the existence of tech companies such as Rhine Lab that can provide a better baseline, has caused Rhodes Island to be at a disadvantage when competing for talent. \nFurthermore, Rhodes Island is not purely a pharmaceutical company, and many prospective employees decide to leave after learning about Rhodes Island’s true purpose. \nAll in all, despite the considerable successes of Closure's Engineering Department in attracting a vast amount of talent, Rhodes Island's recruiting efforts are far from enough to meet the scope of the challenges. Closure can often be heard complaining about these difficulties, but she knows that there is little that can be done to improve the situation. \nDespite these conditions, there is, according to Closure, one department that she never has to worry about, and that is the Bioengineering Department led by Weedy.",

Setting aside the complicated relationship between Laterano and Ægir, Iberia is a land full of flair and friendly to scientific research, although this friendship is conditional. \nA tacit understanding exists within the scientific community that one is free to conduct whatever research they choose within certain fields; and undeniably, Iberia has made substantial achievements in these fields. However, some fields of research are completely forbidden; or perhaps more accurately, in Iberia, those fields of research do not exist. \nTo do justice to the modern history behind this situation would require an entire encyclopedia’s worth of writing, so I will omit that here. However, bioengineering does exist in Iberia, or Weedy would not have been able to become an expert in the field at such a young age. Naturally, this was a result of her continuing her family’s research. \nAdmittedly, the above description makes it sound as if Weedy is seeking asylum in Rhodes Island to escape persecution, but this is actually a necessary background explanation based upon existing intelligence. \nWeedy joined Rhodes Island simply because she no longer wanted to stay in Iberia, and wished to see more of the world. According to her own account, there were virtually no barriers to her leaving, but she was also told that it would be significantly more difficult to return to Iberia - to which she had no particular sentiments. She received an offer from Rhodes Island shortly before receiving an offer from Rhine Lab. \nWeedy is not shy about mentioning her belief that Rhine Lab is better suited to her work than Rhodes Island is, but whenever this topic is brought up, she will tack on the phrase, “but I think Rhodes Island is pretty good too.”  \nOf course it is.

These guns, often awarded as part of a formal ceremony, fetch a very high price at the Scar Market, Kazdel’s infamous black market. W herself still has a number of these guns in her collection, but it was marked as contraband and confiscated following her onboarding in order to avoid arousing the ire of our Laterano operators. Among the many weapons she uses is an explosives-launching device with obvious signs of modification. As for its provenance... after thorough consideration, we decided to not investigate the matter further. \nFollowing the conclusion of the war, W accepted an offer from Talulah to fight for Reunion as a mercenary, thus becoming one of Reunion’s accomplices. Subsequently, W unilaterally broke off her cooperation with Reunion and reached an agreement with Rhodes Island that continues to this day. From the above, we most likely have no way of determining W’s specific role during the Kazdel Civil War, her motivation in joining and then quickly betraying Reunion, or her purpose in cooperating with Rhodes Island. We know nothing about her history from the onset of the Kazdel Civil War to the time she joined Reunion. Considering that W is still a mercenary, and also factoring in what she did during the incident with Reunion, we urge all ordinary operators to keep their distance from W as much as possible, and also urge all departments to exercise caution when dealing with these dangerous collaborators. \n[Classified Log]\nYou want an ordinary operator to keep tabs on W? Isn’t that asking too much? They'd lack critical information. But since we’re old acquaintances, why not let me take care of it? \nFine, fine. We should be thankful W rarely needs to stay aboard the landship. Everyone hates her as much as they fear her, but how could things be that simple? What I’m asking is: how complicated could she be? If you know what she used to be, you should know how to get along with these lunatics. Her skills are the real deal - otherwise, how would she have been able to pull all her mercenaries from Talulah? But don’t worry, even if she dared pull something on us, Dr. Kal’tsit would see right through it. \nStill, we should definitely keep our distance from her.

              "storyText": "Sarkaz mercenaries. Up until the final days of Kazdel’s Civil War, mercenaries were the most common armed forces seen in Kazdel’s barren lands. Each of them worked in small teams, sometimes being recruited by nobles with vast funds and supplies, other times forming spontaneous coalitions with other mercenary teams. In Kazdel, where allegiances shift like the sands and various groups frequently find themselves at each others’ throats, the concepts of life and death take on a different form than compared to any other region. For the soldiers mired in conflicts across the regions, becoming mercenaries has become an increasingly popular option.  In the history of modern warfare, the topic of “Sarkaz mercenaries” has always been a subject of intense debate. Some Sarkaz mercenaries were sponsored by someone outside of Kazdel who was both well-equipped and skilled in local strategic configurations, an alarming arrangement that posed a security challenge to all parties. As a result, professional forces dedicated to counteracting the Sarkaz mercenaries have been formed, though specific details are not yet available. \nAfter the incumbent regent clashed with the orthodox royal family to spark the civil war, the remnants of Kazdel’s army which had been scattered among various nobles began to gradually unite with civilian forces, eventually being split into factions. The fighting was brutal and harrowing, but some scholars believed that the Civil War allowed a new process of redistribution and restructuring to take root in the barren and chaotic Kazdel. Although the heirs of the orthodox royal family were expelled from Kazdel, they were still supported by various ancient clans and noble families who pitched their massive economic power into unifying a large number of mercenaries, effectively gathering these scattered warriors under a king’s banner. This event is considered to be the official start of the mercenaries’ prominent role in the Civil War. Shortly afterwards, the regent’s side returned fire and did the same. As a result, most mercenaries were brought under one of these major banners, which to some extent eroded the original meaning of the term, “mercenary.” Despite this, there still remain a small number of mercenaries who are unwilling to get shackled down to this unsurvivable conflagration, and still struggle to maintain an independent position between the two main groups. They believe that mercenaries, or rather, Sarkaz as a whole, should be free. Their deeds are widely circulated as legends among the civilians of Kazdel, albeit having been heavily embellished for artistic purposes. \n—”Struggle and Freedom” Chapter 2 - “Kazdel and the Modern History of Mercenaries,” excerpt. This book came from W’s personal belongings, and the author’s name is unexpectedly abbreviated to only the letter “H.” The sentence, “Sarkaz should be free,” is highlighted in red.",

Even her infrequent sightings on the ship are enough to cause quite an uproar. \nOne need not reiterate W’s nasty temperament, and aside from Dr. Kal’tsit and the Doctor, she considers few to be worth her attention. The last time W came back to the ship for debriefing, we almost had a brawl with two elite operators on our hands... the reason? W provoked them, of course. Even when there is no ill intent behind her words, her attitude alone is enough to incite conflict, particularly when it comes to the dead — including the ones she had something to do with! Truly, a Sarkaz who sheds neither blood nor tears! \nOh, right, regarding Amiya. \nAmiya does not seem to know much about W, and W, despite not considering Amiya to be particular noteworthy, will still defer to her. Isn’t that strange? We all think so. Despite her grumbling, complaints and tendency to disregard orders and act according to her own judgment, W has complied with Amiya’s orders, at least when it comes to reporting results. It’s as if... W has high expectations for Amiya, but I don’t think that’s a good thing. \nOne more thing - I’m not entirely sure if this is just my imagination, and the boss stops my observations—\nBut sometimes, W will stand in front of an empty room, unmoving... as if in a daze. Other times, she’ll just watch Amiya while she goes about her daily business. Yeah, just stare. \nWhat in the world could she be thinking? In the likely event that it’s something dangerous, we must take precautionary measures. \nImportantly... every time she was observed, she wasn’t smiling.",

              "storyText": "[Classified Log]\nDoctor, I'm sure you realized this as well, but there is some relationship between W and Rhodes Island... as well as with your past. \nWhen a Sarkaz like Flamebringer showed up at Rhodes Island, I knew this day would come. Miraculously, from Kazdel to Ursus, then to Lungmen to today, and maybe on into the future, we’ve continued to move forward, but we still meet the same people we started this journey with - only now, with the far-reaching effects they left behind. And once again, I have to come to terms with the fact that there are things in this life that we can't avoid, or run from. I talked to Ms. Kal’tsit and Amiya, and even brought a bunch of snacks to bribe Closure with - and everyone had a different opinion. \nI begged ■■■ to please let me talk to you, Doctor. Even though you might not recognize me anymore, I feel like I have to talk to you about something. You just have to keep thinking of me... as a Sarkaz boiler worker. \nI wanted to talk about W. I’ve known W for a long time. Did W mention this to you... while She was still alive? About Her Majesty. Us “old Operators” swore to never speak of this again, but it’s not because we’re trying to hide anything from you, Doctor. The reason is simple - none of us are willing to confront that past. Ms. Kal’tsit... also knows about this, of course. Hm? Don’t worry, I checked in with her before I came by. There are some things I can't do as thoroughly as she'd like, so I'm just here to have a little chat. \nBack to W - in the beginning, she was a kid, who only knew to follow Her Majesty’s orders, and nobody else’s. Even among the then-unified Sarkaz, not many people knew about W’s existence. What about Amiya, at the time? They wouldn't have met each other by then; after all, she had just enlisted as a mercenary. Unscrupulous, cynical, and flashing that devil-may-care smile. As for me, I was just a boiler worker at the time who had never seen a battlefield— huh? That's right, I built these muscles at work... I just got lucky and beat that elite operator at arm wrestling... I've never been on the battlefield. I don't know how extreme the soldiers thought W was, and I don't know why they thought she was unstable. I've never seen her in a fight, except she came back from a mission, trailing behind Her Majesty, thinking it's not her place to even say hello.  The way I see it, she was trying to follow Her Majesty. Following Her ideals, Her light, just like every Sarkaz before. \nBut W isn't that person anymore. There aren't very many people at Rhodes Island who know about W. But most of the people W knew are gone now. She wore her disguise... for too long, and it sank in too deep. She used to have some friends. Yes, even someone like her still needs the help and companionship of friends. They used to all fight alongside us, and though it wasn't for a very long time, if those friends were still here today, they might still be able to lend her a helping hand. Now, I'm thinking there isn't a single person is left who can help her. That's right, nothing we can do. Nothing you or Dr. Kal'tsit can do, and I'd get it if nobody wanted to do this anyway. But we shouldn't take that for granted. \nWe all want to know what W is after, and what her plans are. In her eyes, is Rhodes Island just a flash in the pan, or a brand new future to carry the hopes of the past? That's a very important question, maybe even more important to people still haunted by the past. That includes Amiya, and even Ms. Kal'tsit. It also matters to how W will handle her relationship with Rhodes Island in the coming days, as well as with Amiya, Ms. Kal'tsit, and even you. \nHm? Oh. There's a simple reason I came to see you. You might not remember the past, but the people from your past keep popping up, one by one. Some are trusting, some not so much, and I'm sure you must be having a hard time dealing with them... Haha, too bad I'm just a lowly boiler worker with no place to worry about the Doctor of Rhodes Island. \nMs. Kal'tsit and Amiya may be able to take good care of you, and also keep Rhodes Island in steady, continued operations. But W... is nothing like them. Whether she's coming at you, or the other way around, I just hope both of you can keep calm and don't be hasty. \nI wanted Amiya or Ms. Kal’tsit to tell you this stuff, or at least have it delivered by ■■■. Everyone gave up and let me do it, but truth be told, I'm also pretty nervous. \nI mean, I'm just your typical, run-of-the-mill Sarkaz. I can’t do crazy Arts or swing big swords and axes - if anything, I’d just drop them on my feet. The best I can do is to take care of my own work. All I hope... is that Rhodes Island can keep on trucking across the world, safely. \nHm? You have a question for me? Theresa? You... where’d you hear that name? \n... Theresa, huh? \nMaybe it won't be so long before you have to truly face your past.",

She may not have been gifted with great athleticism or combat acumen, but her tenacity coupled with the basic training she had received helped her quickly grow into a qualified operator. However, her lackadaisical attitude towards getting injured during training and exceedingly cavalier lifestyle habits are causes for concern. \nThe medical department’s assessment shows that Absinthe’s mental health markers are troubling; she views many issues with significant pessimism, and also displays degrees of self-loathing and self-destructive tendencies. This Ursus girl rarely seeks to establish personal agency in her daily life, instead subconsciously trying to help others around her. However, at the same time, she belittles her own actions to the point of even negating whatever results she may have achieved, a behavior that, in the eyes of the medic operators, is very concerning. \nAnother important issue to bring up is the strong concerns raised by the Ursus Student Self-government Group. Before joining Rhodes Island, Absinthe knew nothing about the members of the Self-government Group, and vice versa. It is unclear why Absinthe now pays so much attention to their activities, and she is unwilling to talk about the matter. These anomalous behaviors may have something to do with her past experiences in Peterheim Middle School. We can surmise that there must be some undiscovered facts regarding the time she spent there. \nUnder the premise that this status will not cause damage to Rhodes Island, related background investigations have been temporarily suspended out of respect for Operator Absinthe.",

Before Chernobog’s residents realized what was going on, much of the city had already been occupied. \nWe can reconstruct an account of what happened in the incident’s aftermath based upon oral narratives from survivors. Reunion’s leaders partitioned the city and controlled different zones, with certain zones being controlled more strictly than others. In certain places, people could remain unharmed as long as they stayed behind closed doors. But many citizens in other areas were not so lucky... You already know what I mean by that. Certain Reunion leaders encouraged the Infected to “claim their legitimate rights,” which is a euphemism for allowing gratuitous violence. When an excessively emotional catharsis morphs into hivemind behavior, one can imagine the kind of disaster that would ensue.  \nPolice? Compared to the sheer number of Infected who had given in to fanaticism, the amount of peace officers and military police simply was too small. While they were better equipped and trained than the average Reunion rioter, that alone was not sufficient, and the following Catastrophe tore through what little defenses were left in the city. The Chernobog police continued to send backup requests to the garrison during this time, but judging from the results, such attempts were futile. \n\nHow did that girl stay alive in those conditions until the time she was rescued? What kind of things did she have to go through? \nI won’t ask her to answer those questions. I can see that she’s doing well enough with us, and despite her doubts and anxieties, she’s making an effort to understand what happened in the past and shake off the lingering effects of those events. I even saw her trying to make friends, to try to be more inviting and to not push others away. This is no easy feat, and it is also a good sign. There’s no way we could heartlessly pry open those wounds. We all need to be more cautious and circumspect when dealing with people who have suffered through disasters.

After that, Rhodes Island operators will escort them to their chosen destinations so that they may start a new life. At the same time, some of the refugees will end up staying with Rhodes Island for a variety of reasons. \nAbsinthe’s parents were confirmed to have passed away during the Chernobog incident. When the logistics operator confirmed other kinship ties with Absinthe, the latter rejected the offer to be sent to another city and voluntarily applied to join Rhodes Island. Without a doubt, what she had experienced during the last month had driven her to make this decision. \nThe devastation wrought by Reunion’s occupation, the destruction caused by the Catastrophe, and the ugly face of today’s complex conflicts - all of these may have well played a role. As the turmoil continued, a shortage of food and drinking water turned these conflicts into something much simpler and more primal. Whether Infected or not, status mattered little when the only thing that remained was a cruel struggle for basic necessities. \n\nThe Medical Department has been closely monitoring the mental health of all survivors of the Chernobog-Lungmen incident. Unlike the members of the Ursus Student Self-Government Group who also escaped from Chernobog, Absinthe’s depression and pain takes on a much more direct manner. She rarely shows a real smile, and very few people are able to approach her. More often then not, Absinthe chooses to stay far away from others and maintain a subdued silence. Nevertheless, Absinthe has already helped many people; she may be taciturn, but she is undoubtedly reliable. Perhaps Absinthe views her own actions as trivial and insignificant, but we believe that kindness begets kindness and eagerly look forward to Absinthe’s future development. \nJust like the hair that she cut herself, perhaps only time can heal her scars.",

Yeah, we’ve been ‘ere for a few years, and heard something a couple years back. \nWhat the ‘ell’s going on with Victoria these days? Us folks have been dealing with Victorians for quite some time now, so we’ve seen things. Since the mining rush started, we’ve been seeing caravans carrying some odd gadgets. A few years ago, they suddenly stopped showin’ up, and we’d occasionally see people clad in common Victorian clothes collapsin’ by the side of the road. Often frail-lookin’ women, children, and the elderly too. Y’see, even a well-trained Messenger has to bring enough supplies, and wouldn’t dare set out without a vehicle. But you look at these people who can’t even get in a caravan, tryin’ to cross such a vast expanse outside of any jurisdiction. Who can manage something like that? \nDidn’t find out about this ‘til later, but apparently one of the boys on our town’s mining ship heard from somewhere that a number of years back, before the mining rush really picked up steam, a number of Victorian steam barons came by our mining towns to sign off some limited permits with the trade union. After these barons paid their dues, they extracted some ore, set up their factories when they got back, and made a small fortune. Naturally, power gathered in the hands of these people, and the industry grew bigger an’ bigger. Even a few small nomadic cities got built between the route from here to Victoria. But recently, the supply of ore dried up all of a sudden and nobody knew what was goin’ on. They sent a handful of prisoners who had been stripped of their rights to a site in Rim Billiton and had ‘em illegally snatch up the ore there. Our union here at Rim Billiton had its hands tied for a variety of reasons, and this situation continued until the “Cage Incident” broke out.\n—Transcript of a conversation at a mining town tavern in Rim Billiton",

Please rest assured, Victorian officials will know to hold their tongues regarding this matter. Or rather, I would infer that someone is currently pulling the strings behind the scenes to hand control of the autonomous precinct to Rim Billiton in the future. \nYes, and I fear that it is going all too well. The rushed implementation of the new ruling aristocrats’ short-sighted policies, the exile of criminalized political opposition, leaked news regarding hostages, the negligence towards the armed forces and domestic defense, and the laissez-faire nature of the Victorian government... have all set the stage for a brewing conflict. \nAmong these cases, an executive official’s handling of a political offender’s family created a particularly unreasonable hostage situation. Women and children were forced into cages under dilapidated facilities and sent to work in dark mine shafts, never to see the light of day in a way that was tantamount to murder. After news of this abhorrent practice broke, public outrage was inevitable. These new aristocrats, the visionary entrepreneurs who capitalized upon Rim Billiton’s mining craze, should never have allowed this to occur, let alone make such a stupid decision... unless the decision itself is part of a much larger transaction. \nRegardless, this is not a problem that can be solved by a former clerk who was reduced to a “bandit” after being persecuted and jailed for participating in a union protest against their radical pact. But I do have some other ideas, namely about the talent referrals that your company mentioned in the past. \nPresumably your company has done some research beforehand, and it should be clear that in this incident, the kindness and enthusiasm of Rim Billiton’s workers played a vital role. Though some may have their suspicions, these virtues are not eclipsed by those who had ulterior motives in mind. I do have a recommendation in fact - his professionalism may have been critical to this incident, and he is praised by many as a hero who dove “into the cages” in a daring operation to liberate those trapped underground. However, this may not necessarily be a good thing for him. The officials who passed down these barbaric laws were not entirely snuffed out by the angry mobs in the clashes that followed, so I cannot guarantee that there are no survivors out there who still harbor a deep resentment. Although they no longer have any influence over the autonomous prefecture, nor can they seek to ambush the steam power-equipped mining teams of Rim Billiton, it would not be impossible for them to lie in ambush in the outskirts, waiting to attack a lone Catastrophe Messenger who travels with only one bodyguard. In fact, there have been cases of such attacks over the last two years. \nAlthough we tried to persuade this individual to stay within the city and leave the data collection to others, he was even more adamant in requesting missions that would send him away from relative safety. Perhaps he is well aware of our intentions and does not want to run the risk of getting people in the city involved. But does he really have this kind of self-destructive thinking? ...I hope he has a more optimistic outlook. You see, he is the kind of person who is always ready and willing to accept new things, and is never content to languish in the same environment for too long. In any case, entrusting him to you should be the right course of action. Take him - or perhaps, accompany him - to see the vastness of Terra, and more.” \n—Transcript of a conversation at an official residence in the Eureka Autonomous Prefecture",

Though the desire to explore the frozen tundra was her own, the core reason she undertook her exploration had a great deal to do with Rhine Lab. Additionally, Magallan’s exploration was better planned and thoroughly measured. \nOn the other hand, Asbestos’s exploration is completely amateur - nobody asked her to do it, and nobody is backing her financially. She merely follows her own ideas, walking around and recording her observations in her travel notes and publishing them in magazines. \nIn fact, almost all active explorers on Terra are affiliated with either some country or company, such as Magallan is, and explorers with no backing, such as Asbestos, are very rare. Realistically speaking, a desire to explore the world cannot be fulfilled solely through courage, but requires capital as well. \nThough Asbestos is reluctant to reveal her background, we can surmise that there’s likely nothing exceedingly bad or traumatic. As for why she decided to become a maverick explorer, Rhodes Island does not intend to pry too much. That is to say, on this point, she differs greatly from Magallan. \nAs for the differences in their views on exploration, Asbestos claims that she’s just “in it for the excitement.” While it is true that when we mention explorers, we often have an impression of them as being pioneers, trailblazers, delvers into the unknown, or torchbearers for those who come after them, etc., none of these are substantively different. \n“Opening the way for those in the future” is generally the result rather than the cause. For example, while Magallan has always wanted to be an explorer, that desire fundamentally stems from her longing for the frozen tundra. Rather, those who try to act out of one of these clichéd ideals of righteousness usually end up giving up halfway through. \nFrom the footprints that Asbestos has left and the records she has taken, there is no doubt that she is an excellent explorer.",

As a matter of fact, she even revels in that animus, especially when people say it to her face. She understands that the true way to alienate others is not to rudely refuse, but rather to be calculatingly evasive, or to be ambivalent. \nRather than saying she doesn’t understand interpersonal relationships, it’s more accurate to say that she sees them far too thoroughly and hasn’t chosen not to maintain certain norms after recognizing all of this. \nLike Magallan, she knows how to endure loneliness, but a major difference is, one of Magallan’s greatest motivating factors is the fact that someone is waiting for her. Asbestos, however, has no need for such motivation, nor is she trying to compensate for that with something else. She simply has learned to draw her motivation from other things. \nIt’s little wonder that some operators think she’s very cool. She’s willing to bear the consequences of her decisions, alone. \nEven though we have no way of finding out about her past without her cooperation, based upon the result, she claims to actively want to be a “jerk” that antagonizes everyone, and is intent on staying that way until the end of her life. \nIt is not for us to judge whether her lifestyle is correct, nor do we expect her to change.

According to Provence, there is a vast communication network among Catastrophe Messengers that spans national borders. Through this network, many people are able to pick up the mantle of Catastrophe Messenger, and it also provides a source of employment for those who are unable to hold steady employment. Tsukinogi is a clear example of the efficiency of this network. Without a hub of communication and information exchange, there is no way that someone in Higashi could connect with Rhodes Island thousands of miles away using a conventional messenger. In any case, she is now with us, acquainting herself with her new environment, building relationships, and dealing with everything related to Catastrophes as usual.",

When she has free time, she often goes to the dance room to relax or to teach. While her moves are gentle and agile, flourishing her hands through the air, her feet barely make any noise. As long as she is willing, she can happily spend an entire afternoon with someone with even no dance experience, making them feel as if the two are dancing in harmony. She is familiar with most dance styles from both Higashi and Yan, and is very experienced with the ceremonial Kagura dances. However, this is the one type of dance that she refuses to do. According to HR personnel, her reason for this stems from her belief that Kagura dances are antiquated and dull, and only serve to blaspheme the gods while also making the dancers unhappy.  Given Tsukinogi's usually gentle words and demeanor, her strong beliefs in this matter are all the more convincing and are perhaps related to her unwillingness to become a shrine maiden.",

With her mysterious rhetoric, a few simple Originium Arts techniques, and her charming personality, there are many people willing to go out of their way to accommodate her. As a result of almost universal praise and adoration, Tsukinogi naturally was painted with an aura of benevolence, and was able to establish a vast relationship network. Of course, unlike people who network for the sake of money or benefits, Tsukinogi embraced an altruistic and dedicated approach to dealing with others. This was, after all, the reason she became a Catastrophe Messenger in the first place, and is also the reason why her initial probation period was half the duration of most other operators. The operator who compiled Tsukinogi's file was originally distressed about the fact that the Doctor had been keeping secrets regarding Tsukinogi's past, but after talking with Tsukinogi, that operator has since become a firm supporter. By the looks of things, she is better than most Catastrophe Messengers at earning the trust of others. \nAs for this trust, Tsukinogi credits all of it to the Doctor.",

Many nobles who saw the writing on the walls have been trying to convert their land and possessions into financial capital. \nHowever, in more baroque countries such as Ursus, change has been slow and painful. At least before the Great Rebellion, the aristocratic ruling class still controlled the right to speech. Had it not been for a certain incident, Ursus’s political structure might not have shifted at all. \nAccording to Rosa’s description, the Rostov family she belonged to was one of the new nobility that arose after the Great Rebellion, inheriting everything from a certain Count that they had served under. \nCount Boris, the mayor of Chernobog, was also one of these upstarts. The two families quickly got on good terms, running businesses throughout Chernobog either openly or in secret.

The date coincided with the time when Mephisto began to move, in the event now known as the Chernobog incident;\nAfter seizing control of the schools, Mephisto did not interfere with the students’ actions within the schools, but would not permit them to leave. From the perspective of outside observers, he intended to exacerbate the brewing anxiety of the students. This ugly behavior is consistent with our perception of him;\nThe time Reunion relaxed their control over the schools corresponded with the time Amiya encountered Mephisto during the mission to rescue the Doctor. Amiya believes that Mephisto received information regarding Rhodes Island’s movements and left the schools unsupervised because he had already seen what he wanted to see after setting tragedy into motion;\nThe Peterheim Middle School she described does exist in Chernobog, close to the place where they were rescued, in a block not directly struck by the Catastrophe. \netc, etc. \nAfter considering various factors, we can only conclude that what Rosa described indeed occurred within an event as tragic as the Chernobog incident. \nAs for the experiences of the other members of the Self-government Group during this tragedy, Rosa said that she didn’t know much because she joined the group late, but she also made it clear that she was unwilling to speak on their behalf. Rosa will take the initiative to speak about her experiences. On one hand, this is a manifestation of her trust in Rhodes Island and in the Doctor; but on the other hand, she fears that among the members of the Self-government Group, she is the most appropriate person to “betray” the others and break the silence.

It is absolutely impossible for a pure-blooded Ursus aristocrat who has been nurtured at length with an elite education to simply join an organization like Rhodes Island. These nobles sit atop their ivory thrones, governing wealth and land high above the reaches of suffering. \n\nAfter Rosa officially started working with the Logistics Department, she undeniably did act like she was “trying to seem less like an aristocrat.” One can tell that she is still not accustomed to lowering her position, but she is legitimately trying to adapt to such a life. \nWhy? Because a vast majority of people, Infected or non-Infected, harbor no love for nobles - and particularly not Ursus nobles. \nHowever, Rosa no longer pays any heed to the position she once came from. She bore the burden of contempt in silence, only occasionally smiling and shaking her head - however, she never let that get in the way of her work. \n“No person should be judged because of where they came from,” said Istina as she stood in front of Rosa, shielding her from an outraged Ursus operator. \nWe agree that nothing like that should never be allowed to happen in Rhodes Island, ever. The same is true for Amiya, and the same is true for that operator who later apologized to Rosa. \nRosa, her frankness, her self-reproach, her confusion... was certainly not a novel case when she joined Rhodes Island. \n\nToday is yet another day upon Terra.",

Podenco has been interested in a variety of plants since a young age, likes to make dried flowers, and also tended a small nursery back home. As she grew up, she became involved in the community’s farming efforts, gaining rich experience in botanical cultivation for plants both edible and ornamental. When asked which type of plants she prefers, Podenco will quietly tell you that she likes flowers more, but when food and clothing become a scarcity, she will silently stash away her personal preferences deep into her heart.",

She couldn’t wait to find some place filled with fragrance and beauty, and soon after, she bumped into Perfumer in the middle of the street. Perfumer immediately noticed Podenco’s fondness for flowers, and her own Garden happened to be short of the personnel needed to make her aromatherapy raw materials. And just like that, Podenco ran into someone by mistake, and landed herself the first job of her life. \nCompared to Perfumer, Podenco still is lacking in many ways. Her sense of smell isn’t as sensitive as Perfumer’s, nor does she have any knowledge of auxiliary professions, but she is quickly approaching Perfumer’s skill with the momentum she has. From a single flower, to a garden, and now to an entire greenhouse, Podenco has the skill to independently manage the Convalescent Garden. In addition, she also began to use the flowers she collected to create a wide variety of reagents, constantly adapting to meet the demands of the various medics in the medical facility. In time, she may well become the world’s undisputed master of horticulture. \nAnd it all stems from her love for flowers. \nA lifelong love.",

While he firmly believed that what he did brought succor to the people, he clung onto selfish hopes that his daughter could have a broader, freer future. As such, Suzuran was secretly taken to Siracusa by her mother, but the peaceful times did not last long. Her mother’s family was involved in a bout of civil unrest against the ■■■■ family.

This maintenance process usually involves multiple steps such as wiping them down with a fine cloth, applying essential oils, soft brush care, and polish. Beeswax always completes each step meticulously, ensuring that nothing is omitted. Through her persistent effort, her horns have achieved a remarkable state of lustre, shape, and hardness. \nThrough our inquiries with other Caprinae operators, we have established that even by Caprinae standards, Beeswax’s horns are magnificent, a rare and beautiful sight to behold. \nAfter finishing her daily care, Beeswax often provides help to operators who need it, making her very popular within certain small circles.",

In Beeswax's tribe, it is not unusual for young members of the tribe to go on journeys to the outside world and bring back what they see. Because these journeys have become traditions in their own rights, this particular tribe is unlike many others in that it does not totally reject novel things from the outside. \nIn addition to these journeys, one or two veteran Messengers may visit each year at certain times to bring the latest news to clan members, including the most recent music magazines. \nBeeswax does not appear to be someone who is incredibly shrewd; rather, she is straightforward and easy to understand. She loves music as well. When she left home, she brought with her a number of magazines issued by the Music Society, and these new publications became quite popular among the Caster teams. Even Beeswax herself quick integrated, smoothly establishing good relationships with the other operators. \nThough Beeswax doesn’t talk much, is quiet most of the time, and tends to lose her train of thought, by no means is she simple-minded. In choosing to officially become an Operator of Rhodes Island, Beeswax did not rush to her decision, but had to weigh a variety of considerations. \nThe fact that she chose to stay to wait for her relative, while certainly her primary reason, is only one of several considerations. After a bit of inquiry, we determined that Beeswax believes that her time at Rhodes Island will serve as valuable experience to help her pass her tribe’s rites of passage to adulthood— or rather, she sees working with Rhodes Island as one rung of that trial. \nAfter comprehensive deliberation, we also saw no reason to deny the participation of a talented and powerful Caster. On one hand, the addition of Beeswax is beneficial to us. On the other hand, we believe that such an option will help Beeswax as well, and Rhodes Island will be able to provide her with many further opportunities to understand this land. \n\nAs an addendum, the young Caprinae waited for several months before picking out her official code name.

Therefore, it is totally understandable that she would trust her work partner more than others. \nHowever, Closure said one day that “it’s better to have someone who can talk with you,” and before Scene could refuse, Closure transformed Lens into a talking photography assistant. \nAccording to Closure, Lens stands out from the crowd. “It contains the previous generation of Raythean Industries’ auxiliary AI.

What is Raythean Industries doing anyway? Even if  these have been discontinued, you can't just go around selling off stuff like this.

Perhaps its built-in thinking loop actually functions like this, but this quality was put on full display after the installation of a sound device.

In the face of the somewhat complicated political situation in Sargon, this kind of decision seems almost natural to some operators. \nScene herself also doesn’t seem to mind.

This means that Scene may be involved in battle, and possibly even lose her life. \nBut she didn’t let that dissuade her. Lens is very proud to say that the places they’ve been to have been far worse than what people in Rhodes Island can imagine, and the dangers they’ve encountered are far more terrifying than what they now are dealing with. \nWhile Scene may have already honed her skills and be able to calmly face the doubts of others, another interpretation is that she might just be very dedicated to her trade.

His main job was to protect Leonhardt from harm during his investigations and assessments of Catastrophes. Combined with Leonhardt’s cleverness, the duo rarely run into sticky situations. Most of the time, Ayerscarpe only needs to accompany him on walks, help carry equipment, or listen to his friend’s incessantly prattling about what he thinks is cool — at least until the moment when a crisis comes and he is required to perform his duties.  \nThere are many ways for a bodyguard to protect his target. Some people prefer using defensive measures to mitigate the damage, others are good at arranging traps to deter an enemy’s attack. However, Ayerscarpe’s preferred method of defense is to eradicate the enemies. Though he is a man of few words, his ferocious attacks indeed confirm his status as an operator who believes that the best defense is a good offense.",

However, the operator himself is well-suited for carrying out his duties in this manner. In addition to having excellent combat skills and rapid reaction times, part of this operator’s success is owed to the special weapon that he carries. \nThere has been no official name given to this weapon as of yet, and the nicknames that the operator himself has chosen, such as “my baby,” or “nice guy,” have no reference value whatsoever. Due to the operating mode of the weapon itself, we’ve temporarily named it “RT-01.” \nSince there is no weapon or even weapon class similar to RT-01 within our scope of knowledge, we believe that this is an experimental weapon. According to Ayerscape, this weapon was purchased from Rim Billiton’s black market. Rim Billiton has developed many small-scale private mining companies due to its robust mining industry. The turnover and conglomeration rate among these companies are high, which indirectly promotes the black market. Many resources will circulate here before eventually reaching the hands of private individuals, organizations, or even foreign forces. Because Ayerscarpe overcame great difficulties to acquire this weapon, and the weapon itself boasts excellent performance, he is extremely fond of RT-01. When asked to describe any deficiencies, he’ll only point out that it “produces some slight noise from time to time.” \nThe operator in charge of weapon inspections said he didn’t hear anything, but Ayerscarpe insists that he hears it loud and clear.",

Leonhardt takes on jobs that require negotiation or involve minerals, and Ayerscarpe takes on tasks that require superior athleticism or uncovering things that can’t be discovered by others. Don’t be fooled by the fact that he often exchanges harsh words with his old friend — he will never make Leonhardt look bad in front of others, and if something ever happens to him, he is the first to rush over. When Leonhardt became a Catastrophe Messenger, Ayerscarpe volunteered to become Leonhardt’s private bodyguard. Since Ayerscarpe acquired his unique set of weapons, it would be more profitable to take on jobs of his own rather than protecting the Catastrophe Messenger, but Ayerscarpe stubbornly insists on remaining his friend’s bodyguard, while also making it clear that the other party needs to pay up. All in all, Leonhard, not wealthy in the first place, ended up allocating most of his salary to Ayerscarpe, ending up in an even tighter financial situation as a result. \nAlthough we didn’t know how Ayerscarpe controlled these funds before, we were able to investigate the flow of funds between the two after he became an operator, and the results were mind-blowing. \nLeonhardt’s concept of managing money is rather laissez-faire. While he is good at making money, he’s also good at spending it. After joining Rhodes Island, his shopping list grew longer than ever due to stable living arrangements and a higher salary. Except for work-related tools such as dune buggies, which have questionable usability in general circumstances, Leonhardt’s stash of new and interesting things has indeed been growing. Most of these items simply reflect his personal taste, but others are for gifting to young operators who he deems to “not be cool enough,” and he often offers these gifts in a way that is hard to refuse. Sometimes, his consumption habits have caused been problematic, such as when he couldn’t pay the bills one time. This time, he has had Ayerscarpe to cover for him.\nAyerscarpe’s lifestyle has always been very frugal. Other than spending money on necessary living expenses and salted edamame, Ayerscarpe has been saving his money, and he basically returns the “payment” he received from serving as Leonhardt’s bodyguard to his friend at the right time. He knows that Leonhardt doesn’t know how to save money, and he knows that sooner or later, he wouldn’t be able to purchase something that he actually needed. At that time, he’ll use that money to buy things for his friend and send it over to him. Even now when there is no direct financial connection between the two, he still often draws from his savings to fill in the gap for Leonhardt. Of course, he also knows that Leonhardt will repay him in due time. This is the mutual understanding formed after many years of cooperation, and demonstrates the trust between the two friends.",

There’s no need for that. Saria couldn’t see eye-to-eye about the way certain departments in Rhine Lab did things, but she wouldn’t do anything about these weapon owners.” \n“Our biggest fear is that Rhine Lab will use the signal transmitter to take control of the device and do something unspeakable.” \n“Since we found out about it, it should be fine now that we’ve destroyed it.” \n“As for what Rhine Lab will do with the data they obtained, will they find another target to experiment upon, or will they create the hatchet that can slay a god?” \n“So, what does this have to do with Rhodes Island?” \n—Unknown time, Rhodes Island, unidentified surveillance recording",

But in fact, what most operators want from medics is just a convenient method to feel better, and not all operators have the luxury of emulating Folinic’s lifestyle, namely getting up at 6 every morning and being in bed by 9, running around the deck for an hour every morning, then showering and eating before heading to work. Not to mention, Folinic also doesn’t touch tobacco or alcohol, doesn’t party, only socializes as necessary, and spends the rest of her time in a research lab, clinic, or library to improve herself. Only on weekends does she take a day to satisfy her interests in hunting. For most operators, such a spartan lifestyle is... out of the question. \nBut what is behind this borderline ascetic way of life? Does Folinic really do all this so that she can get a sound night of sleep? According to some operators who have worked with Folinic, “her present must be kept busy to the brim, or she will relapse to the terrible events of the past.” Specifically, “if she doesn’t exhaust herself during the day, she won’t be able to sleep at night. ”",

Though she had an interest in hunting and was capable of conducting a hunt in the wild and returning safely, she still had too much to learn as a combat operator. After the Chernobog incident, Folinic made a request to Kal'tsit in hopes that she could make the preparations to transition into a combat operator as quickly as possible, or at least, that Kal'tsit would allow her to join the battlefield as a combat medic or provisional physician. After Folinic took her physical fitness evaluation, Kal'tsit agreed to her request and had Folinic join the reserve operator training camp, where she trained with the other reserve operators. After half a year, Folinic completed her preparatory training and officially joined Rhodes Island’s outpost operation team. Folinic considered many ways she could offer her support; she could try to become a sniper, or she could balance her work as a medic and guard; but in the end, she decided to become a combat medic and continue to prioritize medical assistance. However, in her half-year of combat training, she realized that most medics were quite frail and had no combat capabilities once they lost the protection of their comrades. To overcome this, Folinic used her pharmacological knowledge to carefully formulate a number of reagents commonly found in readily-available drugs to treat external injuries. With minor modifications such as increasing the dosage or mixing in different compounds, these drugs could become potent toxins that could incapacitate targets in a very short time. She has stepped out onto the battlefield many times and incapacitated many enemies. We don’t know how she feels about her new role as someone who is supposed to do no harm, but when she’s facing an enemy, her anger is evident enough to anyone who sees her.",

Her anger and resentment are not directed at individuals, but rather at the vast political entity that is the “Ursus Empire.” As a Feline living in Ursus, Folinic used to live under abhorrent conditions, so bad that all she could do was pursue a single full meal each day. After she followed her mother to Chernobog due to her job, Folinic naively thought that she was about to enjoy a better life. After all, her life was secure, she had met many people and among them, many were willing to reach out to her or teach her. Kal'tsit was one of those people. Subsequently, she said to her mother on just another ordinary day, “I’ll wait until you’re back to cook dinner.” But on that day, everything disappeared - her family and her friends, all gone without a trace. Only Kal'tsit, her mentor and the woman who would effectively become her only relative, rescued her from peril and entrusted her to an ordinary family in Chernobog. From sparse evidence and clues, Folinic pieced together the real cause of her mother’s death - Ursus. From that point on, she began to dig deeper, to learn, recognize, understand, and internalize every aspect of what kind of country Ursus is, and each bit of knowledge only further fanned the flames of her anger. Finally, right before Reunion made their move when Folinic was about to finish her studies, she met with Kal'tsit once more and expressed her desire to follow her. Even though Folinic was grateful towards her adoptive parents, she realized that she could never forgive the Ursus Empire to the point where she did not want to spend another second within its confines. Now, if she could call any place home, she would definitely say:\n“My home will always be wherever Dr. Kal'tsit is. ”",

For Thorns, others’ perceptions of him are ultimately inconsequential, and the way the outside world evaluates him has no effect upon him. \n\nThorns often delves deeply into the extraction and preparation of medicinals and ends up ignoring other things in the process — such as his own outward appearance. Forgetting to wear a jacket, having one trouser leg rolled up, wearing clothes with holes in them, and even wearing things backwards or insides out — all of these are commonplace occurrences. If you encounter Thorns in the hallway displaying one of these features, don’t read too much into it. \nFor a swordsman who pursues precision and efficiency, it isn’t worthwhile to spend too much time maintaining one’s appearance.

This swift and precise technique is widely known throughout Iberia as the “Destreza.” \nThe mainstay weapons of the Iberian region have always been swords and knives, with a wide variety of techniques spread across the land. However, the technique known as the “Destreza” is not accessible to everyone. Needless to say, this technique requires excellent physical fitness, but it also has extremely demanding requirements for the user’s mind. These strict requirements make the technique very difficult to learn, but if mastered, the rewards are great. \nAt the same time, many traditional Iberian blademasters believe that “Destreza” can only be used to describe swordsmanship using a standardized subset of weapons; and in their eyes, the styles used by non-Liberis, including Thorns, are nothing but clumsy and blasphemous imitations. However, according to Thorns, those people have absorbed more than enough of the technique’s framework and apply them in a more realistic manner. On this basis, there are no issues with considering them as users of “Destreza.” In other words, people who fight over semantics will quickly perish when they have to actually cross swords. After, they would not be exclusively facing swordsmen. \nHowever, even these renegade swordsmen will readily admit that Iberian swordsmanship is as vast and as dangerous as the ocean. No swordsman may ever exhaust that knowledge within his lifetime; not to mention, that lifetime is generally very short as well. \n\nIn any case, by combining the precise swordsmanship he has mastered with the deadly poisons he concocted himself, Thorns will always complete his missions upon the battlefield with efficiency and ease, ensuring optimal results while keeping losses minimal. \nHis method of operating is beyond reproach in terms of efficiency; however, in many situations, Thorns himself ends up garnering criticism. \nThorns’ swordsmanship and his pharmacological knowledge were learned from a local priest. He and several other children studied under the priest, following him through childhood and adolescence. Because this priest became involved in the religious turmoil that would later break out, several of his students have taken divergent paths. \nThorns is exceptionally skilled at swordsmanship, and also exhibits extraordinary talents in pharmacology. He is particularly skilled at extracting and purifying drug compounds, especially toxins. The precise efficacy of some of the neurotoxins he’s produced has been praised by the members of the Medical Department. In addition, Thorns always has bolder ideas when it comes to refining other reagents; and while his experiments do sometimes yield positive results, they end with an explosion more often than not. \nEven in the face of failure, Thorns always seems to enjoy himself.",

An operator’s profile overview can only be completed by synthesizing all of the available information. \nThrough these investigations, we’ve noticed that the personalities of the operators who come to Rhodes Island are almost always complex and multifaceted, almost impossible to reduce down to a list of simple traits, and never exactly the same between two operators. Of course, Thorns is no exception. \nMany people who’ve been in contact with Thorns will describe him as “difficult to get along with.” While these evaluations seem to reflect poorly upon him, further investigation revealed that many of the operators who gave him these negative evaluations still maintain frequent and friendly interactions with him. Those who are able to see more and more of Thorns's flaws are, conversely, closer to him and have a deeper relationship. \nWhile people complain that Thorns is “difficult to get along with,” they still make the effort to do so.

Particularly the gun she is never seen without. \nWhen she first joined Rhodes Island, her weapon perplexed many of our operators who were familiar with guns— Questions such as: \"She’s a Lateranan who looks like an Iberian?\" \"Did she rob a Lateranan? Such a badass?\" \"Iberians can use guns too?\" swirled around endlessly. After all, Blacksteel’s guns are assumed to be some kind of corporate secret, but a non-Laterano freelance mercenary strutting around with a huge gun gets people talking. \nOf course, everything becomes clear once you see her shoot an inkball out of that thing. Apparently, it’s a modified crossbow made to look like a gun. Because Andreana is a committed firearms enthusiast. \nAccording to her, Laterano culture has had a strong influence on the Iberians, who often display an affection for it. After seeing one of the statues in church as a child, Andreana fell in love with the weapons, and devoted herself to mechanical engineering in hopes of making a crossbow in the style of a gun, since she lacks the affinity for Originium Arts necessary to use a real one herself. \nBut there is a point here worth examining, and one Andreana herself did not realize. She mentioned that she was dragged into court over the weapon several times, only to be chastised when it became clear it was not a real gun. That seems reasonable. But with the limited information we have, the Iberian courts should be very powerful. And for such an organization to grab her “several times” for something known to be harmless the first time indicates that they may have been using it as a pretense to find something else. \nHowever, since we lack reliable intelligence about the internal politics of a country closed so long to outsiders, we are not able to form any concrete judgments about the situation. And since, at least according to Andreana herself, she has not been harmed or unnecessarily interrogated, we leave the matter to speculation.",

During a brawl that was disguised as a case of school bullying, gang members who were even younger than Aciddrop sprinkled Originium dust onto her.",

Tomimi has little knowledge of life outside her tribe. Her impressions of the outside world come entirely from her conversation with Inam and from the books that were commissioned. When she first came to Rhodes Island, she was the same as two other operators, making a variety of common sense blunders during her trial-and-error phase. However, she quickly completed her transition thanks to her adaptability, and transformed from the leader of a small tribe on the border of Sargon into a Caster Operator with a unique personal flair. \nWhen Tomimi first applied to become an operator, some of the other operators in charge of the testing process initially were opposed to letting her become a Caster. In the eyes of Casters who have been trained under the theoretical framework of modern Originium Arts, Tomimi’s use of Originium Arts is brutish and backwards, particularly her preference towards melee combat which runs contrary to what is typically required of Casters. When the testers gathered around to discuss their opinions, one interesting question was front and foremost:\n“What’s the difference between her and Gavial?” \n“Gavial wouldn’t actually force people.” \n“I think that’s only because she’s too busy.” \n“But ultimately, they decided to let Tomimi become a Caster, and in terms of her training policy, they did not ask her to conform to the standards of modern Casters and instead allowed her to implement her own fighting style. The reason is, after observing Tomimi’s fighting style, they determined that there was some value in studying it. “Injecting” your own Arts into a wand in order to fill it with lethal power is, from a certain perspective, an utterly fanciful notion. Casters themselves tend to be intellectually curious people as well. After acknowledging Tomimi’s combat abilities, a small group of Casters adopted the belief that “Casters ought to be physically strong.” They even began to hope that a new school of Originium Arts would form through Tomimi’s growth— Of course, even if this was to succeed, that’ll be some time in the future.",

If you put yourself in her shoes though, Tomimi becoming like this may have been inevitable. Pretend that there’s a beautiful young girl. Outside, she’s the queen of the playground, and not even the adults can handle her. Everyone wants to be her friend, but she’s always at your doorstep, sharing meals with you and asking you to play, showering you with her geniality and grace— What kind of person wouldn’t be moved?! Furthermore, this wonderful young girl was stabbed by Originium in the mines in order to protect Tomimi, and ended up contracting Oripathy because of it. Even the bestselling authors of Columbia dare not write such heart-wrenching passages lightly, but this is not a work of fiction. It is Tomimi’s truth, and that is why she is so devoted to Gavial. After that, Tomimi dedicated herself to attending Gavial, though the latter mistook this as “exclusion.” After violently beating down all challengers at the Mahuizzotia, Gavial left the tribe. As for what happened afterwards, please refer to the reports from relevant individuals following Gavial’s return from her hometown in Sargon. According to the report summary, the reason why Tomimi thought of using a rocket launcher to shoot down the Doctor’s aircraft may simply have been because she hadn’t seen Gavial in a long time, nothing more. Tomimi has not pulled any crazy stunts like this since coming to Rhodes Island with Gavial. \n\n“My word, is there really no need to publish a book on Tomimi’s antics? A movie would do fine too.

After waffling around for quite some time, Tomimi brought out a number of books that had titles such as these:\n“Only One Step Until The New You”, “You’re a Winner”, “Learn Business Management in 100 Days”...\nThen, she took out a list of books that often appeared on the bestseller lists of bookstores, mostly related to fashion, self-help, and management. Without a doubt, the contents of these books gave Tomimi some dubious directions when it came to her understanding of the real world. For example... she really tried to apply this corporate management system to the members of the “Gavial’s Will” tribe, demanding that everyone wear a uniform, shout slogans, and fight like a Lupo (note that she had no idea what a Lupo was prior to joining Rhodes Island). Though the tribe had no complaints due to Tomimi’s abilities, after she left, everyone in the tribe quickly lapsed into their old, comfortable ways. With this in mind, the rocket launcher incident was probably inspired by one of these books. \nFortunately, Tomimi was able to pick up a number of practical life skills. She is already familiar with storing items in a limited space, an ability that has earned her the praise of dorm staff. In addition, she is proficient in the use of expedition tools, able to explore the wilds without assistance. Nor will she ever again make the mistake of getting trapped in a mine by accident and putting herself in danger. However, Rhodes Island is different from the hometown of her Acahualla tribe. Gone is the near-infinite space she had back there to store her various collectibles. Under Gavial’s persuasion, she has begun to screen her treasures, keeping only the most valuable things in a backpack that she carries on her person. \nAll things considered, one cannot say that Tomimi is unintelligent, but rather, all her energy goes into the wrong areas.",

The dispute betwen “thick tails” and “fine tails” still continues to this day. \nTomimi isn’t invested in this issue and is perfectly fine with whatever size or length tail she may have, and Gavial is also in agreement. \nNevertheless, her tail is a bit heavy, and sometimes causes inconveniences in day-to-day life. Upon the Doctor’s recommendation, Tomimi finally decided to use a tail clamp made especially for Archosaurus use. \nPeople often hear Tomimi lamenting: “When I was little, my tail was the same thickness as Gavial’s. Why’d it end up growing so much more?” \nTomimi couldn’t decide whether to keep her tail as it is or to grit her teeth and trim down on it. \nOn one hand, a thick tail is quite popular and can even bring some unexpected benefits on the battlefield.

The tribe of Liberi she comes from is naturally of small stature, and it’s apparent that their physical fitness compared to other Liberi falls slightly short. One need not even start comparing them to the wealth of combative, healthily robust races surrounding them. This is why Flint’s tribe has always had a relatively tough time living in the rainforest. These challenges persisted up until Flint reached the age where she could run and jump, at which point she promptly picked and won a fight with two Archosauria who substantially outclassed her. She beat them on their own ground. \nFlint’s fists are fast and tricky. Where she falls short in terms of naturally endowed strength, her race’s superiority in speed makes up handily for the deficiency. Her fighting style differs from any boxer with a grounding in theory. She wields her fists to knock her opponent down, pure and simple, and they carry an almost illusory sense of the freedom and danger of the rainforest. \nAs the tallest and strongest warrior in her tribe, Flint was always quite confident of her own build, even proud of it, until she came into contact with other, much taller peoples. Once she came to the realization that most of the entire outside world’s population was of much greater stature than her, Flint was quick to give up her arrogance born of ignorance, and she began seeking out new challenges. She went to find those stronger than herself, challenge them, harden and mold herself, improve herself, until she could beat them. \nDo not underestimate her for her size. No Sargon warrior ever feared a challenge. \n\n[Addendum by file author]\nI will refrain from putting her relationship with the taller operators into words. On the other hand, she gets along with our operators of Durin origin. No question about that.",

But we must admit their conduct is full of great fervor, candor and a masterful valor. Operator Flint is an archetypal example of this. \nAs Flint sees it, there is nothing that can’t be settled with her fists some way or another. Back in Flint’s old stomping grounds, you’d often catch a glimpse of Tiacauh people who’d been wrestling with each other just a moment ago, who’d stood themselves up straight, shook hands and made peace with each other the very next second. After that handshake, they might wrap their arms around each other’s shoulders and go off to eat together. Though, generally, they’ll get into another fight because of something else altogether before they can sit down. \nIn addition, the Liberi people to which Flint belongs have a love for flowers that far exceeds the norm. Their preference is especially for lushly colored specimens, which can be often found adorning their homes. Operator Flint holds the fundamental notion that flowers are something found everywhere, and freely pickable as one wishes. Even now, living in Rhodes Island’s colossus of rebar and iron sheeting, she continues to think so. \nAs Miss Perfumer’s greenhouse steadily drew in the horticulture enthusiasts one after another, a great mystery reared its head. Flowers would often be picked without warning. As the days went on, the gardeners whose plants went missing ultimately formed an alliance, agreeing once and for all to teach the delinquent flower-picker a lesson they’d never forget. \nBefore they set out a real action plan, Operator Flamebringer’s meticulously cultivated bonsai was burgled overnight—a crucial breakthrough. The concerned parties fought each other bitterly that next day, and finally, under the oppressive gaze of Dr. Gavial, they reluctantly shook hands and made their own peace. \n\nAt least Operator Flint now understands. Unlike the rainforest, abundant with vegetation, she should refrain from picking the flowers she finds growing within Rhodes Island. The greenhouse’s keeper has allowed Flint the use of a small flowerbed. You can find the Tiacauh stooping next to it from time to time, her hands, so often closed in fists, carefully pulling the weeds, looking forward to seeing the flowers bloom.",

Of course, Lancet-2 is fairly popular amongst operators thanks to her personality, but Eunectes’s passion for her is on another level. \nIt isn’t hard to fathom why, of course. \nMost of us have probably been so awestruck by something we’ve never so much as heard of that it sent chills down our spines at some point in our lives. The kind of moment that feels as though you flung open a whole new door, like discovering new untrodden lands. To Eunectes, that moment came as a child when she witnessed a nomadic city just passing through by chance. The gigantic machine, colored in its icy machinery colors, struck her with amazement like never before. That moment came again when she first heard Lancet-2 talk. This time, it was the possibilities that robotics has that struck her with amazement. \nWouldn’t most operators be just as surprised when they first come across operations platforms that talk?  The difference here is that most operators aren’t all that interested in robots and therefore don’t react the same way Eunectes does. \nOn the other hand, while Eunectes shows extraordinary respect to other operations platforms as well, Lancet-2 is particularly dear to her. This is actually a glimpse of her normalcy. \nHer special treatment for Lancet-2 can be described as ritualistic and as a sort of emotional sustenance. This is a beacon she picked for herself in her new life, and it can even be seen as the manifestation of what she has always dreamt of achieving herself. \nWhich is why, even though she’s the developer of all the operations platforms and the person that Eunectes has come to look up to as her master, Closure has never tried to put a stop to her so-called “stupid apprentice’s” behavior.

By its very essence, it’s an idea that runs against their traditions—a breakthrough. \nFrom this point of view, you could say Gavial was the manifestation of tradition itself. She believed in her own strength and didn’t seek any outside help. Having abided by this principle for years, this has become one of the most iconic examples of Acahuallan tradition.\nIn other words, by its very essence, this series of events can be seen as a conflict between traditions and breakthroughs. If it wasn’t for Gavial’s relationship with Eunectes, if it wasn’t for the region’s lax sense of tradition to begin with, and how modest the Acahuallan people were, history tells us all this would have ended very badly. \nOf course, that is simply conjecture, and this isn’t to say that we were lucky things turned out the way they did. Rather, I wanted to pose an interesting question:\nIf Gavial and Eunectes each represented a different lifestyle—Gavial’s being the primitive yet free lifestyle while Eunectes represented a more orderly lifestyle that relied upon tools—would we be able to say for sure that one is more correct and would lead to a better life? \nTo take this question one step further, what makes a good lifestyle? \nThere isn’t a single correct answer to this question, but if you look at how Gavial and Eunectes are such polar opposites yet alike in some ways, I believe this would be an interesting question to ponder.",

And just like the impression that others typically have of Operator Arene himself, his Originium Arts typically strike others as beautiful yet dangerous, amicable yet seclusive, and requiring extra care to approach. \nDue to his frequent use of Arts, Arene himself usually carries a faint aromatic fragrance.

It is precisely for this reason that, when Arene contracted Oripathy several years ago, his parents opted to send him, their one and only son, away from danger to Leithania instead of keeping him close by. \nRegretfully, both of his parents were killed during a recent clandestine operation to steal Laterano firearms technology. Their will unfortunately brought Arene plenty of trouble as well—most people seem to believe that a parent would always leave every last thing they treasured to their children. In reality, the only thing that Arene’s parents ever wished for was for their only son to live a peaceful life. They knew their research would undoubtedly be taken up by Laterano departments far more up to the task than him. \nEven though the crisis has mostly been averted thanks to Operator Arene’s master plan, there still remains enough of a risk that, in spite of the young man’s temperament, the poor executor had to escort Arene to Rhodes Island to seek his colleague’s help, before taking a temporary leave to deal with some so-called problematic follow-up work. \nDuring his childhood, Arene’s parents were often preoccupied with work and had little time to spend with their son, leaving him alone at home most of his childhood. Young children often have a hard time understanding their parents’ passion for work. To the young Arene, it was guns that had stolen his parents’ attention from him, and that became the source of his apathy against guns, normally admired by Sankta children far and wide. Furthermore, after his infection during the accident, he lost any opportunity to have his own gun. \nPerhaps because he departed Laterano at an early age, Arene tends to be a little sheepish around some of our other Laterano operators. Instead, he is more proactive in interacting with our Leithanien operators. One such example is Operator Eyjafjalla.

We must acknowledge the reality that some people, completely without malice, grow up in an environment that teaches them to dehumanize the Infected. And that these people, even if they become Infected themselves, do not see the Infected as peers. It is difficult to reverse that perception.  \nLuckily, April’s cheerful disposition and open-minded personality did her well. While she had some ingrained discrimination against the Infected and some resultant self-loathing, she quickly shed these ideas thanks to our counseling and the general environment of life in Rhodes Island. She immediately began to think about how she could help others who also suffered like her. While she may not be that impressive in combat, April’s outlook and thinking are worthy of emulation. ",

It’s even worse than stubbing your little toe.” \nMint says she happened upon the book at an old marketplace near school, where all the shops sold old books and worn knick-knacks that had probably traded hands countless times, and where no shortage of questionably-legal goods moved around under wraps. \n”Don’t go in there expecting anything. People who treat it as one great treasure hunt by and large end up buying complete useless rubbish, ” stated Operator Skyfire on this topic. “If you honest-to-God know how to find something nice, you’ll find it.

In the words of her father: “This girl will not be a warrior.” \nIt is perhaps because he recognized this that her father did not permit Bubble to conceal her wounds and carry on with her life, and instead sent her away from the tribe, away from Sargon, and off to a new future of her own making. \n”At least here, she can have a happy life.” It’s hard to imagine such words came from a fierce tribal Cerato warrior, his body well over two meters tall covered head to toe in tattoos and totems. Not long after that conversation, our newly arrived Bubble came crashing through the reception room  door. Her father apologized profusely to the operator on duty, all the while holding the crying Bubble by her ear.

Strictly speaking, she cannot, since her standing is as a branch member of the Nearl family, which bars her from directly taking up the name. \nBut this was policy for the Nearl family at its shining peak. Following Nearl’s exile, it might’ve been simple enough, with all that she possessed, to seize the title of Nearl if she so wished. \nMind you, Whislash did not. \nOne part of it was her sisterly relationship with Maria. The other, as she saw it, was that the Nearl name held hallowed significance. \nIn a certain sense, her opinion overlaps with a true direct relative of Nearl’s and Blemishine’s, their uncle, Młynar—\"This is not a name I’d tarnish with such underhandedness.\" \nThough, sure enough, they define \"tarnishing\" in different ways. \nUnlike Młynar, Zofia does not reject the idea of the competition knight itself. Put another way, she accepts at least its existence—but does not err in her forthright and sporting approach to dueling, which she took to the competition as humble representative of the Nearl family. Unwilling to bow to any sponsors or firms, she went from start to finish lacking any favorable provisions or equipment, until the Final 16 brought her journey to an end. Even now, despite that gulf in equipment taking her left hand out of action indefinitely, she has no regrets. None—come the Major, she wants to make sure Blemishine continues to fight as she once did.  \nIt’s plain how in Whislash’s heart of hearts, her honor as a member of the Nearl family is unbreakable, and anyone could see how she looks after Nearl and Blemishine. When joining, she even assured us that if Rhodes Island wasn’t fit for purpose, she’d prefer to take Nearl and Blemishine with her to raise them herself. We’ve had some personnel envy the sisters in a way, having an elder who cares for them like that. ",

However, perhaps due to her young age when Nearl was expelled from Kazimierz, Blemishine seems to have a deeper and more natural connection with Whislash, as opposed to the pure admiration and longing she carries for her older sister. \nBlemishine is very outgoing, quickly striking it up with most operators. She even reveals her somewhat capricious side to those she is familiar with.

During her stay on the landship, Blemishine frequently made contact with Vulcan and Closure, and also visited other engineering enthusiasts such as Glaucus and Mayer. Reportedly, on several occasions, Blemishine wanted to ask if she could go to the Engineering Department to observe and study. Considering the prior times she was authorized and how she had gotten so engrossed with various workshops to the point of appearing MIA while being unable to extricate herself, these subsequent requests were tactfully rejected. \n“Having her around feels just like having a sister around, but her passion for craftsmanship is a little overboard.

              "storyText": "Before joining Rhodes Island, Miss Blemishine, also known as Maria Nearl, chose to become a competition knight in order to restore her family’s name. Those at Rhodes Island may perhaps be familiar with the name, Nearl, as the code name of Margaret Nearl, the Radiant Knight. However, in Kazimierz, the word “Nearl” points to an enduring lineage of knights, a family line wreathed in boundless glory. For over a hundred years, this family has produced countless legendary knights — whether using tactical brilliance to subvert the ambitions of Leithanien nobles, or employing their outstanding talents to hold a border garrison that has never fallen. Even after the rise of the competition knights, legendary champions such as Margaret Nearl continued to defend the glory of the Nearl family — but the birth of the Radiant Knight would prove to be turning point for the Nearl family. \nThe Radiant Knight was exiled, and when the Knight Primus passed of old age, Młynar Nearl, the next in line to shoulder the burden of nobility, scoffed at Kazimierz’s conception of “nobility” and refused to become a competition knight. And thus, the Nearl family was left with no Knight Primus. Faced with constant pressure from the Knights Association, as a last resort, the youngest member of the family, Maria Nearl, went with her aunt Zofia to walk the path of a competition knight. Due to her veneration of her sister and aunt, as well as the elder knights she had known since childhood, Maria always held an idealistic view of what it meant to be a knight. Of course, Maria was clever enough to recognize her naivete, often considering whether or not there was some darker undercurrent that was not yet clear to her. But the tortuous complexity of Kazimierz’s knight sports far exceeded what the young girl was capable of conceiving. \nIn her brief career as a knight, Blemishine was exposed to many things she had never witnessed before. The young Maria actually never thought too deeply about what it meant to be a knight— after all, she was acting out of consideration for her family, and was reluctantly pushed into becoming a knight out of a sense of responsibility. She took the initiative to assume both the glory and the obligations of her role, a testimony to her virtue, but perhaps because of her noble upbringing, she never seriously considered the relationship between what she saw, thought, and did. In modern society, noble sacrifices and selfless dedication are not as harrowing as they are described in literature, but Maria Nearl nevertheless embraced the simple rationale of “seizing glory for the family” and called upon the spirit of dedication within her, becoming known as the “unsociable competition knight.”",

But the birth of Kazimierz’s knight sports, as well as the existence of knighthood as a whole, are more complicated than most outsiders realize. \nRoughly 120 years ago, Kazimierz’s nomadic cities were far less developed than they are today. When a noble knight died without an heir, leaving behind a large swath of land, the Kazimierz National Council auctioned off his property. Specifically, the noble’s castle and the mobile platform it was built upon. While this was certainly not an uncommon occurrence in Kazimierz, what made this event remarkable was the winning bidder: not a knight representing some proud noble, but rather a subordinate of the deceased nobleman. A single knight-retainer had put forth a huge sum that rendered all the nobles in the room speechless. Furthermore, following notarization by the National Council, each piece of copper plate with which the retainer had purchased the land and the castle was determined to be legitimate income — the knight had handed the family business over to the retainer, who then made the business flourish. In the modern era in which countries jockey to establish connections, one can tell from a glance who has the ability to create wealth. In the following decades, the relationship between the merchant class and the retainers became more closely interconnected. The retainers were the ones who could truly create benefit for the country, able to build walls and even move city-states to defend the country. Due to the volatility between Kazimierz, Ursus, and Leithania, as well as the intrigue among powerful nobles, the knights had to rely on extremely wealthy guards to consolidate their positions and ambitions. After decades of cruel, bloody change, Kazimierz has finally arrived where it is today. \nIf the overthrow of Kazimierz’s Elder regime and the establishment of the knights as the ruling class is Kazimierz’s first historical turning point, then the upending of their rule by the mercantile-retainers in a practical sense and the formation of Kazimierz’s oligarchical ruling class can undoubtedly be seen as a second turning point. Even the knights and nobles who are quite critical of this development do concede that modern entrepreneurs have made outstanding contributions to Kazimierz — from the forested countryside to the towering spires of the city-states, countless people rely on Kazimierz’s corporate economy for food, housing, and transportation — “It’s the economy, stupid.” \nThe current knight sports industry is the result of this bloody social upheaval — the warrior-knights guarding the frontier have all but lost their political status as “nobles.” Instead, they became warriors directly operating under the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi Kazimierz. Any legal Kazimierz citizen, former noble knight or otherwise, has the right to participate in the knight competitions, win titles, and earn distinctions of nobility, regardless of background. This sporting event, derived from ancient knightly tests of skill, has become an inseparable part of Kazimierz’s economy, politics, and culture. Nevertheless, these changes are not palatable for all knights, and undercurrents continue to surge within Kazimierz. \n“Unreasonable, you say? Everyone who found it unreasonable has been eliminated, creating this thoroughly reasonable history. Fortunately, I’ve accepted this truth. You understand this, don’t you?” —Spokesman Malkiewicz’s conversation with the Doctor during the Major",

Before her lies an expansive, but lonely, future. Maria understands her immaturity better than anyone else, so she has taken the name of “Blemishine” to reflect the incompleteness of her light. \nMaria has a favorite knight novel. In the novel, the protagonist experiences bizarre adventures on the way to completing his quest, and this occupies 95% of the book. At the end of the book, the middle-aged knight, no longer needed by his family, no longer favored by the Knight Order, and no longer burdened by his love affair, decides to leave. In a distant seaside country, he once again finds his home as a knight, charging against the waves again and again until his voice becomes hoarse, and he is eventually consumed by the ocean— this abrupt ending was once lambasted by more conservative readers, and this novel is the subject of many intense discussions within the circles of Kazimierz’s literary critics. Some say the novel is trash, but others consider the ending a completion of the sublimation of chivalry. \nMaria likes the novel for one simple reason - though many think the tale of puritanical, almost crazed sacrifice incompatible with Maria’s personality, Maria found an answer to her own questions in the old novel penned during the early days of Kazimierz’s knight sports: the meaning of meaning. \nWhile sitting alone with the Doctor and reflecting on the occurrences in Kazimierz, Maria suddenly smiled and said: “My sister is the knight who broke the waves.” From the perspective of Maria, younger sister of the Radiant Knight, we gain a glimpse of why Nearl, who always despised knight sports, chose to become Kazimierz’s Radiant Knight and why she decided to return to her homeland, only to be exiled again after defeating a powerful enemy. If we treat her pure faith as a prayer of sorts, the Radiant Knight’s series of shocking behaviors may actually be the exact same as those of the ancient Wanderer Knight who went to pay homage to the ancestors in front of the grave at the Lone Mountain. \nMaria eventually decided to become her sister’s protector, using her exceptional crafting talents to provide assistance to the Radiant Knight. Even Mechanist praised her augmented knight armor. She acted like a little sister when vying for Margaret’s attention, and acted like a knight when receiving Zofia’s training. She learned to put behind her the things that burdened her in the past. Now, she only wants to know what they, the knights of Kazimeriz, can see hand-in-hand, after the waves have washed away their lances and shields.",

Beyond that, she has a natural gift, having grasped several classic and characteristically Leithanien Arts forms as well as an ancient, bloodline-tied Sarkaz witchcraft. This witchcraft lets her consciousness forcibly \"intervene\" in her constructs' bodies, allowing what was the unthinking stone and soil to become her own four limbs extended. For example, it's like the difference between holding a sword in her hands, and her hands themselves becoming a sword. Put another way, from the angle of combat efficiency, not much difference at all. These special Originium Arts prove Mudrock's Sarkaz blood still flows pure, but aren't effective for strengthening her constructs' fighting capabilities. However, this is only in terms of the Arts Mudrock presently displays. Considering her future growth, as well as innate talent shown in her self-taught use of Leithanien Arts systems, perhaps these ancient bloodborne methods may become a table-turning ace in the hole of hers.     \nMeriting additional attention is that Mudrock will occasionally refer to her Originium Arts constructs as \"friends,\" both Colossus and small as soil clumps alike. We can be sure that Mudrock does not bestow this title purely from her own individuality or personal interest. Perhaps Mudrock's special Originium Arts make her regard her arisen constructs with emotion, similar to a handy tool one has used for decades. Or, perhaps, her prolonged use of witchcraft has given her some curious affinity with the stone and soil. We request to all Operators that should you find Mudrock alone in her room giving a petite clay figure a sweet smile you've never seen before, please, do not be surprised.

As a result of her rebelling against Reunion's advocacy of violence, Mudrock had absolutely no involvement with Reunion in the reign of terror that befell Ursus. On the contrary, she led her like-minded Sarkaz for Leithania long before, hoping that in a nation of highly developed Originium Arts, prosperous yet rotten to the core, they could find some place in which to hide away. Mudrock knew well that Leithania's cities and Spires wouldn't readily admit bloodstained Sarkaz mercenaries, so they elected to wander between remote cities, attracting more and more of Leithania's Infected during this time. Her benevolence, rare amongst mercenaries, earned her quite the following. Before she realized it, the reputation of the Mudrock Squad had spread across the Infected though she often trails off, blushing, when the topic comes up. It seems that she doesn’t like to talk about her “glorious” moment of popularity.     \nYet all good things come to an end. The vengeful lust of the \"Reunion Movement\" was never contained within reason's reach. While Leithania as a whole had a milder treatment of the Infected, these conflicts naturally spread through other areas due to ulterior motives. After enduring the calamity led by a string of out-of-control riots, Mudrock despondently decided to return to Kazdel, hoping to establish a shelter for her people there.   \nHowever, this plan was also cut short, again by outside forces she couldn't defy. When Elite Operator Logos came across the Mudrock Squad in Kazdel, there were hardly any Sarkaz warriors left by her side, and the minds, spirits, and bodies of the Leithanien Infected who now outnumbered the original members were on the verge of collapse. As for what even happened to the Mudrock Squad between leaving Leithania and arriving at Rhodes Island, or why Mudrock decided differently at the last minute, we're not at all clear. However, without a doubt, they suffered disastrous losses from some Leithanian power pursued them out of Leithania.

Rhodes Island Operator Atro lost her life in this incident, and the team of Operators dispatched to investigate the incident came into conflict with the Mudrock Squad. However, asked \"whether Mudrock had engaged in unforgivable conduct,\" Operator Folinic hesitated for a brief moment before issuing a denial. \nAs for the \"after,\" this refers to what followed Mudrock's decisive battle (this wording is in line with the situation at the time, and can be seen as a deliberate effort on Mudrock's part) with Rhodes Island's operators, her defeat, and subsequent withdrawal from Wolumonde.  The sudden fires and revolts gave the Wolumonde officials grounds to recall the Gendarmerie from the nobles. With the Gendarmerie's aid, the afflicted cities successfully established a passage across the Great Rift. Messengers and supply teams arrived soon after at Wolumonde.  After the ordeal, Wolumonde was deeply wounded, not just due to the loss during the conflict and rioting. \"Close to a fifth of Wolumonde's people betrayed Leithania.\" This shadow cast itself deep into the hearts of the locals, and even roused whatever conscience still remained in some of their nobles—and the problems they faced were quite convoluted. \nBased on letters sent by Messengers responsible for the follow-up investigations, with the professional evaluation of the Gendarmerie, we can confirm that the main instigator of the Wolumonde incident, Biederman, died in the riots. The local Schultz was taken in due to his acute Oripathy, and whether he is alive or dead remains unclear. Soon after, the nobles withdrew Wolumonde's autonomy, deciding to merge its intact areas with surrounding cities in the coming spring. \nJudging by the \"experiences\" Mudrock described, what the Mudrock Squad and Leithanien Infected saw in Wolumonde was just the tip of the iceberg. You can imagine why the Leithanien Infected within the Mudrock Squad were in such low spirits. We cannot help but recognize that obedience within the Infected's giant cages, giving up freedom may be the only way to eke out an existence in Leithania. \n\n[Classified Log]\nOn the first night the local nobles arrived to investigate Wolumonde, there was an assassination attempt. After failing, the suspect fled near the Winterwisp Mountains, where he committed suicide by biting his tongue off. He was identified as the local Schultz’s only son, Thorwald, who was thought to have died in the fire. The Gendarmerie found a letter on his person: \"I've changed my mind. I'll die in your stead. But there's one thing you have to do for me. If you recognize him, get rid of him.\" Because of this letter, and the token of a Catastrophe Messenger carried on the suspect's person, we can confirm that the suspect was an accomplice to Biederman. The noble did not make things harder on Severin Hawthorn, whose life was already in grave danger, but it was obvious he had no good will to spare, and so left Wolumonde. Considering that several other operators are involved in this matter, only a small number of authorized personnel and the Doctor are permitted to view this document.",

That's right... It was an artificial implant. Having referenced Raidian's inspection report, we can say for certain that this device is unmistakably artificial in nature. \n\nIf, just like this particular subject, Specter's Infection was artificially induced... Leaving aside the question of how Specter's immune system is able to fight her Originium infection so fiercely... the liquid Originium density in Specter's cerebrospinal fluid has already reached such a high level that her life is undeniably in danger. We had to resort to all kinds of measures just to prevent her situation from getting any worse, as we naturally should do. \nLet's look at the experiment that was performed on this particular individual. One of the objectives of this experiment was to figure out how to contain the Originium Infection and the negative effects it produces. \nAnd they managed to pull it off, albeit only temporarily. \nFrom the project's inception, their plan was to create an individual who is not afflicted by Oripathy but is nonetheless an Infected. A caster who doesn't need an Arts Unit. A master of Originium Arts who does not need to be trained in its theory. \nHer Infected organs do not exacerbate the Originium density in her body in any way. In a certain sense, this individual is as good as not Infected. \nWith her life functions still in perfect order, should we really remove this artificial organ? The organ that lets her breathe and swallow, and lets her blood flow normally? \nI'm afraid we haven't met that requirement. No one has. This experiment is likely impossible to reproduce in the short term, and we are supposed to reverse its results, to return her body composition to normal? \n\nThe Loken Watertank Laboratory is a shambles. The little research data they had were all wiped out as well. We will likely never know whether the data was destroyed or successfully retrieved by its sponsor. The lab's actual proprietor would prefer to keep news of the scandal under wraps. The technological companies looking to thrive in the wake of Loken Watertank's downfall are likely a dime a dozen, and who knows how many spies there are in the Columbian cities? \nLoken Williams was a genius, but his ignorance and apathy led to the deaths of many, including his own in the very end. Poetic justice, no doubt. \nThe Maylander Child Rights Protection Foundation's rescue of the individual from the laboratory ruins and their subsequent exfiltration from the country were the result of its board's careful deliberation. They were intent on keeping Loken's research results out of the hands of Columbian companies and interest groups. If the research conducted at Loken was allowed to continue to ferment, it would only result in further instability. This will not be tolerated. They will not allow it. They would rather pretend it happened in the first place. \nIn the end, the girl ended up under my care... Perhaps by fate, or perhaps because, along with Loken's mentor, I was the one who ended Loken's life as an Oripathy researcher in Columbian academia. But we both knew it in our hearts that he wasn't going to be stopped by that. It was nowhere close to enough to stop someone who would claim the lives of everyone who walks upon this land for his own benefit. \nWith this, our cooperation with Maylander came to an end. This would be the final mission ever to be sanctioned by them and carried out in secret by us. This individual, the experimental subject, will forever disappear from Columbia's records. \n\nMaylander doesn't care if she lives or dies. What happens to her from here onwards is up to us. \nBut what would her treatment—the removal of this artificial organ—entail? The damage this has on her system may be minimal. \nThe device does not have a replacement function. It had never crossed their minds to implement such a function. \nThe device has already become a part of the individual. They turned her Arts Unit... into her life source. \nI don't have the right to ask her to give up her own life. \n...However, ethics is a matter between you and me, not Rhodes Island. \n\n——Dr. Kal'tsit",

There isn't very much we can say about that...\nHowever, her Arts... Well, we've stopped holding the tests indoors already, but the data we got from the tests before explains a lot. \nI guess it's not a good idea to talk theories here. I mean, I don't really understand theories myself. The theoretical casters are always talking about stuff like perception reversal and thought impetus. Seems to have to do with cognitive science and neurology, and things I'm bound to never understand. \nLet's just talk about her Arts' performance. Right, I mean, there's quite a lot that's classified, and this information is just here to give you the gist. \nSome of us have started to call her Arts her spiritual entity. After all... This is a very fitting and convenient way to describe it. \nHer Arts can stretch out into a wide \"net\" that can detect the movements of objects within its range. The \"net\" covers a huge area, and most people are unaware of her \"touch\". Her Arts can also be used on just a single individual. I suppose it's like a big hand... I've tried asking her to keep her Arts's range to the smallest area possible, but, even then, she can only manage to shrink it down to a few square meters. I'm guessing that's because she's trying to \"grip\" her target. Aside from that, it doesn't seem she can use this power on the inside of her target. Even when we gave her a transparent pitcher with its innards clearly visible, she couldn't make the pitcher burst from the inside. All she could do was squeeze it from the outside. This looks even more and morelike a flexible, malleable force-exerting entity. \nDuring the test process, still going by that \"hand\" and \"grip\" imagery, we surmised she's able to use at most four of those large, shapeless \"hands\" of hers when her concentration is at its peak. It seems the test results were measured based on her Arts' activity and deep water testing. Both her speed and strength measurements go to show that there is tremendous power hiding in her Arts, yet we aren't even able to detect any signs of her using her Arts before they break something. \nWhy just four, and why are they all shapeless \"hands\"? Is that how she imagines them? Indeed, when we were examining the deformation of her targets' structures, we can't help but think that some of the bumps might be the gaps between her fingers...\nAnd whenever there was a considerable temperature difference, she would also seem to get frostbite or burns when she uses her Arts... neurally speaking, at least. There weren't any apparent symptoms. She would just say... \"It's cold\"... or \"It hurts\". And based on her cerebral cortex's activity, it's true. \n(The voice in the recording gets softer)\nI heard an explanation that's kinda out there... even scary. \nThey say her brother still lives within her. And her Arts are like... her brother reaching out his hands, either hugging the land or pounding it with force. \nI have no idea who was the first person to say that. It's unsettling. \n\n——Recording of Field Reporter Caster KK",

I have no idea if this is Kal'tsit or Outcast's idea, but there's no doubt she's got better thanks to this. \nShe's not like the other experimentation victims I've seen. They're either always screaming their lungs out, or they've already lost their ability to live and take care of themselves; they're always just curled up in their vessels, trembling. \nMy first impression is that she is from a middle-class family and has received a certain amount of education. But when her mental state is unstable, the destruction she wreaks on the ship sure is a terrifying sight to behold. \nShe fears laboratories. She hates medical equipment. And even though our equipment is already several times hardier than normal armor, she even managed to lift one up into the air and crushed it into a ball about the size of a fist. I suppose if it wasn't for Logos, all of us would've long been dead several times over. \nBut thanks to that, we now have a pretty good picture of the kind of life she lived. Kal'tsit has recently requested Engineering to renovate some of the laboratories and rehab sickrooms.

Or perhaps this is the result that she wanted, and her Arts helped her achieve that. \nHer Arts definitely isn't as simple as a kind of telekinesis. Her past torments her, and that's why she's trying to erase her memories. But she also isn't able to control the strong, unorderly emotions left over... It's a mess. Then, she gets upset that she's forgotten again, and gets anxious and confused because of that. She gets distressed for not meeting our expectations, even though we'd be more than willing to cheer her on and help her. She will still blame herself. \nAt the very least, it's not possible for us to retrace her participation in the experiments. She has practically dug her entire brain out. It's a violent way to go about it, almost like she sealed herself away. Her amnesic symptoms might even be side effects of this behavior. \nHer cognitive ability is being exhausted by herself relentlessly. My guess is her artificial organ is using it up to deal with her ongoing stress. \n\nI think she needs a recorder. I will make her a terminal. One that's easy to type on. That way she can go over her notes whenever she wants, dig up those scenes and dialogues she wants, and restore her emotions back to the truths in her head and reorganize them. Just like giving a movie its dialogues back. \nOnce she asked me why I wouldn't let her wear shoes in the room. As I explained the safety side of it, I also thought of borrowing a pair of shoes from Amiya for her to wear when she leaves the cabin. Amiya came over herself. She even brought with her a new pair of shoes, and were they not a perfect fit. The two kids were fast friends. Amiya was very skilled at comforting her. \nI thought to myself. That was the moment the patient's life truly began instead of some point in the past. There are still lots of mysteries surrounding her, but what does any of that matter? \nKal'tsit said she'll put up a poll for the casters and medical elite operators after a while. I'm in engineering, so I'm not voting, but if I had a vote, I would probably vote to let her stay on the island. If what she needs is someone to guide her through her stress, to teach her how to control her Arts, then we're the right men for the job. \n\n——Indistinct personal records found inside a folder.",

              "storyText": "Loken Watertank isn't the source of the problem. \nWhen it all happened, Loken was likely under a lot of pressure. Otherwise, knowing his personality, he would not have made such a gamble. \nI'm not trying to defend him, but by trying to dissect his actions, I might also be able to verify a few of my viewpoints. \nMy guess is that he urgently needed some test results that supported his hypothesis, either to get his hands on some resources, to maintain his position, or to preserve his project. \nLoken implanted this artificial organ in this particular subject only because his research had to do with the Infected. If his research was in the bionics, then no matter how many of her organs ended up getting replaced, the subject would not have had even the tiniest traces of Oripathy. \nThe subject and her brother were dragged into this mess only because they had a somewhat unique gift in Originium Arts... Their adoption after their family was destroyed, their fraudulent guardian, the corrupt orphanage all played a hand. \nI won't rule out the possibility. Maylander's report clearly says that Loken murdered her brother to fulfill his experiment's objectives. The direct cause of the incident was that the \"consciousness\" that he forcefully extracted from her brother activated her Infected organ. \nWhether this is purely a product of her imagination or is indeed just like what was reflected by the errors in the scans... It's eerie, I know. But her \"brother\" might still exist somewhere in her brain. She probably doesn't want to know about this yet—This stems from her subconscious refusal, or perhaps it's the wishes of her \"brother\". \nExccessive theoretical neuroscience intersts me not. Such experiment was entirely profit-driven. Its data was tainted by blood. This kind of data can only be used to back theories that support war and violence. We don't need that. \nLoken Watertank had been under the table for long. The fact that a laboratory of its size was able to direct such deep, inhumane crimes just goes to show how far down this road of privilege Columbia's scientific research has come. \nCompared to Ursus and Sargon, Columbia's laws are no doubt more advanced and stringent. But how severe the law is has nothing to do with how many crimes have gone unpunished.it actually is. Both the ones who enforce the law and those who administer it are only people. A progressive society carries the burden of being even more \"civilized\". \nThat's how that fate befell her. Just simply because they needed her to be an Infected, they wanted her to have those powers, being able to expand her Arts casting by the way of compressing her consciousness... \n\nPerhaps it was Volwotkeczynski or Rhine Lab... and it's a bit of a stretch, but it could also have been pharmaceutical companies like Parasol or Tower Mountains... but in any case... It doesn't matter who Loken Watertank's benefactors were. \nWhoever they are, there's an even bigger disaster waiting for them sooner or later. \n\nSo, the vote's results... My guess is there are two votes against. \nLogos agreed as well, didn't he? Hm? No, I’m not surprised. You may think he doesn't care about anything other than Kazdel affairs, but if that was the case, he wouldn't have agreed to become an elite operator in the first place. \nIt's just like those two to vote no... Pith was against it, and I suppose that's only natural. \nI'll persuade them. \nOf course, you guys practically forced this one on me. Right, Touch, you guys voted yes. You guys should be the ones to persuade them. I'm merely trying to speed things up. \nMy reason for doing this? \nI was giving her a checkup this morning, and she asked me if I remember what her name was. \nShe wants to know what she used to be called. She's slowly trying to face her past... even if it's already ruined her once. Or perhaps she should get a new name. \n...If our cities and our residents are truly more advanced than the bloodthirsty barbarians of ages past, then we must at least prove that our personalities have improved. \nPreventing science from being used to harm the innocent is also a responsibility of mine. \nPerhaps it's still too early to give her a name. She should come up with her name herself. But we can give her a codename right now. \nI believe that by becoming an operator, her future, as well as that of the world itself, will become that much brighter. Now that all of you agreed, I promise I will teach her. She will still become your family... Your teammate. \nShe can do it. \n[In the old mythologies, there exists a miraculous plant that helps those who cannot face their memories to be brave and courageous. From here on out, her codename will be Rosmontis. ]",

On the other hand, mildly infected individuals like Jackie aren't able to channel much energy for Arts. \nFor this reason, even Infected Casters often prefer to cast Arts through an Arts Unit whenever possible. Similarly, Rhodes Island provides an Arts Unit to every Caster operator. \n——In fact, the Engineering Department is very passionate about designing Arts Units of all shapes and sizes. One of their favorite pastimes is developing \"Arts Units\" that look nothing like conventional units— and often don't work at all. \nThe Arts Unit that hangs at Jackie's waist, gun-type Arts Unit PT-29, is the pride of the Engineering Department. \nRegrettably, even though Jackie applied for such an Arts Unit, it is only due to a habit formed while serving as an auxiliary police officer. Jackie herself is incredibly uninterested in the subject of Arts and her scores are very disappointing. Because of this, this Arts Unit is mostly an accessory to this day.",

Jackie greatly reveres her father. \nShe will happily describe in great detail how amazing of a policeman her father is, how many people he's helped and what accolades he's received. Some of her teammates can even recite her entire speech from beginning to end by heart now. \nHer story may be hyperbolic to some extent, but her father was still willing to bring his own infected daughter to Rhodes Island in person. Throughout his short stay in Rhodes Island, he never openly displayed any animosity towards the other Infected, and even remained agreeable to his daughter joining Rhodes Island after learning about some of Rhodes Island's more dubious activities. At the very least, he is not overly biased towards the Infected, even if he is just exercising self-restraint. That alone is already very rare amongst the non-Infected. \nJackie's good manners and lively attitude in daily life is likely also a result of her father's teachings. \nFrom that perspective, her father is indeed a policeman worth respecting, and a good father.",

After overcoming her initial horror, she was able to quickly come to terms with her new identity as an Infected. \nIt is possible that since she was showered in love from a young age, Jackie has a great capacity for love towards others——This can be considered a legitimate ability, as rare as it is. After coming to Rhodes Island, not only did this ability allow her to befriend others easily, it also gave her a new goal——To help the other Infected. \nBesides curing her Oripathy, she also wants to lend a hand to the other Infected. To her, it is only natural to do so.",
